poem written year ago live woods period van gogh moon tonight hemlocks form room night light looks like van gogh moon everything changing soon could go anyplace south keys anyone house night light van gogh moon yeah everything changing soon bottle fire side steady burning last pride feel glow van gogh moon everything changing soon sleep coming mountains soon van gogh moon hoping everything changing soon pettit
