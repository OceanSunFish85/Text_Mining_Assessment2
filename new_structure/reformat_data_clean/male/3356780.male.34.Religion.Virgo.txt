depressives samples studied groups around world searching cause schizophrenia hunting genetic clues others traces virus faulty neurotransmitter edible vaccines researchers developed method infusing potatoes vaccination traveler diarrhea potatoes become living low cost vaccine factories contain virulent agents cause infection could become low cost way delivering vaccines third world treating age

individual diseases anticipated worthbillion sales byeradicate polio global campaign led world health organization unicef rotary international uscdc could eradicate polio next years next target measles despite effective vaccine kills million annually designer hormones tamoxifen originally developed contraceptive failed actually almost guaranteed woman would become pregnant estrogen binding

epidemic taking terrible toll africa asia un anticipates large population decrease areas million africans million indians infected unless cure found whole countries could simply cease exist stem cells one controversial researches involves fetal brain stem cells used grow virtually organ tissue without problems rejection us ban fetal research limited availability cells study recent experiment led ability multiply fetal brain stem cells laboratory leading potentially endless supply avoiding ethical problem led ban cancer vaccines new process underway develop vaccines teach body cure cancers new
