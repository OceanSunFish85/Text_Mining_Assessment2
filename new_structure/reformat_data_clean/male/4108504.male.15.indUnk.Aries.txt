well typing response stephanie lj post mentioning sonic youth mudhoney ended ranting songwriting long post sonic youth awesome influence lot love progressive style arrangements mixed conventional poppish hooks really fond mellow yet errie tones along experimental noise aspects experimental novelty experimental complements song takes another level even like apathy driven college rock bored tired rock give fuck vibe thurston shaggy hair gotta love crazy jaguars p want take bit love writing prog without prog songs long arrangements still structure around unlike shit like dream theater song ideas one maybe return original basis theme end support song p conventional structure perhaps different extensions make interesting without going overboard along lines intro melody melody increase presence perhaps harmonizing guitars bass drums come something builds upon previous without different whole verse like verse typical even number measures instead repeating measure phrases maybe interesting meas phrase measures leading next section perhaps incomplete lyric leave hanging song moves pre chorus still interesting skipped especially verse notable variations sometimes different section needed ascend chorus song cut chase always needed chorus generally rememberable hook worthy section course lot times drastic dynamic shift really set chorus apart maybe even key change loud verses quiet choruses vice versa set song apart conventional ways structuring pre verse always needed sometimes helps song may become seem generic fast goes straight back verse short interlude sort usually helps move song along verse find important something previously absent come second verse lift song perhaps new corresponding melody vocal harmonies needs something separate first need carbon copy first different lyrics interlude think going straight chorus verse bit conventional times helps brand new section move song along give personality make sure long function basically extend verse introduce new aspect keep listener entertained chorus second chorus like second verse often needs new aspect introduced familiar part interlude lifting song second chorus stand still flow anticlimatic interlude leading carbon copy previous chorus often chaotic section song dynamic terms following section dynamic reset open whole new soundscape possibilities get certain point really build anymore going back level kind gives song chance rebuild keep song flowing trying get chaotic seem tedious want song get even extreme building later calmer standpoint capture intent much better bridge next sections song really gets chance shine personally think choruses really needed point depends song perhaps unique outro chorus exception mentioned good idea dynamic reset previous sections quiet good place pack punch allow song evolve previous sections building good place breakdown allow build climax rest song really depends specific intent may want keep whatever dynamic reached rest song finish song outro epic thing buildup chaotic climax chaotic second chorus perhaps guitar solo verse built upon previously unheard basis place creative anything put good use experimental pay well song bridge nearly length really needs notably longer previous sections climax nearly anything fit well used efficiently dynamic shift definitely needed want avoid lulling vibe section compromised many parts keep mind overdo key change may work well used properly importance good writing far particularly innovative experimental used help efficiency key whatever works bad bridge particularly long may good idea outro directly following climax perhaps climax outro instead climax may want build back verse dynamic different find work efficiently want outro chorus outro outro chance creative completely new part may introduced key changes dynamic shifts welcome previous sections noticably different might want return familiar variation beginning section outro choruses work find boring unless preceded dynamic shifting verse really main options end fade stop seguing another song course depends writer song diversity key nothing wrong conventional arranged songs helps lot example structure song geek u smashing pumpkins one favorite songs time really like way structured intro drums guitar bass guitar overdubs enter increasing excitement verse chorus pre verse guitars revise back original intro riff lead guitar lines lead next verse verse interlude like mentioned earlier going back chorus would boring brand new parts introduced interesting overdubbed double lead guitar parts lead next chorus making chaotic complete exaggerated last word interlude seeking beginning chorus chorus bridge song dynamic reset half tempo feel quiet peaceful vibe quiet singing still flows key changes well double lead guitars ascend eerie feedback fade key changes song immediately bursts back heavy crushing distorted guitars double lead guitars return playing melodic harmonies previous warning crescendos etc dynamic shift except perhaps slight exaggeration last two words sung despite immediate dynamic shift song still remains relaxed particularly still slower half tempo feel objective keep listener entertained dynamic shift good job keeping attention last chord held two measures drum fill hints change going ensue climax song immediately picks tempo doubles eerie fast adrenaline rush guitar solo lifts song previously unfamiliar high exactly guitar solo used showing lifting song new point guitar solo definitely job well song back original fast exciting pace new verse introduced chord progression solo previous lead guitar overdubbed lead guitar proceed come solo experimental chaotic feedback harmonics random weird noise focus course singing since verse eerie noises keep pace make sure song revert previous level since store lot balance dynamics way guitars mixed produced album rhythm guitars thick heavy presence heavy fuzz lead guitars slightly hollow lot midrange drop lot presence lost verse ends double lead guitars playing octave melody corresponds progression times exaggerated accented hits drums synch guitar hints another change ensuing last chord repeated progression previous chord progression repeats small double guitar solo proceeds keep song flowing climax climax heh song breaks without really breaking yes know make sense guitars end one note loads eerie feedback bass plays new half tempo melody undearneath hinting change guitars descend presence giving pick scrape accented drum fill leads outro outro guitars double previous bass melody song back slower pace outro verse lead guitar lines corresponding places variations riff instruments end unison song fades feedback song clocks atwhich suprisingly short take consideration much stuff goes song one primary reasons wanted play guitar know inside p really clue typed stuff sorry guess add rockstar kit p alternate theory everything write stuff sounds cool p first bought big muff resists urge giggle insanely fuzz pedal everybody like omg mudhoney uses never really heard guess check wow really long p
