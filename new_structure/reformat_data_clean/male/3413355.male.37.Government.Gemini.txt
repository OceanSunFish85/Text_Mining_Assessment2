beginnings photography first name owe name photography sir john herschel first used term year photographic process became public word derived greek words light writing mentioning stages led development photography one amazing quite uncanny prediction made man called de la rochein work called giphantie imaginary tale possible capture images nature canvas coated sticky substance surface tale goes would provide mirror image sticky canvas would remain dried dark image would remain permanent author would known prophetic tale would decades death two distinct scientific processes combine make photography possible somewhat surprising photography invented earlier 1830s processes known quite time two distinct scientific processes put together photography came first processes optical camera obscura dark room existence least four hundred years drawing dated camera obscura leonardo da vinci period use aid drawing advocated second process chemical hundreds years photography invented people aware example colours bleached sun made little distinction heat air light sixteen hundreds robert boyle founder royal society reported silver chloride turned dark exposure appeared believe caused exposure air rather light angelo sala early seventeenth century noticed powdered nitrate silver blackened sun johann heinrich schulze discovered certain liquids change colour exposed light beginning nineteenth century thomas wedgwood conducting experiments successfully captured images silhouettes could survive known method making image permanent first successful picture produced june july ni pce using material hardened exposure light picture required exposure eight hours january ni pce agreed go partnership louis daguerre ni pce died four years later daguerre continued experiment soon discovered way developing photographic plates process greatly reduced exposure time eight hours half hour also discovered image could made permanent immersing salt following report invention paul delaroche leading scholar day french government bought rights july details process made public august daguerre named daguerreotype announcement daguerreotype requires knowledge drawing anyone may succeed perform well author invention greeted enormous interest daguerreomania became craze overnight interesting account days given writer called gaudin present day announcement made however people welcomed exciting invention pundits viewed quite sinister terms newspaper report leipzig city advertiser stated wish capture evanescent reflections impossible mere desire alone blasphemy god created man image man made machine may fix image god possible god abandoned eternal principles allowed frenchman give world invention devil time artists saw photography threat livelihood see artists photography even prophesied painting would cease exist daguerreotype process though good expensive picture affair many would regarded disadvantage meant owner portrait could certain piece art could duplicated however two copies required way coping use two cameras side side therefore growing need means copying pictures daguerreotypes could never satisfy different sense rival daguerreotype calotype invented william henry fox talbot provide answer problem paper royal society london dated january actually precedes paper daguerre entitled account art photogenic drawing process natural objects may made delineate without aid artist pencil wrote charming would possible cause natural images imprint durably remain fixed paper earliest paper negative know produced august depicts famous window lacock abbey home negative small square poor quality compared striking images produced daguerreotype process however talbot made significant improvements able bring photographically illustrated book entitled pencil nature see note compared daguerreotypes quality early calotypes somewhat inferior see comments claudet however great advantage talbot method unlimited number positive prints could made see also brewster fact today photography based principle whereas comparison daguerreotype quality blind alley mushrooming photographic establishments reflects photography growing popularity mere

photographs produced substance architecture landscapes portraiture simply possible progress new art slow england compared countries daguerre fox talbot partly responsible former rather slyly placed patent invention whilst french government made freely available world latter law suits connection patents new era photography introduced frederick scott archer introduced collodion process process much faster conventional methods reducing exposure times two three seconds thus opening new horizons photography prices daguerreotypes varied general would cost guineawhich would weekly wage many workers collodion process however much cheaper prints could made little one shilling 5p impetus given photography masses introduction carte de visite photographs andre disd ri developed mania though relatively short lived collodion process required coating exposure development image done whilst plate still wet another process developed archer named ambrotype direct positive wet collodion process though time great step forward required considerable amount equipment location various attempts preserve exposed plates wet collodion development convenient time place preservatives lessened sensitivity material clear dry method required likely difficulties process hastened search instantaneous photography skaife pamphlet aptly commented speaking general instantaneous photography elastic term expression long short next major step forward came dr richard maddox discovered way using gelatin discovered years instead glass basis photographic plate led development dry plate process dry plates could developed much quickly previous technique initially insensitive compared existing processes refined extent idea factory made photographic material becoming possible introduction dry plate process marked turning point longer one need cumbersome wet plates longer darkroom tent needed one near day pictures could taken without photographer needing specialised knowledge celluloid invented early eighteen sixties john carbutt persuaded manufacturer produce thin celluloid backing sensitive material george eastman particularly remembered introducing flexible film four years later introduced box camera photography could reach much greater number people names significance include herman vogel developed means whereby film could become sensitive green light eadweard muybridge
