proof radian equal pi radian defined unit angular measure equal angle subtended center circle arc equal length radius circle english means radian sector circle whose radii equal length included arc looks somewhat like may familiar degree radian ratio thus radian pi approx 57 simple proof involves finding length arc sector probably know circumference circle pi pi r use find length part circumference e arc multiply pi r bywhere supposed represent theta angle sector example quarter circle isso find length arc sector use formula length arc pi rpi rpi r example let use simple radius like pito p simplified formula length arc l pi rnow want find value radian set l equal r e length arc equals radius sector formula becomes r pi rnow rearrange terms multiply 180r pi r divide r 180r r pi simplify pi divide pipi since angle sector whose arc equals radius defined radian easy
