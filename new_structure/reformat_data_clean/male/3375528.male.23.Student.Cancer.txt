fired shows broadcast determined indecent largely fines brought universal outrage unlike superbowl incident radio indecency fines originate single complaint individuals actively asserting control broadcasting acting public interests mind instead operating ulterior religious motives however impossible change situation may look many potential solutions solutions vary complexity possible solution may work imperative situation reversed one way potentially reverse crackdown remove fcc ability fine fcc legal ability fine reason conflict interest exists organization charge licensing regulating fact rules fining system fcc implemented enough reason stop fcc fining indecent show air several stations one station incurring fine clear amount fine decided either amounts completely subjective fcc like allowing cops pull speeding sign issuing ticket subjective amount speed gets pulled vary day day amount varies much one would ever stand type governmental abuse actions similar past secret police russia germany entity nature exist government fact clear definition indecent another reason strip fcc ability fine would much effective broadcaster developed set standards could abused universal broadcasting policy designed remove needless shock air broadcast standards could include certain situations shocking broadcasting allowed broadcasters watching broadcasters would effective government entity regulating broadcasters punishment violating decency standards would industry self regulation would effective industry public watching therefore broadcaster indecent obscene public outcry would

operation much smaller clearly defining exactly indecent obscene another step remedying situation terms deemed indecent excluded first amendment thus spoken medium legally obscenity protected constitution thus subject persecution term loosely defined concrete definition regulate clear direct definition indecent obscene needed another option would put ability censor publics hand method regulating media past successful relies free market business theory product marketable stay consumer market viewer decision make offensive material broadcast viewer changes channel ratings drop advertisers get return advertising show watched therefore advertisers put commercials shows poor ratings show unprofitable either fixed canceled instead involving government consumers directly regulating air method added benefit regulated consumers using action instead complaints ability one group alter media content becomes marginalized current system group complains enough action taken fcc indecent fcc go broadcaster right wing groups complain enough allowing consumer right decide decent popular desire nation reflected shows like howard stern elliot morning remain air principal lots people like shows forced watch stern offended entire audience would removed air reality situation complex fact allow government regulate speech broadcast regulations suppress right free speech letting fcc operate illegally american people giving right think freely decided decent eventually even rights erode governmental agencies become powerful recently vote congress potentially allowing fcc
