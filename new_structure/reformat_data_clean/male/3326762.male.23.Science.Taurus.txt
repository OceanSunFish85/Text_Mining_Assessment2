sprint right outer lane street sidewalk carrying brief case someone goods maybe protecting police maybe one thieves knows oh wanted flee place emergency clip tourists allowed panic stay calm buy shit talk merchant let give gibberish directions hooligans pick pockets hire taxi eventually settled original subway station taken hell district made amazingly simple transfers necessary meet friend brooklyn reasoning faculties shot point even feel bad clairvoyance make decision earlier consumed overstressing repetition unsavory throngs hell might easily left things simple narrative regurgitation events justice non linear distortion reality really felt like part dream especially true since remember bits pieces like fragments dream think upon writing might actually stumbled upon nyc really must abstract fashion defies tour books magazine write ups surely inaccessible statue liberty stands like broken memory america indeed passed one allowed inside statue anymore opinion signifies terrible malady state country living obviously disease power moment unable understand confront realistically therefore majesty limits oh scores helicopters patrolling waters like kind derelict prison state rant rate finally met buddy got lunch tremendous relief finally give responsibility finding way around bit time gather little sympathy awe friend events befallen point really begun first call friend
