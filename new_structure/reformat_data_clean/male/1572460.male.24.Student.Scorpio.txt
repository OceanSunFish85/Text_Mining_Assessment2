spotted mom dad waved exactly true spotted mostly csu shirt according especially mom almost unrecognizable ofcourse attributed thought unimaginable weight loss although true even aware fact looked shockingly different old self left usa months ago since parents first people seeing long gap obviously alarmed physical condition frank guess looked pathetic completely worn recall friends csu saying looked much leaner late reaction really serious parents understandably since parents met span months noticed change easily friends used seeing everyday pushed pune thrilled back homeland completely unaware fact would rude shock coming new year would like add something dad revealed later diagnosed dad type ii diabetic last decade technicalities diabetes later well experienced sense something wrong hour two met terminal car way pune one conscious fact drank two big bottles water almost litres space hour drinking water proportions unusual person perhaps true people extreme cases sportspersons constantly consume fluids keep hydrated dad fear might diabetes grew even weight loss backed unquenchable thirst dry mouth syndrome kept mum feelings time must hoped eventually would wrong decemberthe first couple days decemberwere pretty busy meeting family friends answering phone calls catching well deserved rest sleep time apparent weight loss worn looks become focal point conversation anybody met person spite fact issue grabbed much attention others around still absolutely unprepared store day later shrugged issue times truth matter lost whopping pounds within last months precisely starting june whatever analysis comparison could draw photographs june june fundamental explanation happened another fact hard noticed us frequent runs bathroom made something find surprising least bothered last months like two symptoms thirst weight loss completely ignorant fact urinated every hour sure case every day since june past three months fall semester recall waking thrice night regularly urinate drinking bottles bottles water urinating became routine thing even remember laugh two friends worse even joked might diabetes diabetes runs family aware symptoms associated ignorance bliss motto since felt perfectly fit otherwise even care discuss things parents phone kept telling never felt better ever whole life alright reality pancreas losing fight inside body months note plan discuss gory details diabetes next chapters forgive things seem unclear point beta cells islet cells also called islets langerhans named paul langerhans discovered produce hormone insulin pancreas battling survive body immune system merriam webster defines immune system bodily system protects body foreign substances cells tissues producing immune response short immune system normally battles keep us alive healthy instead gradually destroying wiping islet cells produce insulin hormone essential converting sugar carbohydrates starches food energy metabolism needed daily life american diabetes association ada describes insulin hormone unlocks cells body allowing glucose enter fuel victim classic symptoms insulin dependent diabetes mellitus meanwhile dad fear grew concern impatience suggested check blood glucose levels using glucometer go see family doctor glucometer device used measure person blood glucose levels dad used check sugars glucometers still well prevalent india cousin milind brought one dad us years ago extremely convenient device days smart blood glucose monitoring system check one blood sugars home without visit laboratories submit blood samples anxiously wait results glucometers give results within seconds moreover compromise accuracy glucometers later thing turns people see glucometer idea pricking fingers blood sample actually much better option getting blood sample using painful needle syringe since lancing devices use thin needle prick lance call important person use independently without somebody else drawing blood particular glucometer pretty obsolete current standards fairly thick needle compared one use present since seen dad regularly using intentions making fuss pricking seriousness symptoms starting bother thought getting everything really big deal thought perhaps idea would atleast times day coming months maybe rest life must say get painful times painful extremely frustrating pricked drew blood sample tip finger utmost difficulty case cold fingers guess dabbed onto meter test strip inserted strip device remember clearly mom dad staring glucometer almostseconds seemed like lifetime could sense tension air dismay glucometer showed error tried using another blood sample using different test strip result however consulted glucometer manual concluded reason error nothing blood sugar level high glucometer went range although failed get exact blood sugar reading pretty much confirmed unofficial diabetic took really understand happening short span time nobody spoke rest evening night time spent long discussions family thing left part visit family doctor get confirmed official diagnosis still feeling would proved wrong case would turn something called pre diabetes temporary high blood sugar levels brought normal ready accept fact might go medication days things would back normal decemberearly morning dad set visit dr anand gokhale family doctor past odd years nulkars dr gokhale someone doctor mere mention name nulkar household enough us rid sickness world two standard blood tests generally carried test diabetes fasting plasma glucose fasting plasma glucose test preferred way diagnose diabetes requires atleast hours overnight fasting single blood sample drawn doctor clinic sent laboratory results normal fasting plasma glucose levels milligrams per deciliter mg dl ii oral glucose tolerance test gtt test performed fasting plasma glucose test given grams glucose sweet tasting liquid water one blood samples taken two three hours test morning test person eat smoke drink coffee tea fairly healthy condition cold flu oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels several times period ofhours person without diabetes glucose levels rise fall quickly someone diabetes glucose levels rise higher normal fail come back fast person said normal response hour glucose level less mg dl values hours less mg dl case one single blood sample taken hours gtt time left home ati utterly famished incidentally another common symptom type patient increased hunger experience uncontrollable hunger times reach alarming proportions like symptoms supposed know test results evening could hardly wait evening dr gokhale bad news results came shocker everyone including dr gokhale fasting plasma glucose gtt way higher anybody expected explained glucometer conked previous day definitely atleast doubting fact developed chronic diabetes classic case hyperglycemia technical term high blood sugar although prepared worst took time sink news actually hit things happened fairly quickly last couple days impossible fathom exactly gone wrong tried think piece together information like patient newly diagnosed disease sickness dumbfounded spite tremendous research diabetes causes symptoms treatment doctors still unable confirm whether diagnosis type type ii initial results unless person suffers many serious complications case definite conclusions immediately drawn going details types diabetes later chapters simply put type patient insulin dependent e needs insulin externally shots pump order survive whereas type ii patient treated taking oral pills control blood sugar since insulin treatment considered intensive initial risk factors dr gokhale decided begin short day treatment prescribing oral pills days follow pills worked controlling sugar normal levels would essentially fall category diabetics type ii patients eventually would learn pills absolutely effect controlling blood sugar januaryon january exactly days went oral pills officially diagnosed type patient based blood sugar tests done glucometer following exact readings got three days prior confirmation insulin dependent diabetic january random test january fasting plasma glucose january post breakfast hours breakfast january post prandial hours post lunch results showed pills nothing achieve sort control even slightest improvements condition reason pills work presence insulin body even small amount fact pills failed proof enough pancreas produced insulin extremely insignificant amounts insulin pills could use meanwhile underwent several tests check diabetes caused physical complications important simply prolonged high sugars gone un noticed may result life threatening long term complications essential undergo medical examination history indicated diabetes actually months old assuming period began suffering symptoms hence exam became even important tests fortunately turned normal namely sonography pancreas ecg electric cardio gram test detection diagnosis heart abnormalities measures electrical potentials body surface generates record electrical currents associated heart muscle activity kidney urine tests whole lot others understood medical technicians doctors however close call two tests case borderline slightly normal mark thyroid test luckily alarming eye check dr sachin kale clinic found spherical distance right eye increased fromtoand left eye distance gone fromtoeven though fundus part eye opposite pupil normal stage wherein another months high sugar could resulted possible retinal damage common diabetes complication older patients time fortunate left clinic nothing slightly thicker pair glass lenses sense look back think extremely lucky got diagnosed right time cannot imagine physical complications would experienced condition gone un noticed usa e planned india trip january creepiest thought immediately came mind slowly began learn diabetes complications condition called diabetic ketoacidosis ketones acids toxins build blood produced blood glucose rises absence insulin large amounts ketones blood cause life threatening problem called diabetic ketoacidosis dka dka medical emergency serious condition lead diabetic coma passing long time even death know person sugar levels one point found difficult even recognize people ketoacidosis may happen people type diabetes ketones poison body warning sign diabetes control ketones mean body burning fat get energy urine tests indicate ketones could beginning losing weight even though eating much normal essentially burning fat moderate large amounts ketones urine dangerous upset chemical balance blood ketoacidosis usually develops slowly vomiting occurs continuously may turn serious matter hours symptoms generally increased thirst dry mouth frequent urination tiredness dry flushed skin nausea vomiting abdominal stomach pains hard time breathing paying attention utter confusion already experiencing half symptoms also realized harsh winter usa added dry skin problem even though never bothered tiredness remember hard time concentrating classes times even dozed occasions end managed perform well though moreover still bewildered considered fit fiddle even
