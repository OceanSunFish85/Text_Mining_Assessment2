another echo echo everywhere go something really need everyone know someone want even though really know better pick let slip away better stick take another day mouth everything say fades echo echo come go woah want another echo echo open eyes clouds break feel light even though world shakes every night quiet satellite hold close focus everything know even know falls hear echo echo come go woah want another echo echo hear hear cause need reach hear coming clearly hollow echo echo echo come go woah want another echo echo echo echo come go woah want another echo echo shackled long life sewn tight inside hold leaves without place call know shadows see point running less run half distance open door cut let introduce end feel cold wind blowing beneath wings always leads back suffering soar wind whips leaves beaten unholy ground tired paying dues start strong always lose half distance leave behind waste time chorus cause shackles rapture believe deep inside bleed slave inside broken dream forever holding splitting seams take piece leave alone die need keep faith alive know trouble follows easily half distance open door shut let introduce end chorus though know care chorus laughter hear faster disappear time burn eyes tears
