thought human eye really detect motion takes lots snapshots fairly quicklytimes second hertz brain puts together allowing brain percieve motion motion still different places quickly get meaning p whose say apply universe brain aarent perception motion h lemme get point thinking might possible whole universe operates refresh rate ala crt screens tv etc incredibly fast high probably hopefully impossible detect first stumbled across thought figured might explain speed light faster get explanation elaborate idea universal refresh rate slow time fact stop completely everything stands still yes alright go forward time little possibleseconds forward base time two updates relating refresh rate idea whatever assuming theory reasonable could interval would infinitely small maybe haard explain moved forward happened everything changed state whole universe minutely definitely changed moved move however popped forward little like looking consecutive frames movie reel point either onto idea speed light thought fully yet hear light moved infinite speed detectable moved infinite distance consecutive frame universe refresh rate one would actually see light already passed erf think lost plot bit onwards seems movement displacement changing states whatever takes place frames occurence frame limiting effect light travel gap frames thus making detectable visible bear mind throughout whole explanation assume anything universe percieve frame update time space update us would seem like thing refresh rate aside fact happening quickly seems like fluid motion life occuring cant detect refresh rate really case however say huge amount time frame would wiser percieve anything happening updates anyway wierd way sort rationalise whole idea wonder actually use besides probably lots ideas theories poke holes read destroy theory hehe okay seeing huge audience unleaded
