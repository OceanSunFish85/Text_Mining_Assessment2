facing white giant wow ok want first thing said climbed miserable treacherous monster remember worse experience life cotopaxi serious climb serious climbers small percentage attempt reach summit make turn back due lack physical ability altitude sickness weather glacier capped volcano reachesfeet bulge equator actually furthest point center earth closest point earth sun real deal comparing everest whose peak somewhere abovefeet base camp alone higher cotopaxi summit get idea basically match one terrifying movies morons try climb everest k2 face worst conditions imaginable basically experience alright right moron much worse ones everest movies cotopaxi big dangerous mountain one goes without guide unless serious mountaineering experience even attempt summit mountaineers know ever even happened someone shows base camp alone experience knowledge trail even know put rented crampons take back happened saturday june done lot reading talked many people read reports people climbed cotopaxi seemed though case difficult climb recommended essentially required either experienced guide extensive experience however technical possible summit without guide climbing partners well obviously experience guides cost p chance research found could rent gear refuge base camp costs hired pickup heading way take guided idiots paying mere round trip found going hitch park entrance hope ride remote base camp assume someone else mind taking home reached top yeah worked set set arrived guided group climbers base figured told group rode meeting professional guide top endure questioning along lines crazy think figuring awesome shape well acclimated definitely got physical requirements seen pictures young american tourist chicks hard could weekend definitely climbers setting tackle summit equipment ability need direction simply follow guided groups summit sure might little slow able challenge time records like hit summit time sunrise watch great golden fireball appear curve earth e yeah set base camp experience pretty standard arriving noon waiting six seven clock getting rest theam wake call chumps paid top dollar afternoon learning use equipment practicing safety techniques hell hard could dinner atin bed byand one really sure purpose really friendly seem lot questions seems times might overestimate unless stupid consider possibilities anyways first snag perfect plan arises altitude sickness comes keeps night outside toilet taking note terrible weather seems coming one minute sleep gear wait outside first group begin attempt snowed night dumping mixture snow freezing rain us temperatures zero dark night bundled expedition like excess follow first group three across mars like terrain pay attention reached base glacier minutes stopped put equipment tied one another guide questions intentions disbelief alone warns ignore warning makes clear hold responsibility even want show way hurries trying lose successful fact started behind first group figuring could follow headlamps whole way one first summit damn good thing ran problems found losing sight group ahead certainly waiting thus would need wait next group follow passed follow headlamps seven groups counted base started behind first finished behind last group already turned back passing shocked furious alone dark ropes guide trying lose responsibility might save life quickly possible experience sick hell uncomfortable saying go bathroom entire time hours felt like going explode inside unfortunately stop would lose sight headlamps following conditions absolutely dreadful wailing winds frozen ice snow sticking like feathers tar unstable ice making lack experience crampons much dangerous worst security tied anyone one slip crampons sends darkness side enormous glacier forever go back know way stop wait groups start coming back freeze death keep moving face glacier atfeet alone unsecured inexperienced sick death altitude could barely breathe points push trying follow headlamps thoughts kept running mind absolutely miserable worst experience life never afraid felt closer death one wrong step losing sight headlamps ahead ensures fate oblivion glacier would give anything go bathroom god stupid experience scared life like never done pretty adventurous things miserable praying moment back base camp safe sound even care finishing climb reaching summit seeing sunrise curve earth etc would pride accomplishing feat point merely survival choice plugged following passing group great fortune would headlamp batteries die follow two groups start crevasse large crack ice could fall never recovered stop change batteries minutes took six disappeared saw headlamps coming behind certain least really hopeful one group wait ended passing ice minutes last group arrived cross woken daylight starting show promise followed hour shy summit first groups started coming following last make would least minutes wanted badly call quits follow first group forgetting summit plugged early morning dusk missing sunrise miserably arriving summit carrying least pounds ice stuck making look like stay puff marshmallow man clouds never cleared see meters ahead incredibly unrewarded accomplishment prize glorious views top left without taking single picture really option anyways considering entire one frozen block ice started way without waiting folks followed made record time another rule summiting afoot glacier capped active volcano alone without experience safety rule descending peak glacade glacading sliding face glacier uncontrollably butt makes descent fraction time requires energy problem could clearly slide right path abyss ice die well enough damned volcano figured hell one rule made cold miserable unrewarded depressed exhausted angry actually energy feelings kind made back base camp met others sipping tea make summit backed first couple hours unfortunately still leading pack behind first group otherwise would joined simply grunted commented much harder thought sick gotten shame view top summated well barely made onto glacier seemed exhausted surprised overall rewarded least gave shot one even mentioned fact cost hah
