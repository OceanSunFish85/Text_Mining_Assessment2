mayamsterdam schiphol int l airport near lockers incase ever get chance choose going break relative pros cons st louis lambert detroit mcnamara amsterdam schiphol international airports lucky enough never flown st louis stl clear loser three several reasons anti hometown bias part first nothing cool dad pointed thing eat sausages wants sausages exactly true stl really offer knock fast food restaurants manned real go getters er people look like want something secondly designers stl decided go soul vibe feel introducing lovely purple orange color scheme coupled nothing else except giant stains floor stl really terrible mean planes land take however would think would something beyond detroit amsterdam seem locked fierce battle number one pros cons different like indian jungle cobra facing archnemesis wily mongoose detroit interesting feature shape certain airports use geometric theme compliment futuristic modernistic idea traveling via air rather stagecoach charles de gaulle worst airport ever later uses circles instance detroit unique really even use shape tell memory serves correctly gradeschool geometry definite line definite lines straight connect two points infinite lines go forever direction detroit airport gigantic strip frickin gates rather horseshoe shape anything like giant straight line inspiration must swine trough forgiven however fact giant quiet monorail constantly goes one end stopping also middle ingeniously travel entire airport mins suddenly straight line theorem airport design gains significant weight best part monorail simple last year use hare train system required matching letter gate number subdivided color codes yellow blue red green great hour layover like right hustling side airport larger samantha harvey hometown detroit ford gm shirt stores chili various sports bars etc nothing crazy functional section new clean unlike rest detroit actually saw guy wearing shirt said tought vacation detroit sweet eh amsterdam hour half airport hence referred ams seem several sweet things place going first internet cafe get mins online time view good deal considering airports usually inflate prices see previous post one detroit twice much amount time secondly another convenience scattered throughout terminal special seating areas chairs shaped contoured like lounge recliner comfortable could actually fall asleep felt like detroit hand arm rests every row seat makes laying impossible ams also gets bonus points culture newspapers books different languages unlike detroit international secondly mini museum free right neat sketches exotic animals done 1700s dutch naturalists interesting see one sketcher first time saw ghastly beast indian elephant amazed could walk considering weird toes look also exagerrated sharp tusks cool something worthwhile ams also ranks duty free stores detroit df prices equal q mart cahokia illinois ams glenlivet cost like spoke mihai mike american sf told best thing ams long layovers buy bunch

caught flight stl caught flight detroit sleep start work soon think business professionals professional get everything done hours well sleep optional within reason seems lot feasible actually feel tired phase relaxed concentration secondly got lot good books rather read yeah anyway blah argh shizznits think right going give ams spot may change grades incomplete plane leaves runway mentioned charles de gaulle paries worst ask cdg absolutely horrible anyone ever flown tell even talking poor people died part terminal collapsed weeks ago cdg weird modernistic piece crap financed bloated french welfare state attempt wow visitors similarly eiffel tower looks neat blueprints relatively useless space cdg made cirlces main terminal giant circle middle smaller circles planes dock land circle get c direct route instead go outside wait bus drives way around airport taking like mins understand thing old convenient system could easily built circle design probably prevents secondly absolutely nothing bookstores typically nothing english anything spanish french got downtown paris understand reprinting things english french like culture fine cool talking international airport perople outside france fly words people french probably therefore speak french closest analogy think women clothing store carry tops pants pants weird capri pants flare fringe jeans normal length skirts etc goofy capri pants make sense goofy capri pants french articles clothing international travelers look prententious steel glass architecture hours duty free stores cdg nothing except small cafes get dare say crepes would followed mihai plan cdg made beam cokes instead seats also uncomfortable bad rash reliving 6th grade thinking long commute thinking like travel europe much think answer
