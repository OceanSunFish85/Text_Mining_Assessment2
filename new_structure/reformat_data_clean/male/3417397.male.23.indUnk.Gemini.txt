remember sitting lake relaxing like tomorrow would never open eyes never take day away memories swimming dreams leaving shadows love lost wishing day would shine brighter remember leaving things way sun hitting window reflecting mirror shinging eye looked like heaven remember many nights alone calling happiness sunsets holding hands park first kiss much bliss remember leaving things way back night sitting sun setting behind shades darker blue moving way heart much change moving wind something light dark
