last week talked possibilities allowed modern technology area creation local jurisdictions provinces states direct vote week shall talk possibilities modern technology presents determination representation popular branch legislature simply put computers implement complex vote counting schemes possibility enfranchising many groups people technically disenfranchised current geographical mode representation effectively disenfranchised due lack geographical cohesion government currently structured along lines structured two hundred years ago even invention telegraph community synonymous geographical areas inhabited people upper classes might identified closely peers next community immediate neighbors already influential interests probably represented time direct representation geographical communities perfectly adequate mode representation would overkill certainly complex scheme present would costly time consuming extreme level technology level technology rise instant communications particularly internet possibility current reality might called cyber communities mean groups people sense community might arise perhaps desiring representation body fully deserving representation individuals group however scattered throughout country rather traditional local community even group becomes large enough national scale respectable plurality lack local majority one place ensures never directly represented specific issues feel strongly group might able fold one major political parties hardly guaranteed hardly point fought war independence issue virtual representation two hundred years ago communities need direct representation recent experience demonstrates communities necessarily geographically defined remember basic political science correctly u k system representation done along party lines rather provincial lines similar suggest still simplistic compared system would like propose system works follows reads bit like computer code natural language everybody starts single vote object presence program adjudicates election place votes whatever individual trust smart legislating governing least voting someone else job program goes individual sends vote along person voted point certain people one vote name program rearranges list citizens votes least point program performs following actions record sequentially votes least first checks voter current number votes equal recent non zero value marks record locked preventing sending votes one voted done prevent infinite loops vote counts checks see citizen enough votes gain seat legislature people enough votes gain seat least vote body legislators person marked legislator wins seat number votes required gain seat subtracted total remaining votes even win sent whomever voted person voted unlocked allow votes flow onward system moves next one list performing series actions every record perhaps save processing time non zero vote records program reaches end list sorts according number votes continues either votes absorbed representatives records list either zero locked prevent infinite loops happens remaining seats filled people top list however many necessary reach number representatives specified individuals selected notified everything else procedure one detail votes passed around time simply numbers carry identity voter originally cast reaches point winner absorbs encrypted email sent voter informing vote ultimately elected point identity person voted destroyed candidate get know elected secret ballot remains place voter gets know vote ultimately elected number ways could see mode voting used first parties using consolidate numbers nationally exact manner parties could national scale representing partisan interests local scale representing regional interests second people pay whole lot attention politics understand importance know someone else pay attention might know better vote one problem system government reflect way many people actually politics country nomination process bit free final vote ultimately results complete elimination one group voice problem two major parties even lose one state sure gain another problem anyone else muster majority one state minority views squelched two major parties present difficult choice one views straddle party line take situation economic liberty republican platform typically however deeply concerned creeping religious fundamentalism suspect many republicans would institute christian theocracy particular variety christianity say chance republicans given chance would give rights small set wealthy corporations individuals also concerned environment typically democratic platform however also think times many democrats given chance would go liberty crushing extremes engineer perfect society despite lessons learned soviet union sure others share set views indeed continual rush center two parties proves majority swing voters straddle party lines ultimate result large number representatives know loyalties lie times centrists feel indebted extremes right left things keep losing votes others might partisans try keep centrist face stay office sneak highly partisan measure get away one help dishonest sneaky system like way survive faces one present likely one elected extremely unjust situation imagine follows suppose situation two parties typically majority given state suppose third party typically able get third vote states real situation mathematical hypothetical means every state either party party least vote state major party vote third party stable vote states despite stable strong showing absolutely representation government even fold views party still matter state dominant party already winning smallest party majority states win help course real life would rarely work like disconnecting votes local areas allowing people similar ideologies consolidate votes would allow people ultimately elected honestly represent people actually identify rather constantly play polling guessing game typically goes however another group people typically represented non political people people typically vote pretty sure us fit category one way another example tend vote statewide elections simply lack readily available information candidates issues discuss actual activities state legislature one practically expert researcher know anything state politics california vote presidential election though major candidates usually disgust end voting third party candidate generally vote senatorial election one avoid information elections typically know nothing voter pamphlet tells state local elections know alone voter turnout statistics prove addition uncomfortable information acquire since skewed ultimately favor large powerful media organizations instead research entire system would quite chore california even elect county head fireman could simply research one close home area local politics say city council discover area trust make right decisions perhaps local political organization know certain people know system directly people could literally vote whomever want know indirect way vote actually count one way allow people simply ask knowledgeable people voting advice two problems first removes secrecy ballot individual least knows asker likely voted makes many people uncomfortable problem country reaches certain size three layers community consider current solution problem giant media bonanza ultimately results elections dominated people money buy best television ads really know senatorial candidates let alone president people know nothing tv tells system propose would allow people vote people personally acquainted thus would likely know allow people vote people acquainted ladder finally reaches national level would take day television campaigns would still significant effect candidates would also worry private face since people close might enough quiet influence decide election could work particularly well emerging democracies countries general populace rightfully distrusts national media people stay home choice vote famous guy know little nobody could vote village elder local hero something person may enough support represent whole country interests likely know someone bit closer goal would election based upon money television upon rising pyramid trust representation local interests answer typically bicameral legislatures let one house represent national interests continue elected regional basis defend local interest ravages ideology unleashed second option shall leave next week ramble
