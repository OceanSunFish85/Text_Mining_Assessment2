today talked walkie talkie alone find anyone talk world left alone sighing began rain feel lonely desperation hits hard time need hide feeling nobody listen feel sad talked walkie talkie words thoughts feelings unhappiness sadness sent radio signal sent unknown places maybe sent thin air hear guess gone thin air matter long talked walkie talkie forever dumb listen never understand talked myseld much hear understand hope yes know another rainy day hold tears shed stand rain nobody see crying hear said hope
