yes totally right agree almost everything said obviously long anyone alive living life life experience experience found every waking moment think said personally find fulfilling life activities painting writing etc find activities like watching tv playing board games fulfilling ideas head meaningful life whatever means midst absurdity enjoyment pleasure get act thinking stuff satisfying ground projects set life like becoming writer wanting understand reality e philosophize certain specific activities particular finds distinctly enjoyable e fulfilling wrong generalize personal feelings personal life applied life general everybody example would find philosophy fulfilling fact ascribing value system people general values place activities simply think everyone philosophy things general everyone pursued activities would make boring society like said phone last night life found variety experience experience certain variety directed responses explore specific issues distinction puts activities two completely separate different opposing categories right believe overly dramatic distinction living life activities waiting die activities think exists distinction find fulfilling activities find fulfilling activities purely subjective personal part thus believe generalized everybody selves different find fulfilling interests would like point though given subjectivity would believe find fulfilling activities living life activities vice versa participating find fulfilling activities sometimes start feel like waiting die hear saying activities valuable experiences provide us life playing board games allows social interactions beyond board game proper watching tv sometimes desirable beyond ground projects like writing etc right spent time writing would feel equally unfulfilled fact writing would become incredibly boring due lack anecdotal experience upon could draw material needs balance variety important sometimes indeed need watch television vedge activities necessarily directly contribute ground projects fulfilling experiences enjoyment find experiences relative experiences one lesser something different kinds ways living life contrast define kinds ways saying us certain activities find fulfilling others faced others may necessarily always enjoy find fulfilling even though experiences living life good may always feel good want force something enjoy think experiences good think experiences positive value believe experiences equal amount value believe distribution value something set personally others may different distributions may put watching tv higher priority wasting time typing nonsense computer one experiences uses value whatever using means whatever way able measure value think something subconscious e feel know rather conscious status report value distributions varying levels satisfaction may necessarily want enjoy continuing experience circumstance may even feel like enjoying living life let qualify feeling little severe probably sounding experiences believe wide range combined values one time instance watching tv may loose interest tv proper still enjoying conversations friends hugging girl friend eating food relaxing brain mean watching tv watching tv involves bunch activities may value well rare occasions may get tired associated activities want pursue satisfying fulfilling activity saying loud enough watching tv may fact mean enough watching tv associated activities think anything wrong though trying devalue particular activity particular like express particular activities particular people particularly less valuable walking forest heading along cleared path walk already pre determined somebody else trees scenery see around already chosen people created path interacting friends learning growing different way right great analogy comparison examples yeah guess everything less related somebody else already done e designed people experience mean even looking piece artwork experiencing designed life concerned individual design life individual free choices see also choose design designed life sometimes may want experience looking painting designed another person free choices live second order experience thing choose experience take ownership becomes first order experience ever existed could possibly looking painting time day angle sorts thoughts experience life chosen live way right similarly could choose watch tv play cards surf internet chosen constrained activities still free activity value found game social interaction game allows things beyond even social interaction social interaction reason enjoy activities although may aspect activity particular find greater value might things like element chance mystery card game rush adrenaline betting uncertainty motivation win interaction friends breaking ice game provides opening conversations people mental occupation entertainment provides etc things together relatedly constitute whatever value activity things important different people think also variety life basically trying say convoluted kind way everyone differs interpretation fulfilling kinds activities find meaningful enough pursue yes everybody different right tried project values world activity make sense determines value activity totally subjective relative person experiencing activity certainly believe absolute category fulfilling meaningful ie living life vs less fulfilling meaningless ie waiting die agree absolute category fulfilling meaningful believe subjective individual something fulfilling meaningful whatever subjective range value naturally map onto everyone else values world interesting question ask given range differing values sort normative correlation know would interesting consistently values valued others mean ultimately value assignment meaningless absurd reality anything goes whatever values exist exist human minds put rock care placed pillow smashed billion pieces human might us human beings maybe share certain ranged similarity value judgments us agree killing bad thing us lot people think gay marriage ok people conservative liberal one way thinking necessarily right groups people think similarly similar value assignments activities reality saying given vast possibility differences subjective worth interesting note many us actually share similar values total tangent main issue thinklet brain fart real found everything individual watching television walking woods playing board game painting picture beyond limiting really living well agree life real indeed found everything experienced life sure limiting experiences necessarily bad thing either mean certain activity choose pursue one place higher value upon limiting experiencing activity list diverse less valuable fulfilling activities think necessarily hurting agree may missing something valuable cannot think agree necessarily missing way think proceed acknowledge circumstances great number value floating around cannot conscious finite beings anyway gods given make judgment activity valuable us simply know also know certain activities valuable us also sluff activities favour possibly valuable activities balance think give opportunity possible balance absolute possible unknown possibly find newer better value absolute find already know eventually get bored find less less valuable meantime certainty value question radical liberal experimenter safe conservative nobody one absolutely somewhere inbetween two absolutes least think far ok enough phew
