time really fly blink eye seems cry time say goodbye know feels like deep inside tell smile tell heart opposite smiles little things stuffs let hear little things want tell ears please hold tears afraid thanks part says cries takes little stars dreams little shines made smile done lot shall say cured little wounds still wet inside partially dried thank less say everything takes little poems show gratitude sorry shall say times may much usual may hurt know might kept quiet silence brought mystery hope find nisa
