woke suddenly midst nite due unknown fear darkness around dark dark enough hope ray light eyes wide open struggling hard see vain darkness deep piercing soul making feel like crying calling loud help vain seemed like screams cries somehow lost jingle opened mouth vocals failed somehow tears made way silently moistening face adding vulnerability gloomy mysterious winds gave sickening feeling soaked perspiration fear gradually creeping soul making feel entangled web darkness lightly tightly woven around locks darkness tightly woven life breathing living feeling caught helplessly guard wanted come get things got worst even slight move strands tightened around hurting badly making cry depth darkness deep enough absorb vails cries beam light nowhere darkness taken glow shine hope lightening life felt miserable suddenly realization struck therz always light behind every dark nite definitely somehow someday shadows dark taken brightness joy life offer day strands b let loose give freedom breath radiate smiles happiness contentment realization led new dimensions life even blackness mid nite could c far distant sun rising eat shades dark sky announcing better tomorrow bringing smile satisfaction lips closed eyes instant lost valley sweet dreams
