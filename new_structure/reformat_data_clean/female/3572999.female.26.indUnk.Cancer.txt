angel walked earth today reigning joy everyone dazzling smile like bright summers day blinding glory love life bubbling like freshly poured champagne angel walked earth today beauty possessed heart gold hair silk hearts surely touched brief visit may wish could stayed longer didnt leave like delicate shinning star faded dark night sky angel returned home sleeps blessed pain tears rest well little angel meet written lylia garrett july
