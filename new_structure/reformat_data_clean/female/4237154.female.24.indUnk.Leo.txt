purpose howto describe methodology managing multiple operating systems single computer system intended linux users basic familiarity linux lilo installations nothing terribly complex however considering amount time takes install operating systems relatively time consuming different methods require multiple operating systems boot disk instead uses fixed internal disk containing single primary operating system selection removable disks one operating systems installed absolutely two three four different operating systems single disk trying get behave howto specific goals primary operational disk configured installed rarely changed includes repartition otherwise modify disk resides easy selection multiple alternative operating systems boot time without go one two menu

widely accepted us still need access operating systems use linux time still need access win 9x applications found acceptable alternatives linux wife uses ms office work wants access home people want access alternative fun training keep current job tend treat new would game actually anything productive installing learning control challenging interesting quake simcity computer scientist keeps current evolving technology helped solve multitude problems work rate new linux users computer professionals trying migrate one operating system another believe using multiple operating systems norm rather exception system requirements bios bios allows automatic identification disk drive geometry allows select sequence devices boot work successfully built systems based phoenixbiosand ami plug play flash bios disks one fixed internal disk dedicated linux first disk one removable drive enclosure number drives second disk since lot howto disks generally use terms first disk second disk first disk one initially accessed machine turned commonly known boot disk lilo installed mbr dedicated single operating system specifically linux second disk removable disk contains one alternative operating systems may may boot loader mbr elsewhere hardware firmware requirements requirements would dictated specific instance even though could install solaris going run well old 90mhz machine configuration methodology described however work equally well regardless cpu speed installed peripherals operating systems tested process linux redhat suse solaris beos win even msdosi see reason work win freebsd familiar windows nt know would react kind setup boot loader used lilo first disk beos bootman second disks used lilo first disk boot loader allowed select mbr second disk managing multiple

machine presented lilo prompt pressing linux disk2 options linux default would automatically boot nothing selected disk2 either boots directly single stored second disk presents second boot menu one disk power replace second disk another power back still get initial linux disk menu select disk2 new menu appropriate newly inserted disk installed never modify lilo configuration first disk never change bios setting boot second disk never go two menu selections get selected running installation three distinct parts installation first building primary dedicated drive second building second disk whatever alternative selected finally reconfiguring bios lilo support disksinstalling primary operating system installation primary operational fairly straight forward treat system single drive system dedicated linux refer documentation came distribution see details installing linux ultimately multiple disk installation steps need taken trick install routines thinking installation process single

installed also install everything appropriate single disk system asked tell install program use entire disk operating system accepted default redhat partitioning installed generic lilo mbr installation complete shutdown reboot confirm system works properly managing multiple operating systems howto works scenario point fully functional machine boots directly linuxinstalling alternative operating systems fully functional system move building second disk alternative operating systems select operating system two installation second disk decided good reason windows beos initial test case partitioned 8gb drive two 4gb primary partitions installed windows first partition beos second things install first disable first disk bios installer even see important physically remove disconnect first disk protect primary system errors part overly greedy operating systems want take disks see second installation time future decide create another removable disk make sure repeat step done install chosen operating systems installing single drive system installing one operating system second disk plug installation disk let thing windows operating system including second linux install fine way allow windows 9x write mbr installing linux select mbr location install lilo decided install two operating systems second disk could confirm functionality cascading boot loaders first installed windows automatically overwrites mbr would overwritten boot loader code eventually placed next installed beos second partition ran bootman beos boot loader built boot menu second disk intentionally overwrote windows mbr bootman essential could used mbr based boot loader available works quite reboot frequently make sure everything works properly single disk system rebooted
