thought everything represented everything gave thinking answers moved finally found happiness doesnt include met thought nothing everything showed way gave hand hold climbed long journey putting trust afraid move forward someone else longer blame longer hold past regrets realized mistake placing blame one creating problems ok left memories began new journey whisper final words last chapter goodbye
