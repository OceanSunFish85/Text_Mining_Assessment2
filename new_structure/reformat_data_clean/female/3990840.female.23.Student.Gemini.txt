yeah dork hey think interesting maybe today topic star formation basically stars form particles space dust get close enough gravitational attraction hook together greater mass atom attract particles continues huge mass particles gas brought together gravitational forces gravity makes particles get closer closer together heats eventually get hot enough bump eachother get fusion two protons smack together stick forming helium energy made fusion pushes counteracting gravitational force creating stable star size fusion never accomplished get brown dwarf usually happens total mass less times mass sun eventually core star runs hydrogen atoms full helium atoms produced fusion hydrogen point enough energy produced core counteract gravitational forces star begins collapse star collapse electrons forced space time pauli exclusion principle get electron degeneracy pressure pushing counteracting gravity star contracts core heats even point helium begin fusion star called red giant eventually helium like hydrogen used contraction begin carbon core formed helium fusion compressed rebounds pushes away outer envelope gas becomes planetary nebula point fusion core stopped gradually cools becoming white dwarf roughly size earth density ton cm really cool thing jupiter two three times current mass would evolved star would double star system means jupiter basically brown dwarf star never enough mass fusion lesson day interesting right
