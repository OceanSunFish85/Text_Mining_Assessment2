every time feel like crying gonna try make laugh hurts bad wait pass keep company days long black keep working problem know never solve love uneven remainders lives fractions whole world could remain within frame like painting wall think see beauty stand staring awe bright eyes might go bread co tomorrow might go summer school summer fail ever try heart
