current assignment research mechanisms pleisiosaur holds breath long time pre historic deep sea dives well ive come thoughts subject thoughts mainly turtles hear say pleisiosaur turtle may case consider similar body structure environment definitely related leatherback turtles deepest diving turtles sea ingenious ways holding breath basic background cells need oxygen nutrients survive grow regenerate nutrients come food eat case pleisiosaur leatherback comes fish eat oxygen comes air breathe comes paradox cells need constant supply oxygen keep alive hence catch fish one catch fish underwater air breathe one utilise oxygen single breath air lung keep cells oxygenated long time firstly got lungs course deeper dive higher water pressure body hence lungs cant keep lungs inflated collapse immense pressure sea leatherback turtle achieves balance pressures pushing air lungs non respiratory parts respiratory system e parts arent involved gas exchange processes namely bronchii secondly got heart parallels hibernation occur deep dive heart rate leatherback decreases dramatically around beat per seconds could wrong rate time find heart rate decreases rate breathing consider could somehow slow heart rate beat per seconds could stay underwater minutes heartbeats taking deep breath holding taking pulse quite obvious hold beats counted beats seconds slow heart rate beat per seconds would able hold breath minutes would extremely useful ability travelling say sydney many parts paris theres something heart baroreceptors bunch nerves around aorta detect pressures adjust heart rate accordingly elaborate bit later ive researched mechanisms bit thirdly got haemoglobin baby leatherbacks highest amount haemoglobin myoglobin reptile means alot us inefficient humans twice blood oxygen carrying capacity every turtle oxygen carry less breathing time spend deep blue chasing fishies thats
