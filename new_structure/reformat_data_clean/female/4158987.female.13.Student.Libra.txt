love word ponderings break get pond like lake eh like oh ring like disaster wedding rings tend end disaster pondering like dipping lake disaster maybe shut eyes able feel waves washing hear delicate ripples leaves fall pond breathe air immortality philosophers stone soluble tablet lake disaster solution like chemistry dreamt night cold dark lake watching world rippled mirror saw peering white hand slooshing water slooshing view finally clear star lit lake middle star spread crucifix shape eyes blazing hair fanning like underwater reached feel wetness hair felt heat star plunged icy water melted oblivion love random dreams
