favorite lyrics time bye poison well please read slowly carefully take em let know feel em describes much kisses never safe residue old love left could feel lesser someone better walks around waiting call cold hand grasps mine feel unright privileged able look eyes chemical stars deformed fingers leave trails hearts writing could three words end births meaning crying sleep remedy urgently trying stand broken confused legs looking reasons happy emotions catch fast
