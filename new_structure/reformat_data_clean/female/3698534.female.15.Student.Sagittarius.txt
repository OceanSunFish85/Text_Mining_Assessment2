ashlee simpson lyrics pieces monday waiting tuesday fading wednesday sleep phone rings hear darkness clear view cuz come rescue fall fall fast hardly catch breath hope lasts chorus seems like finally rest head something real like way feels known better ever knew love tell pieces pieces pieces pieces pieces pieces moody messy get restless senseless never seem care angry listen youre happy mission wont stop til fall sometimes fall fast well hit bottom crash chorus seems like finally rest head something real like way feels known better ever knew love tell pieces pieces pieces know everything say obvious written face hope never goes away yeah monday waiting tuesday fading arms breathe chorus seems like finally rest head something real like way feels know better ever knew love tell love tell love tell pieces pieces pieces pieces pieces pieces um favorite song right luv adrienne
