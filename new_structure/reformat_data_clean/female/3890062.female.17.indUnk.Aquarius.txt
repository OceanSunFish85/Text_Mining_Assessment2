put like burnin end midnight cigarette broke heart spent whole life tryin forget watched drink pain away little time never could get drunk enough get mind night put bottle head pulled trigger finally drank away memory life short time bigger strength get knees found face pillow note said love till die buried beneath willow angels sang whiskey lullaby rumors flew nobody know much blamed years years tried hide whiskey breath finally drank pain away little time never could get drunk enough get mind night put bottle head pulled trigger finally drank away memory life short time bigger strength get knees found face pillow clinging picture dear life laid next beneath willow angels sang whiskey lullaby
