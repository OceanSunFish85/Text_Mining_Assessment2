skin deep love barely stare straight know shatters heart dart dash around truth set loose rend heart dark let ignite living spark hard guard know lies cries pit lord flies trickery dies one done one life knew inherently blew away like feathers wing oh sing saved eternal grave spirits hear loud clear fear love dove wings flap leave behind divine find along sing song c crystal joseph
