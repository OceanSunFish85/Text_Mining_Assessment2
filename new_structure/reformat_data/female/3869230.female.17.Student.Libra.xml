      Summer is half way over for me. It hasn't really felt like summer at all actually.  Working has taken up so much of my time that I can barely make time for much else. It is looking a little bit brighter though. Next week I have off 4 days in a row while my mom sister and I head up to Erie for a little getaway break/ enjoy time together before I leave kinda thing.  I can't wait. Then I have a week...then I leave for Pheonix...and that'll be a blast.  Then 3 weeks after that I leave for college. I can't believe it's coming this fast.  This weekend I go up and plan out all my classes. Yikeso!   Today I had to work at 8-2. That wasn't so bad but I was busy the entire time. I don't so much like cooking like I thought I would.  Then I came home and hung out before I went to youth group. We played that scavenger verse game tonight..and I had to set it all up. I bet I hid like..50 some words. That took FOREVER. It was fun tho. Then I came home and had some of Mom's ham dinner..and then my stomach got worse and was hurting so I tried a hot bath and that did nothing. So thenI got in bed and Jonathan called and made me feel better....:)  Oh well.  I am going to get to bed now before I fall off my chair...g'night world
