      ~This is a note by the author, Lesley Richards.  An odd setting for a story, I'm sure, on Blogger.com, but I figured what the hell. This will be a story written by a fifteen year old sophmore about her life in general. It's like this entire blog was written by her, except for this - and this is me. The real me. My main character, Ginny, is only a snipet of me, who I'm going to agonize and dote over in this story. Called Orion. You'll see why.  Do read. I'll post soon.~

      Ug. Just woke up. They watched Spirited Away, thank GOD, but I fell asleep like within the first fifteen minutes. No offense to the movie, of course, I was just really sleepy. Turns out everyone else was too, so I didnât get pranked. My party anyway. Well, not completely. Emily and meâs birthdays are like a week apart so we always just have this big one at her house (check that, actual house, not apartment. Rare for Houston, but Emilyâs filthy rich. I mean, this is River Oaks. I feel afraid to touch the carpet, really.) and this year was no different. She gave me a diary - you! I donât know, nor do I really care, what Orion actually looks like, because thatâs what Iâm naming you anway. Itâs because youâre black and velvety and very soft, with little fake crystals on you spread about in random order, but at your bottom right corner the little crystals spell out the word âDiary.â You are a diary, my diary, but youâre also Orion, because I want to call you that, and because I will. Tomorrow, I swear, Iâll go to Hobby Lobby and buy some of those little fake crystals and form the word âOrionâ in your velvet sky out of diamond stars. And you know what? Thereâs nothing you can do about it.  Iâm Virginia Elanor Kirby, but you must call me Ginny or you shall die. Nice to meet you too.  Breakfast is served, it seems. More like brunch, but whatever - itâs nourishment.  12:40 pm  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Just showered. Happiness is warm water, shampoo, and coconut conditioner.  Mum says hi. Accosted me about my presents. Says I must make a list so I can send thank-you notes. Sure. Can do.  Emily - Orion; light-up pen (v. cool); Barnes and Noble gift certificate ($30! Score!); black t-shirt that says â6 x 9 = 42â (Iâll explain later); and a gel-pen pack Yvonne - $25 g.c. to Hastings (Score again) and 2 Happy Bunny stickers (âyour anger makes me happyâ and âcute but kind of strangeâ - so me) Clair - very cute p.j.s ; blue slippers with floofy yellow star; and black nail polish. Wench (Becky Sue; but call her that and she becomes dragon-like) - Evanescence cd (they are too cool) and two pairs of socks (I love socks) Katy - black cloak from Ren. fest (awesome beyond belief) Vanessa - $25 g.c. to Barnes and Noble and a beautiful black rock that has rainbows in it under the light  There. Done already. Now have to write notes. Bleh.

      ~this is the beginning of the story. odd, I know, but work with me.~     Am too freaked to write right now. Typical. I finally get a diary and Iâm too scared to form coherent sentences. WHAT WAS THAT? Oh. God. Going to kill Emily. We just watched The Ring, see. Iâm the type of person who canât watch Jurassic Park  without seriously freaking out. Theyâre saying weâre about to watch South Park. Never seen it. Mum totally objects.  3:16 am  South Park was very good. Very funny. Very, very, VERY rated R. Must remind friends NOT TO MENTION the movie in front of mum. The Ring, too, âcause it was definelty rated R also.  No way. I just looked at the case. Rated PG-13. The ratings board were on crack when they watched this. The Ring is so incredibly R that itâs not even funny.  Extremely sleepy. But they want to watch Spirited Away. Either that or Gothika. Must convince them to watch Spirited Away. I donât think I could handle any more horror.
