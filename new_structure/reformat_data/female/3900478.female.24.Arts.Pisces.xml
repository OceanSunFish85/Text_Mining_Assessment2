      I had a very diversified portfolio for the last few months. I've kind of changed my trading style and it caused me to jump up on the leader board (significantly). Yesterday I was at T$9,821,925.78 and today I'm at T$26,259,810.16. I swear I didn't cheat!! So don't delete my account Satori!!  Instead of holding 30 or 40 small stocks, I reduced my portfolio to just 5 key stocks that I think have some growth potential. Because I put so much money in just a few stocks the prices shot up and my net worth went up (on paper) really high.  Sorry Tom. I'm sure you'll jump me back when I sell off, but I wanted everyone to know that I wasn't doing something too wierd on the market whent the new leader board publishes tonight.

      Iâm probably not going to post much today. I want to work on the CSS on my Blog. I donât really like the pink blog, so Iâm trying to learn to fix it. Hope for best for me :)

      Iâm amazed that the Philippine troops are pulling out of Iraq. I realize that there were only 55 troops there and they planned to leave in August. But letting terrorists control the military of a sovereign nation is unthinkable. I hope it saves the life of the Philippino captive, but I fear that this will further the terrorists to try to manipulate governments in this way. Once they find a tactic that works, they are going to try it again and again.    Maybe we should have a stock like âTerrorist kidnapers influence sovereign nation by threatening to kill a foreign captive?â

      What are up with terrorists kid-napping people, threatening to behead them, and then let them go?  There should be a strike stock that says that a prisoner is captured/hoaxed and set free.  Speaking of beheading, what do they do with the heads?  It would seem that they would pile up over time.  Wouldnât they?

      I have just started this blog.  I donât know if I will keep it up or not.  But I think itâs important for a woman to have a voice though all of the testosterone that exists on the TerrorXchange.  I think this site has its heart in the right place, but I also think that so many people that trade on the site are playing it like a long term video game.  I like to think of the Terror Exchange as a real-time poll of things that may happen.  As such, Iâm hoping to provide my own insights as to what may or may not happen in the future.  Happy Trading!!  Heather
