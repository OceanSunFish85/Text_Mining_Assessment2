      Who says that classical music is boring?? Well... ok, maybe it is, but it's so soothing! That and Hawaiian music (ahhh, the euphonious music of Iz) can calm you even in your most terrible mood! I've been in a good mood today, so it just mellowed me out even more... hmmm, mellow - makes me think I've been doing too much pot. oops =-0    Well, hebedebehdehebeedede (lol, I can't even type it, let alone imitate it) that's all, folks!

      Well, I don't know what to write. Usually I tend to ramble and I end up writing a book, but not today! I guess I'll just say that this is my first blog on here, and I'll update it as often as I can! Bye for now!

      Father...  Tears are falling...   Please help me right now - I'm not in good shape at all. Yesterday and today have been horrid, and You ordained them to be that way... well, You probably ordained them to be good despite all that's happened, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. All my expectations have been shattered, and it hurts! I really need someone to hold me tight right now and tell me how much they love me. Please do that for me... it says that You draw near to the brokenhearted - please keep that promise. Help me relax and enjoy the rest of my evening, despite the fact that it doesn't look very good... and help me shake that attitude. I'm ready and willing for things to start looking up... please make them better! You promise that You will wipe all our tears away, but mine keep flowing. You are a God of peace and love and comfort... gosh, I need that so much right now!! My tears pour out like a garden fountain - swiftly, profusely, and never ceasing. You can change that, and I ask that You do. You heard David's cries and rescued him... rescue me! Save me from the pain I feel right now! I need You more than ever now... please comfort me.

      They say that love is the greatest thing in the world, that you can do anything with it... well, don't let them fool you - you need to know the other side of things, like don't forget that saying "love hurts"... it does - you let yourself get too attached, and you get hurt, one way or another.  Love can be compared to Newton's laws of physics - "what goes up must come down." One day you're up on Cloud 9, and the next your heart is broken. Also, love requires a lot of effort - one stupid thing said or done can ruin the relationship... *sigh* I wish I could remember these things when I get involved with someone... :-(

      Well, I guess there isnât anything wrong, Iâm just melancholy â AGAIN. Letâs see, what words would describe me right now? Sad, lonely, worthless, hungry but donât feel like eating, tired, melancholyâ¦ yeah, thatâs me. Well, I have decided that Iâm going to ask my mom to take me to get tested to see if I am bipolar to any degree, and Iâm really dreading that. Itâs gonna suck. My anticipated response from her will be, âYouâre not bipolar, Lydia, youâre just miserable all the time, and you need to go to counseling for that.â Ha! I just came up with a counterattack for that! âMom, Iâm NOT always miserable, sometimes Iâm floating on Cloud 9 â that sounds like bipolar to me.â Someone advised me not to trust the internet, but I took an online quiz two times, and the second time I had different answers, thinking that Iâd come out with something like, âyou are somewhat depressedâ, but it still said I was bipolar! I donât understand â one question was, âWhat are your symptoms [of depression]?â and they had like 3 answers that were unmistakably bipolar â answers like, âelevated elation at times, and other times paralyzing despairâ. I donât remember the other 2 answers, but they were very similar to that one â mood swings of happiness vs. depression. Another question asked, âHave you lost interest in everyday activities?â and the answer that sounded the most like me was, âat times I feel like I donât care about anything or anyone. Other times Iâm on top of the world and can do anything.â Thatâs DEFINITELY bipolar. :( I remember one Saturday I was totally depressed, and was really contemplating suicide. Two days later, I was having such a great dayâ¦ and both were for no reason at all. Like that person said, I wonât place my trust in an online quiz, Iâll wait for results from a professional, but things donât look good. That makes me depressed. Iâve taken pride in being a ânormalâ person â no genetic disorders, no missing fingers or toes or anything, Iâm not blind or deafâ¦ I donât even have to wear glasses! So if I am bipolar, Iâm not ânormalâ anymore cuz Iâll have a mental disorder. So what if several million Americans suffer from being bipolar? Itâs only 1.2%, and highly the minority. I suppose itâs cool to be different, but not with something like this.   Current Mood: mildly depressed Current Music: Eminem - Lose Yourself

      It's been over a week since I've posted, so I figured now would be a good time. And last week was a pretty good week - it was my first week off of school, and it was very relaxing. I just listened to music, talked online, slept in til 11:30... yeah, it was nice. :) Friday I went to see Shrek 2, and that is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Puss in Boots is hilarious! The donkey is funny too, but annoying. My friend went to L.A. this weekend, and I missed him a lot, but he's back now, so I'm really happy! Church today was good... don't have to do anything for the rest of the day, or tomorrow... yay! Oh yeah, soccer on Tuesday... :-/ that reminds me of last week's practices. They were awful!! Actually, Tuesday's wasn't really that bad, it just was for me cuz I was sick. Thursday was brutal - we went up and down the field (I don't know how long it was, but probably like 200 yards, which is two whole soccer fields :-O ) like 12 times, then we had to scrimmage, and if we were caught walking, then we were gonna do sprints, then the trainer got out a rope that we had to jump over, and by that time, my legs were jelly so I had to sit out and stretch for a bit. I felt bad cuz everyone probably thinks I'm a wuss, but I was gonna lose feeling in my legs after a while. So after that, we FINALLY got water, and then we shot for a bit, but it still involved a lot of running. When we had to scrimmage, I wished we could still shoot, cuz I was so tired! Well, I guess I'll end there, and post later!

      I am fuming right now!!!! I don't know why, but here I am, sitting at my computer, angrier than a hornet. I feel like today was a waste, and I'm waiting for it to end. I'm using this as an outlet for my anger, hoping that I'll feel better... *thinking* hmm, nope, NOT BETTER! I need something to smash, something to pound my head on... and yet at the same time, doesn't attract attention. It's times like these when I really start to see the pointlessness of life. Well, I think my "boil" has settled down to a "simmer", but I'm still angry. Maybe when I post again, I'll be feeling better.
