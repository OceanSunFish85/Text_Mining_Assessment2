      I NEED SOME FUCKING WEED... Well even though my parents are thinking about getting a divorce we are still going on vacation. Jessica I'm gonna miss ya when I leave. I hope that if my parents do get a devours that I don't have to move. I hope that my mom (who will be the person I'm going to live wit) stays here in Cherokee. But they way they was acting today I don't think that they will get a devours but like my mom says "only time can tell" man I think I deserve some ice cream. well I don't think my parents would think the same way because I guess I am the reason for them spreading further apart. Which to tell the truth really fucking sucks. I think I might have said that in the last blog. Oh yeah Jessica you know how I said that I was gonna become (you know what) well today I ate a lot of the funnel cake shit. And just to let you know you don't make funnel cake with just water and flour. HA HA HA Member when you told me that on the phone. I miss ya gurly. I hope my dad talks to my mom and lets me babysit. But my thing is will that lady let me. I mean she don't even know me. But yeah I am gonna go clean my room and vacuum it.   LOVE PEACE AND MUTHA FUCKING CHICKEN GREASE!!!  Q TO THE P HOLLA

      You hear your parents talk to you about rape and your first reaction to that is âThat will never happen to me.â Then it happens to you.  It was dark and you didnât know what to do.  So you sit there and cry and wish that what just happened to you wasnât true.  You shake and you shiver on the mattress on the floor.  And then when heâs next to you, you shake and you shiver even more.  And then when he gets close to you and he tells you to spread your legs you canât help to scream and move all around.  And the thought of running away runs through your head over and over again but you realize that it is to late now because he already has you pinned to the ground.     You hear people say that the worst part of being raped is the pain and bad memories but that is not all true.   What hurts the most is that your parents always send you this vibe that they will always protect you but yet they let this man rape and hurt you.  Not only that but when you came home that same night your parents donât even notice that anythingâs wrong.  So for the rest ofmy life untilI tell themI have to act like that never happened and Ihave to be strong.   By Kristine Pietsch

      Jessica what happened after you left my house with your grandma??? Did she yell at you?? I hope that you don't get put back on house arrest. I prayed for you after you left. Oh Jeeezze. And did you ever go to the doc.? HA HA HA I can't believe you got shot by a bb gun. Okay not a laughing matter. How do you feel? I think mason is sorry dude. I read your blog you wrote. He was all like sorry sorry sorry. I wish I could have been there. 1 I could have been wit you. 2 I could have been wit mason 3 I would have been able to flip out on Lee. Well as long as he said that he don't member and he didn't say that we didn't I'm okay wit it. But yeah. I don't think Jeff is feeling to good. He keep writing in his blog about how he wants to die. I don't want him to die. He is so sweet. I just hope he think about it real good. And then he changes his mind about it.   Well i'm gonna hit it up.  PEACE THE FUCK OUT!!! Q TO THE P

      I have made the decision that I am going to be that girl in the group and always listens to what you have to say about thing or just listens to you when your having a bad day. I don't wanna try to be bad ass cause I'm not. No need to talk shit you can't back up.  I hope that jessica gets on her Yahoo Messenger cause my dad took out my phone from my room  Tony, Mason and the little dude Sky came ova to the house. I don't know about Mason he can be so sweet at certain times but yet he has his moments and I think the next time I go over to his house and he was to "hop on the right foot and do the bad thing" I'm gonna tell him how I feel. I don't wanna fuck no more boys with out like going out wit them and I want to be sure that when I do take that next step I wouldn't mind him haven my kid or what eva *ya feel me* Prolly not. But yeah I just want to be prepared well i am gonna hit it up cause my girl jessica is talking to me now LOVE PEACE AND MUTHA FUCKING CHICKEN GREACE BITCH Q TO THE P
