       TAXI  As in any other metropolis, Buenos Aires is also full of taxis and the ride is very cheap. (The initial meter rate starts at 1.44 pesos.)Radio taxisare common in the city as well as Remises, which are private cars. They cost almost the same amount as the regular taxis, and you can reserve a cab any time or any place you want, and you canknow how muchyou'll pay beforehand.     BUS  Buses are called Collectivos. Once you arrive in the city you will realize thatthey are everywhere. There are more than 140 lines and you can get to any destinationusing the Collectivos. It'salso the cheapest way to travel around the city since each ridecostsbtw 0.30-1.25pesos. Don't forget though that buses only accept coins and you have to tell the driver your destination first thing when you step in the bus. To learn the right routes for you, stop at any tourist information booth and tell them where you want to go. They'll draw you a map and give you the bus #.     SUBWAY  The subway system in Buenos Aires is also very convenient. It's called the Subte. The ride costs 0.70 cents and unlike other major cities of the world, the subway is very clean.  you can check out theSubte Map clicking on the link below:     urlLink http://www.metrovias.com.ar/eng/contenido/contenido.asp?id_cat=35articulo=opcion=Mapsestilo=14id_cont=168link=cate=manual=1

      The city of Buenos Aires has two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarni (Ezeiza), serves international flights, and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (Aeroparque), serves domestic and regional flights. The cost of taxi (car service, which is also called Remise) from Ezeiza to downtown Buenos Aires is 45 pesos and takes approximately 45 minutes. Aeroparque is very close to downtown,it takes 15 minutes to get to the airport from downtown and costs 13 pesos by taxi. From Ezeiza,Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n Bus Companyhas frequent bus service to thecity center, which costs about 16 pesos.If you reallywant to go budget with transporation and are not carrying a large luggage, public transportation costs 1.35 pesos but takesalmost 2 hours.    You can also find ferry and hydrofoil services in Buenos Aires to and from Uruguay. The ferry to Montevideo/Colonial leaves from Puerto Madero and also Tigre at regular intervals and costs 45-95 pesos.    The main bus terminal in Buenos Aires is Retiro and here you can find a bus to go anywhere in Argentina and most places in the region.Here you can find the main private bus companies in the region and frequent service.

         Economy     âThe cycle of economic roller-coasting, political instability, military brutality and growing wealth divisions has continued to plague the country for decades. Since 1989 inflation has fluctuated wildly and unemployment soared; the peso was pegged one-to-one against the US dollar with disastrous consequences, leading to harsh restrictions on bank withdrawals and cash shortages.  The upshot was that in December 2001 Argentina defaulted on a US$132 billion loan repayment - the largest default in history. As a result, rioting, looting and widespread civil chaos in which 27 people were killed broke out on Buenos Aires' streets. Endemic political corruption has only compounded the economic malaise. This has lead to a revolving door of leaders, reaching its nadir in January 2002 when Eduardo Duhalde became Argentina's fifth president in two weeks.  President Duhalde unpegged the peso from the dollar; the currency devalued by more than 50% almost immediately. Savings were decimated but withdrawal and foreign exchange restrictions meant little could be done. However unpopular, the move was necessary to secure any further aid from the IMF. In a positive sign, the devalued peso has done better than expected in the world currency market.â

        History    It was in 1536 that Buenos Aires was established by Juan de Garay. Buenos Aires was very poor until trade took up. The main trade that made Buenos Aires flourish was feral cattle and horses. Later, Buenos Aires and the region, back then called the RÃ­o de la Plata, prospered and advanced beyond Spainâs authority. The Revolution against the Spanish rule took place in 1810 and then the independence in 1816.  âAfter a disastrous and tyrannical period of rule by the Federalist Juan Manuel Rosas, Buenos Aires and Unitarism prevailed, ushering in a new era of growth and prosperity with the Unitarist constitution of 1853. European immigration, foreign investment and trade were hallmarks of the new liberalism. However, excessive foreign interests made the economy particularly vulnerable to world economic downturns; wealth was ultra-concentrated, and unemployment rose as smallholdings failed and farmers were forced to leave the land and head for an increasingly burgeoning capital ill-equipped to deal with the influx.â  High unemployment combined with low income caused labor militancy to grow. The result of this protest filled era was La Semana TrÃ¡gica, the Tragic Week, where the strikers were brutally suppressed.  âAmbitious municipal projects during the 1930s transformed the face of the downtown area forever into the sprawling grid of wide avenues running through the heart of the city. Gone were the colonial-era streets as Buenos Aires sought to stamp its air of European sophistication on South American tradition. Following WWII Gran (Greater) Buenos Aires began to absorb surrounding suburbs and the weight of its growth bore problems of decaying infrastructure and public services, the spread of shantytowns and rises in unemployment, inflation and underemployment.â    I have looked through some guides aftre my Buenos Aires and Patagonia trip and I think the best guide is the Lonely Planet. You can also stop by a tourist information booth anywhere in BsAs to get free maps of the city, cultural events, historical places and many more...
