      Dear Journal,             Well, to catch up for you:  I met Jeremy 3/15 at Zone 154, and I called and talked to him 3/17.  I think I took his comments a little too seriously and the wrong way.  Well, Iâve been thinking about the conversations I had with Mama and Kim, and then with Jennifer about Jeremy.  Iâve been thinking maybe he really wants to hook up; otherwise why would he be bugging Brian to call Kim/Jennifer to give me his number??  So anyway, I called him 8:30 tonight.  We talked about 30 minutes.  We cleared the air about the misunderstandings, and we talked about all kinds of things.  I told him I wouldnât mind if we could hook up this weekend.  He said he would like to.  Before I even called him, Iâve been thinking of asking Mama and Kim if I can go to Kimâs this weekend.  Weâll see...             When Jeremy and I were saying our goodbyes, he says, âBye baby doll.â  Thatâs so kute!  I told him Iâd try to call him tomorrow night.  I wonder if I can mange to get a calling card free off the web, like I used to do.

      Dear Journal,             I always get this feeling like Mamaâs mad at me; not just in a bad mood, but mad/ill at me specifically.  On those rare once-in-a-blue-moon nights when I go out with Kim, the days that follow are bad.  She says nothing, but when she looks my way, I feel like Iâve done something wrong.  Her look is icy.  Of course itâs just me!  But I really believe that, although Iâm her daughter and she loves me and sheâd do anything for me, I really believe that she doesnât like me.  I always feel guilty about going out, or staying at someoneâs house.  I feel guilty when I get home with or without a hangover, whether I had a great or lousy time.  But I always feel worse when I have fun.  Mama had the same look in her eyes when I asked to use the phone; she knew I was calling Jeremy.  She says she understands that I need to get out once in a while, but Iâm pretty sure sheâs meaning a job to go to.             Why do I allow myself to feel guilty?  For having a night of fun?  For allowing myself to slip out of my world for 1 night, just 1, into a whole new world...  A world of chaos and excitement, one where I get to be whoever I want, experience in one night all I missed in 5 or more years.  Why do I feel guilty?  I know I feel guilty because I let myself go, I let myself forget... Who I am, what I am and whatâs waiting for me back in my world.  So, perhaps, it isnât Mama at all; perhaps itâs just me!  Itâs me!  I let myself forget, and wonder what-ifs... Thatâs why I feel guilty, why I am guilty!  Itâs not Mama at all, itâs me!!

      Dear Journal,            I went out last night with Kim and Jennifer, and their friend Christa.  I actually had a lot of fun; I was half expecting to be so bored out of my mind Iâd get too drunk and sleep in the car until we left.  I didnât get bored the whole time there, there being Zone 154.  I saw a few people I used to know, and met some new ones too.  I saw Chris Watson, went to school with him.  He used to be short and pudgy, but now heâs tall, thin and hot!!  Heâs got a major infatuation for Jennifer.  I also saw Jonathan Wilkins; we âdatedâ briefly in 1995.  We saw Dwayne there, and Terri too (Terriâs one of Kimâs flings).  New people I met were Edward (Kimâs crushingâ), Jason, and Buger aka Brian.  And thereâs also Jeremy.  When we first got to the club and I saw him, I thought he was so cute, just so you know it wasnât the alcohol.  He told Brian who told Christa who told me that he wanted to hook up with me.  That was so kute!!  What I know about him:  Hmm, well heâs 23, his birthday is June 28th, heâs got a job, and a truck.  All day Iâve been thinking about Jeremy, debating on whether I should get his number.  I kept thinking, âWell, heâs probably lost interest...  I bet he thinks I blew him off (after talking outside with him a while we went in and I danced with Jonathan)...  We live too far away from each other to ever consider having a relationship...  We practically in two different worlds!â  But a bit after Kim and I got home, she came in my room and gave me a piece of paper.  When I looked at it I was confused, excited and hopeful, but mostly just flattered.  Jeremy- (919) 732-5499 Will I call him??  Hell yeah!  Iâm not stupid.  Kim told me later, âYou need to call him, so heâll stop calling Brian, and so Brian will stop calling me and Jennifer.â  It turns out he called Brian like 5 times telling him to call Jennifer to call Kim to give me his digits.  Iâve had a smile plastered to me face ever since.  And heâs NOTHING like what I usually go for.  Heâs tall, and big, not fat, but big...  Heâs definitely got muscles in those arms.  While we were outside talking, (among other things I said) he asked if he could kiss me.  I so so SO wanted him to, but I just kept changing the subject.  Oh my God!  I actually told him one of my fantasies (one that no one knows, not even Kimberly)!  I donât know why I told him, but he was just like, âWhy watch when you can be in on it?â  Iâm so glad heâs still interested, because I really do want to get up with him!!

      Dear Journal,             April 19th- I went to Matt Tippettâs party.  I drank a lot, but not enough to forget the eveningâs events.  Well, I did some regrettable things: 1.  I told Matt how I feel about him, even after all this time, and then I kissed him.  He pulled away, walked away and the next day, he remembered NOTHING, not a SINGLE thing I said or did!  I felt so sick, so damn REPULSIVE!! 2.  I stayed when Kim left; I should have left with.  #3 explains why. 3.  I made out with Marcus, after trying to hook him up with Kim.  I only hit on him AFTER he told me about the French kiss between Kim and Matt!  We got close to sex, but suddenly he was blew me off!!  He told me, nicely I guess, to get out of his car.  He said we should go back inside.  Hey Amy, REPULSIVE much? 4.  Rob and Walker were flirting with me.  Eww!  Robâs weird and sleeps with his eyes Â½ open, and Walkerâs like my dadâs age!             I should explain.  Iâm naive when I drink.  No, Iâm friendly, thatâs how I see it.  Iâm a happy drunk!!  But Kim says Iâm a drunken slut.  Josh says Iâm basically Iâm a drunk naive bitch.  People who are my friend or my siblingâs friends just see me as a fun drunk!             I saw Sarah though; sheâs about to graduate from ECU.  I also saw Deena Szary; she goes to ECU also.  I also met two guys, Josey and Ander.  Theyâre black (so of course nobody wanted drunkard Amy around them); they were so cool.  Josey sounds like a talk show announcer; Ander was really quiet, but had sweet almond eyes.             April 20th- I saw the old trailer park; there were lots of changes.  Mamaâs pissed at me for not leaving with Kim.  Donât worry, Mama, I am too, but more so!  I missed Jonnyâs first Easter.  Mama says,  âDid you forget you have two kids at home?â  âIts nice to see youâd rather not be spending Easter with them!â              Why argue?  After this past weekend why would I ever want to go out?!  Itâs safe here, with my boys.  They donât find me repulsive.

      Dear Journal,             Okay, so Iâm going to stop saying maybe later today...  That letter will get in here eventually.  So, anyway, Kimberly called me tonight; I was so glad she called.  Her mom got her a cell phone with free weekends, so hopefully weâll be able to talk again soon.  I gave the brief âlowdownâ on stuff.  I told her about Jeremy; she said, âCall him back!â  I told her my letter left today and she should get it by Wednesday.  When I have time to stop during the day, I wonder what Iâm going to write to Donnie.  Also, hopefully Iâll remember:  A while back I got Charlotteâs email address and Julie and Valerieâs too.  I need to write to them, see how theyâre doing, and ask Julie and Valerie how their dadâs doing.  Remember to put them in my address book (SEND ONLY CLEAN EMAILS), of course Iâll ask them first if theyâd mind a few forwards and emails and such.             Donnieâs letter really bugs me; I guess it was sort of heartfelt, but Iâve got no way of knowing whatâs up his sleeve.  Is he truly sorry?  And for what exactly?  How he treated me,  dropping off the face of the planet when our son was barely a week old , for not attempting contact until an entire year later!?  That little bitch, he still gets under my skin!  Iâm not really tired but my head hurts really badly.  Too much on my mind at once; canât think straight or see clearly now...

      Dear Journal,            I havenât gotten that letter in yet; maybe todayâs the day to get it in and done.  Iâve kept pretty busy this weekend, with cleaning and all.  But once the day is done and the beauties sleep, my mind wanders off.  I roam into the past, the future, what could have been and how itâd change my life as it is now.  I wonder how my reply letter to Donnie should go, or if I should let it go at all.  I miss him nearly everyday as the father he is and can be to Jonny.  Sometimes, though,  I forget to hate and despise and dislike him and find myself missing him for what he was to me.   I will always love him; we both know that to be true, you and I.  But whatever, if any, type of relationship we ever have again, itâll NEVER be what it once was.

      Dear Journal,             ...  Okay, got a letter today...  Itâs from Donnie dumb fuck!  I just finished a 5-page letter to Kimberly telling her about it (amongst other things).  Iâll probably copy his letter into here, so that when I look back I wonât have to study each freakingâ word for 5 minutes (sucky ass spelling and handwriting).  But 1st hereâs the short version:   Iâm sorry I havenât been there for you and Jonathan.  My head wasnât in the right place.  It is now.  When I get out of prison, July 2003, Iâm going to get a job and start sending you some money.  (BTW, heâs in prison for probation violation).  How does $250.00 sound each month?  Please forgive me.  Children need a mom and a dad.  I want to be able to do father and son things with Jonathan.  Please write back to me.  Can you send some pictures of Jonathan to me?              In my letter to Kimberly, it was more in-depth; plus, I told her about Jeremy, the boysâ birthdays and party etc.  Iâll try to get that letter in later.  P.S.  The carton of cigarettes I just finished lasted from March 27th to April 11th.  Thatâs pretty good, huh?

      Dear Journal,             I saw a commercial on depression.   âDepression takes your enjoyment out of daily ânormalâ life.â   Iâve been depressed for so long, I donât even know what my daily ânormalâ life would be like.   âCause is unknown... Chemical imbalance in the brain...  No cure is known, but with treatment, you can work on getting back... To normal.â              Emptiness; Hopelessness; no enjoyment in anything; forced to force a smile, a laugh; forced to stay quiet when the tears want to come.  When Matthew is upset or mad at me, he tells me he hates me.  I find myself thinking:  Why not?  He has good reason, right?  I do nothing for him; Iâm always irritable, Iâm always yelling at him.  I canât even get stuff for him- clothes, toys, etc...  Heâs a mean kid because Iâm always mean!  Itâs my fault!!  Its at least Â½ my fault for the way Kara is!  I know sheâll hate me a long time because of how she turned out, how she will turn out if she continues being the way she is.  The other Â½ to blame is Kim.  I canât get into all that right now though.             I canât talk to Mama, though I really wish I could!  She listens like a mother, but I need a friend.  When I tried talking to her about Jeremy, I donât know, something I said, she took it like we had sex, and that I was good to go for a hotel room.  I SO WASNâT!  If I was, we would have that 1st night, and I wouldnât be so confused about a guy that Iâd end up talking to her about it!!            I havenât called Jeremy backed and, as much as Iâd like to have something with him, Iâm not going to call him.  Only part of the reason has to do with Mama, and her instant guessing about me.  Did you know, right after I had Matthew, Mama had the AUDACITY to ask me if I had something going on with Jeff!?!  An affair with Jeff??  EWW!  How so fucking gross!!  She never made me feel so low.  I couldnât stand to even look at her, or Jeff, for the longest time.  I didnât do anything, and yet I still felt guilty that I caused her to think so sickly of me!  So ill and disappointingly of me she felt.  Does she still think of me in such horrid ways, so negatively??

      Dear Journal,             Okay, so Iâm depressed.  Big deal!  Iâm always depressed!  But itâs different this time.  This time thereâs reasons. 1) Is April 26th and 2) is May 4th.  Here I am once again unable to buy my kids something for their 1st and 5th birthdays! I donât know how to fix me anymore.  I used to devise plans and schemes to do something about my problems.  But now I just want to cry and feel pity upon myself.  Iâve been cut off from the world for so long, I donât even know what Iâd do in it anymore.  And, here lately, whatever anyone (mostly Mama) says to me, I always take it like theyâre calling me stupid.  I feel stupid, I feel retarded, disabled to the point where I donât know myself anymore.  Sometimes I wonder what Mamaâs thinking.  I wonder why she puts up with me.  I clean fairly well and watch the kids, but I do nothing to help her out; I support nobody, nothing.  Sometimes I wish sheâd yell at me!  Make me do something; make me WANT to do something!  Make me drive when we go somewhere!  Make me get off my fat ass and find a job.  I suppose that wouldnât work either; then Iâd just hate myself even more for letting her, AGAIN!

      Donnieâs 1st letter to me:  Amy, Waz up, nothing here. Amy I am sorry for not being there for you &amp;amp; Jonathan! Iâm in prison on my probation violation. I know you probably donât want shit to do with me but I do want to be there for my son, when I get out of here, around May or July. I hope you can forgive me for not being there. My head wasnât in the right place. Iâve been on the run for the last 8 months. I have been wanting to see my son so bad, but I was afraid. When I get out I will get a job and pay you some child support. I think this time has done me some good. I now have my head in the right place. I want to get to know Jonathan and do all the stuff fathers and sons do. Will you send me some pictures? If not, thatâs okay. How much do you want a month? I was thinking $250.00. What do you think? Amy Iâm so sorry! I hope we can work something out for Jonathanâs sake. He should have a mom and dad. I will sacrifice my whole life to be with my son! Now I donât have to worry about the cops every time I turn around. I know you donât understand whatâs in my mind, but you know me better than anyone else does. I just hope youâll let me be a part of his life! And we can get along for it. P.S. If you get this please write back please. Sincerely, Dopey (Dopey used to be my nickname for him)

      Dear Journal, Josh gave me a great idea tonight on how I could earn some money. He was talking about calling places to see if one can still get paid to give blood, and plasma. He says to me, âAmy, you could sell your eggs; they pay like $2000.00 for them.â So, I have a project; search around for a fertility clinic around here, call and get info on it. Iâm also going to search blood and plasma banks as well. And itâs not just about the money, because there are people out there in dire need of these things. Money is just a plus! Well, I found some listings. Also, I found the phone number and address of one Ms. Mary McFatter, Billyâs mom. 612 East Main Street, Haw River, NC 27258. One way or another, Iâm going to nail that bastard!! I also found an email address for a Don Springer. Going to check it out tomorrow.  urlLink GoBothWays@juno.com  Hey, it could happen.

      Dear Journal, Coming this weekend, Kim and Jessie are to be moving out. Things are stressful here lately. I keep doing something or another to irritate Mama. I start a new weight loss pill tomorrow. Also, Dr. Shaikh says I have to have my tonsils and adenoids removed. Iâve been thinking about it and Iâve decided that, when I get it done, no more cigarettes! This will be my first surgery thing, pregnancies excluded; Iâm a bit nervous about it. Mama says I must believe in God, if I believe what the Bible says, referring to âIn the last days, one will not be able to tell between the seasonsâ. Why? Jerusalem got snow! A lot of it! I do believe the world will end soon; I feel it deep inside. Iâm scared though. Everyone who believes in God that he is our savior will go to heaven. But I donât know what I believe; Iâve got no religion. Iâm confused about âGodâ. Will I go to Hell due to my confusion and uncertainty?? Will I become simply a lost soul, doomed to wonder the chaotic world or whatâs left of it?? Yes, that scares me.

      Dear Journal, Its high time I wrote to introduce myself, and my dilemmas. I have two beautiful sons. Neither of them were ever mistakes! Simply unexpected miracles. Matthewâs father, Billy Jo Hatch, was a mistake! I met him when I was 15 years old; I was at Kimberlyâs for Ralph/Harleyâs birthday. Billy was Ralphâs âbestâ friend. That year, I was just boy crazy in general. And I had the advantage of being built like a mid-twenties gal! He was 20. I guess we hit it off pretty well. The first and very last times we had sex were great; all the ones in between were a blur, you know, bad enough to forget. Early 1997, July or August, I ran away from home. That also happened to be my last time running away. I got to Burlington by-way-of Gary, someone Kim used to know. I stayed with Billy and his mom, Mary McFatter. Billy was so surprised to find me there at his house, he was speechless all night! Kimberly was in Nebraska at that time, so I was pretty bored mostly. Mama didnât call the cops on me this time; I suppose she knew its do no good. I was a stupid kid!! I saw life like I was on top of the world, a free spirit! Mama brought some of my clothes to me, and even took me to buy a dress for church. If you ask me my regrets in life, Iâd tell you. It was hurting her!! September 4th, 1997, I called mama, reluctantly, and told her that I was 4 weeks pregnant. I heard her heart BREAKING, and I just wanted to DIE! And I tried; before I thought about that life inside me, I tried ending mine. You name it, I tried it. That was the longest night of my life. I suppose I shouldâve seen these failed attempts as a sign from God, but no, I didnât. On September 16th, I came home for Karaâs birthday. I went back to Billyâs after a brief stay. In November I moved in with Kimberly (she got back late September) and I broke it off with Billy. Yes, I left him! Its kind of funny, because when I told him the baby news, he was ecstatic. He walked into traffic, while telling everyone he was going to be a daddy. But something happened; one night he got a serious, insane look in his eyes, looked at me, and told me if I ever TRIED to leave him, Iâd never see our son again. But before that, something else happened, between Billy and Amy; I think I realized he wasnât good enough for me. I mean he was PERFECT for me as a person, but as a mother, no. My child would be in danger! Kimberly and I told Billy I was visiting my grandpa in the hospital for the weekend. Knowing heâd never be home at night, she and I walked from her grandmaâs to Billyâs and back again, with my belongings in hand. Every step I took closer to her house, the surer I was about this being the best decision Iâve ever made. At 4 months pregnant, I went back home. I know my mom was happy, to at least have me home safely. I think I implied to family that Billy beat on me. Iâd like to take this moment to say he didnât. It would have been great to get his stupid ass arrested for abuse, physical and sexual, on a minor, but alas itâs not true. He came really close one night; I told him I cheated on him with, BTW heâs really racist, DeFonse-a black guy he knew of, and Hector-an Hispanic he didnât know, but his sister Tammy did. I think at that moment I wanted him to hit me. Cutting only goes so far for oneself; perhaps I wanted someone else to cause my physical anguish/sublimity. April 25th, 1998 at 10:00pm, while reading in my room, I started my contractions of labor. I swear, I was the only one who was calmly getting ready. Really, I was playing my game boy. After 15 Â½ hours of natural labor and Mama by my side, Eric Matthew Yates blessed the world with his 7 pound 5 ounce presence. The last time I saw Billy was July 1998. He was sobering up, swearing he was getting better so he could be a father. He asked me to come back to him, to at least be with him 1 last time. I said no. Yes, somewhere inside I loved him, and I wanted to say yes. But I knew whom he was, how he thought. And I had a really bad feeling about him right then. Put aside all the good things, and all the bad things, I still knew he wasnât ready to grow up, and be someoneâs father. Jonathanâs daddy is Donald Ralph Springer, Jr. He and I were Jr high and high school sweethearts. 2 Â½ years, on and off, together. I was in love with him, really! I quit school October 1996 and we lost touch. November 21st, 2000, Josh and I got in a wreck. It was my first real wreck, and my last to date. I began having strange feelings, my anxiety attacks reached new unknown levels; My obsessional thoughts went to worst-case scenario dreams, thoughts that I have less or no time left for stuff. So I first ended my little feud with Daddy and I started looking for Donnie. After so many years, I began thinking of him, everyday. I figured Iâd never really find him, but I kept at it anyway, and one night online I found an address under the name Donald R. Springer. I mean, how many people can there be with that name?? So I sat down and started writing the letter; I sent it mid-December. Well, I received a reply in mid-January, and we began writing to one another, and then gradually started talking on the phone. Early March, soon after we began visiting with each other, we began the intimate relationship. All those old feelings came rushing back all at once! That was a mistake that we both made; we picked up where we left off in 1996 when we were just kids, but we should have started over clean slate. September 11th, 2001, my mom and psuedo-dad rushed me to the ER due to severe stomach pains, which turned out to be a cyst. The doctors ran different tests and it was confirmed to our fears: I was 4 weeks pregnant. 4 weeks pregnant again, and feeling Mamaâs heart break again, all I could manage was âIâm sorryâ to Mama. I couldnât even look at her. After that night, I couldnât find Donnie to tell him. It turns out Kimâs pill-popper boyfriend Dwayne told him. When he finally called me, I could tell in his voice he wasnât happy; he did not want this pregnancy to continue. Let me say, in 1997, my dad offered to pay for an abortion. I said âno way in hell!â Donnie denied wanting an abortion in my 2001 pregnancy, but I told him âeither way, no way in hell!â Gradually, after that first conversation, our relationship deteriorated. I saw him 1 time throughout my pregnancy, when I was 6 months along. That was the last time I saw him. On April 26th, 2002, I told him this emotional roller coaster heâs taken me on wasnât healthy and that he was really being mean and selfish. Yes, I left him too. I loved him so tremendously, and although I know he loved me back, he didnât love Matthew. I knew he never would or could. So I ended it between us. My kids come first! And I only want whatâs best for my kids. May 4th, 2002, after only 2 Â½ hours of induced labor and no drugs, Mama right there by my side again, I gave the world another miracle, Jonathan Michael Yates. Theyâre growing up so fast, but their daddies will never be witness to any of it. What if they were ready? What if I was wrong??
