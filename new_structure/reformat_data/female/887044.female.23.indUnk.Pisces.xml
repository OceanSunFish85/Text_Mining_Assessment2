       Eg lykta eins og sinubruni sudur med sjo.   Vann til klukkan 10 i kvold og for tha og hitti Justin sem sat i myrkri i bakgardi vinar sins og grilladi pulsur handa mer. Hann saetur ?! Oh, ja, svo sannarlega.  Drakk thar ad auki thann besta bjor sem eg hef lengi drukkid. Köningsbrau ur flosku, bara thad sama gamla, en hann smakkadist mer svo einstaklega vel i kvold ad eg skellti i mig tveimur a orskotsstundu. Sit annars bara her nuna, drekk vatn ur flosku og hyggst fara i baelid von bradar.   Gledilegt sumar !

       Eg og sigarettan  erum skilin ad skiptum. Og komnir rumir 2 manudir sidan vid attum seinast í nanum kynnum.  Their sem koma af fjollum og vissu ekki ad eg reykti, tja, i hreinskilni sagt vidurkenndi eg aldrei sjalf ad eg reykti. Eg var sko alltaf bara svona  felagsreyklingur . Byrjadi haegt a thvi pua einn og einn nagla i partyjum i 3. bekk i MR. Vard svo  utlandareyklingur  og  felagsreyklingur  en thegar eg flutti svo til utlanda vard illt i efni. Finu reglurnar um hvenaer eg maetti reykja og hvenaer ekki fyrir borg og by. Akvad raunar ad eg myndi aldrei reykja i Heidenheim en su agaeta regla vard ad osku a innan vid manudi.  Thegar eg sneri aftur i januar jatadi eg svo fyrir sjalfri mer ad eg reykti. Eg var buin ad missa stjornina og tha var kominn timi til ad haetta.

      Tja, datt i hug ad thad vaeri kannski hugmynd ad hafa bara serstaka sidu fyrir thad bull sem eg gerist sek um a islensku. Eiginlega halfgert bogg ad vera ad skrifa a badum tungumalum, og thvi aetla eg ad gera sma tilraun og sja hvernig hun fer. Er ekki viss um hversu dugleg eg verd yfirhofud ad skrifa, en thad verdur bara ad koma i ljos.   Hef thad annars bara alveg agaett. Ryksugan stendur ognandi og bidur eftir ad eg taki til og verdi svo dugleg og taki til, en einhvern veginn hef eg limst vid thennan stol og langar mest litid ad standa upp. Mer finnst eg pinu heimilislaus thessa dagana, thar sem eg er mestmegnis hja Justin og voda litid her 'heima hja mer' og er eiginlega buin ad missa alla tengingu vid thetta herbergi mitt. Sem var raunar eini stadurinn i thessu husi thar sem mer leid saemilega venjulega.   Annars hef eg komist ad raun um ad manni getur nu lidid prydilega a ymsum stodum. Eg hef bara lifad ansi vel an alls dotsins sem eg sankadi ad mer heima a Islandi. Thetta herbergi mitt er lika merkilega fullt af doti. Skil thad eiginlega ekki, en thad virdist fylgja mer ad safna doti. Sem betur fer hef eg lika laert ad henda.  Mer lidur nu stundum eins og beduina hjoli, endalaust a milli stada med fotin min i poka, en eg geri rad fyrir ad lif med kaerasta se stundum eitthvad a thessa leid.

Eg er buin ad eyda sl. dogum i thad ad vera pirrud ut i thau, en er buin ad komast ad thvi ad i raun aetti eg bara ad vorkenna theim. Mer finnst samt alltaf sorglegt ad vorkenna folki. Eiginlega finnst mer vorkunninn sorglegri en pirringurinn, en thad eru ekki margar tilfinningar eftir i stodunni i theirra gard. En thau eru samt agaet. Eda thannig sko.  Hef engan ahuga a thvi ad tiunda theirra gjordir i minn gard, get bara sagt ad eg se ekki alveg satt vid theirra hegdun i minn gard. Ekki thad, eg vinn ju bara hja theim og thau mega eiginlega hegda ser eins og thau vilja a medan thau halda samninginn. Er samt alltaf nogu barnaleg til ad trua a lagmarkskurteisi og almennilegheit. Serstaklega thar sem eg er ju svo rosa almennileg =P Eins og mamma sagdi i dag... Thau eru ekkert skrytin, thau eru bara svolitid bilud...   Er annars bara i guddi filing. Held eg. Er adeins ad hondla stress, og hofudverki sem hljotast af minu stressi og er ekki buin ad vera serlega framtakssom upp a sidkastid. Thad stendur hinsvegar til bota. Fra og med half sjo i fyrramalid thegar eg fer a faetur. Og amen fyrir thvi !

      fimmtudagur, 21. ágúst 2003  Það er komin nótt. Og ég er hér enn, að reyna að kynnast þessari tölvu minni og láta mig lynda við hana. Þessa stundina gengur það dræmt því ég skil hvorki upp og ofan í þessu öllu saman og finnst manúalinn gerður fyrir klárara fólk en mig.  Ég er líka voða lítið búin að skoða hann. Og hafa lítinn tíma til að klappa tölvunni og vera góð við hana. Finnst lyklaborðið ennþá heldur asnalegt, langt í burtu og lítið, músarborðið er agalega erfitt í meðförum og ég skil ekkert í þessum fídusum sem ég á að vera með í tölvunni. Tja, ég sem hélt að ég væri svo klár.   Er annars bara þreytt. Komin með hundleið á vinnunni sem ég á að mæta aftur í eftir rúma 12 tíma og hlakka aðallega bara til að komast út til Þýskalands og byrja á þessu öllu saman núna.  Ég er farin að sofa. Ég meika ekki meir.   föstudagur, 22. ágúst 2003  Vildi stundum óska að ég ætti frí. Bara svona smá frí. Frá hverju veit ég eiginlega ekki. Bara frá öllu. Smá stund þar sem ég þyrfti ekki að gera neitt, þyrfti ekki að hugsa neitt eða hafa áhyggjur af einhverju. Bara ég í rólegheitum. Kannski er ég bara full stressuð yfir öllu. Sérstaklega svona hlutum sem ég get ekkert gert í, eins og svörum frá skólunum, Justin og einhverju fleiru. Áhyggjur af öllu. Og svo er ég sífellt að afsaka mig og segjast vera stressuð. Kannski ég ætti bara að hætta að vera svona stressuð og slappa svolítið af. Ég held stundum að ég sé bara að fara með mig með þessu veseni.

       Jamm og já  Neikvæðni: Vika þangað til ég fer út. Flugmiðinn minn frá Köben til München týndur í pósti og ég hef enga lausn á vandanum. Ég er enn heimilislaus í Tübingen. Bankareikningurinn minn lofar ekki góðu. Ég var að rífast við kærastann í gær. Ég sef ekki vel á nóttunni. Símreikningurinn kom í dag.   Jákvæðni: Eftir akkúrat viku verð ég komin út og allt vonandi komið í lag.  4 lítrar af rauðvíni, nokkrir gæðaostar, súkkulaði og góðir félagar bíða mín í kvöld.  Ég ber mig annars bara vel og hef að leiðarljósi að "betra er að fara á kostum en taugum."

       Saga dagsins  Þannig er mál með vexti að ég er að leita mér að herbergi í Tübingen.  Ég er búin að vera að skrifast á við ungan mann sl. viku sem er að leita sér að meðleigjanda. Hann er einstaklega almennilegur, búin að skrifa mér marga langa pósta, senda mér myndir og bauð mér svo herbergið til leigu í fyrradag. Þar sem það eru 2 aðrir sem ég býð eftir svari fá, og vil eiginlega frekar leigja með, svaraði ég honum ekki fyrr en áðan. Svarið var neikvætt.   Nokkrum mínútum seinna hringir síminn. Það var hann. Það skal tekið fram að ég er ekki í símaskránni. Hann vissi hinsvegar hvað mamma heitir og hvar ég bý. Þannig fann hann einhvern veginn símanúmerið mitt og hringdi til að spyrja hvort ég ætlaði að taka herbergið.   Var ekki búinn að fá póstinn frá mér. Mér var hætt að finnast þetta sniðugt... Ég sagði honum það sama ég hafði sagt í póstinum. Og er að vona að þar með sé þetta útrætt mál.   Og vona að ég fái jákvætt svar fái e-m öðrum líka.

      naestum 2 manudir sidan eg hef bloggad a islensku. Aetti ad skammast min eiginlega.  Tja, en eg er herna nuna. A undan mer voru nunnur herna. Svolitid sidan kannski, en samt.  Sit nefnilega i gomlu klaustri, sem er nuna bokasafn  skolinn hans Justins.  Bokasafnid herna er bara algjort aedi. Glaenytt med nyjustu blodin og baekurnar, og rosalega fint internet sem eg ma nota fritt, eins lengi og eg vil.  Bara verst ad thad er bara opid fra 10-12 a laugardogum. En eg nyti mer tha thann tima sem eg hef.   Justin farinn a hljomsveitaraefingu. Nefnilega unplugged tonleikar i kvold. Verdur vafalaust mjog gaman.  Eg a hinsvegar eftir ad kaupa inn, laera, bada mig, thvo upp og laera meira. Og svo fara og hitta strakana og hlusta a tonleikana.   Strakar eru skrytid folk. Var eina stelpan i strakapartyi i gaer. Rokk Fannst eg naestum vera ad gera mannfraedirannsokn thar sem eg sat og fylgdist med theim.  Skemmti mer tho prydilega. Bjorinn var godur og vid horfdum a Monthy Python sem getur bara verid GOTT. Og svo mjog sura mynd - The Cell. Hefur einhver sed hana? Amk. einstaklega sur mynd, en nokkud athyglisverd engu ad sidur.   Thad er gott vedur. Solskin. Bara hid besta mal.   Dettur i hug ad thetta gaeti ordid godur dagur.   Er stressud ut af skolanum.... thad er ekki svalt ad hafa of mikid ad gera og vera ekki viss um ad thad hefjist.   Svo er eg lika dalitid kritisk a haskolanam thessa dagana. Finnst thetta vera svo vodalega  fraedilegt allt saman. Langar helst ad taka upp munnhorpu og vaxliti og reyna ad vera kreativ. Kannski er eg bara enn a leikskolastiginu...   Godur strakurinn herna a bokasafninu. Er buin ad loka, en leyfir mer a sitja lengur medan hann gengur fra.  Thad er stadreynd ad folk er gott. I fyrradag hljop eg ut ur husi og var ad missa af lestinni. Lestarstjorinn sa mig, ok a moti mer og beid.   Folk er bara gott. Kannski af thvi ad eg er med rautt har og geng i rondottum sokkum.  Annars held eg ad thetta se bara almenn godmennska svona.   ......Skal Guja !

       Pælingar   Þrátt fyrir einstakt annríki hef ég alltaf tíma til að pæla. Sem betur fer :) Pælingar seinustu viku eða svo hafa mikið til snúist um það hversu merkileg svona sambönd eru. Líklegast af því að núna erum við Justin bráðum búin að vera saman í ár og hvorugt okkar hefur verið svona lengi í sambandi áður.  Mér finnst bara svo athyglisvert hvað maður getur orðið náinn á stuttum tíma. Hlutir sem voru annars bara eðlilegir með nánustu fjölskyldu, eru núna eðlilegir með þessari manneskju sem ég vissi fyrir rúmu ári ekki að væri til.   Kannski líka af því að þessi vissa er orðin til staðar. Þessi vissa að það má ansi margt ganga á og gerast áður en að sambandið gefur eftir. Ekki það að ég sé mikið búin að vera að 'testa' þessa vissu. Þetta er bara svona tilfinning.   Það sem mér finnst skemmtilegast af öllu er að ég er alltaf jafn skotin í honum. Á hverjum föstudegi sit ég í lestinni með fiðrildi í maganum og er alltaf jafn hamingjusöm á mánudögum þegar ég fer heim til Tübingen. Ég hélt einhvern veginn í mínu reynsluleysi að eftir ákveðinn tíma yrði maður bara vanur þessu. Kannski tekur það bara lengri tíma.   Ég yrði ekki vinsæl ef hann vissi að ég væri að blaðra um hann á netinu... sem betur fer skilur hann ekki mikla íslensku ennþá =)  Annars er það er yfirmáta dásamlegt að búa í Tübingen. Ég er bara svo kát með það núna, og svo kát með að vera flutt í sæta, sæta herbergið mitt. Þetta lítur allt vel út núna, og ég vona bara að mér gangi vel á prófunum mínum þannig að það komi ekkert bakslag í alla hamingjuna ;)  Til þess að mér gangi vel þarf ég víst að læra ... sem er það sem ég ætla að gera núna....

       Sorglegt   Ég fékk fullt af E-mailum. Einn þeirra var óbeint til mín, hinir 10 í tengslum við bókmenntakúrsinn minn. Mjög sorglegt.

       Í lestinni   Alltaf gott að geta notað tímann vel og skrifað eins og eitt blogg. Ég er ennþá að komast að því hvað það er dásamlegt að eiga svona tölvu og geta farið í tölvuleiki, skrifað pósta og auðvitað lært hvenær og hvar sem er. Náttúrulega allt annað líf líka eftir að ég fékk nettengingu heima  og nettengingu hjá Justin, jafnvel þótt ég sé frekar löt við að fara á netið þar.   Helgin var ekkert alltof góð. Ég fór til Justins á fimmtudaginn og okkur til ánægju og yndisauka vorum við í fýlu út í hvort annað fram á föstudag. Ekkert sérlega skemmtilegt, en það getur víst ekki alltaf verið sólskin... stundum er líka ágætt að hafa smá óveður til að hreinsa loftið og tala út um hlutina  Laugardeginum eyddi ég ein heima lesandi Pride and Prejudice. Justin var í vinnunni og svo á hljómsveitaræfingu þannig að ég gat ótrufluð lesið allan daginn. Ég þurfti að lesa hana af því ég er að fara að tala um byrjunina á henni á morgun og það er náttúrulega nauðsynlegt að hafa lesið bókina ef maður ætlar að hljóma gáfulega., ekki satt? Laugardagskvöldið kom svo töluvert á óvart  Justin kom heim og fór með mig í partý þar sem mér tókst að drekka í mig ansi mörg prómill og var af þeim sökum rúmliggjandi í gær. Held að ég hafi skemmt mér vel  seinni hluti kvöldsins er eitthvað þokukenndur... ahemm ;)  Og nú er ég á leiðinni til Tuebingen. Með dótið mitt í bakpoka og engan mat í ískápnum heima eins og vanalega .Það er svo merkilegt að lifa svona sígunalífi og eiga eiginlega heima á tveimur stöðum. Sem betur fer þarf ég bara að borga leigu á öðrum þeirra, en er jafn dugleg við að breiða úr mér á báðum, kærastanum mínum oft aðeins til ama. Ég er að reyna að vera húsleg...í alvöru. Það er bara svolítið erfitt.   Talandi um mat þá er ég búin að léttast um allnokkur kíló á sl.mánuðum. Spánarferðin og veikindin voru upphafið að þessu og ég hef ákveðið að halda aðeins áfram og sjá hvort mér tekst ekki að verða spengileg fyrir sumarið. Ég var nefnilega orðin frekar búlduleit og mjúk, amk. mýkri en ég kærði mig um, en nennti ekki að gera neitt í þessu. Enda eru megranir hundleiðinlegar. Það er auðvitað miklu skemmtilegra að borða súkkulaði !   Jæja, er að verða komin hálfa leið og þarf að stíga út bráðum.

       Gleðilegt sumar =)    Ég velti því fyrir mér hvaða veður er á Fróni núna. Er ekki hefð fyrir því að það sé rigning á sumardaginn fyrsta? Eða er það bara á 17.júní? Hér er amk. rosaleg blíða. Heiðskírt, 15 stiga hiti og sólskin. Ég er einstaklega þakklát fyrir gardínurnar sem mamma saumaði handa mér því annars hefði ég bránað í rúminu mínu og lekið á fætur um 7 leytið.   Ég er komin í helgarfrí. Ekki það að vikan hafi verið sérstaklega erfið, en samt pínulítið. Á þriðjudaginn tróð ég mér inn hjá enn einum lækninum, og fékk loksins sýklalyf hjá honum. Ég er mikið betri og vona að þetta sé upphafið að endinum í þessari baráttu minni.   Tímarnir mínir eru svona upp og ofan. Var kannski búin að hlakka of mikið til...Bókmenntakúrsinn minn er athyglisverður, ekki nema 10 með mér í tímanum, prófessorinn nýfluttur til Tuebingen og var alveg á tauginni. Hann er voða ljúfur og virðist vita sínu viti, en hann titraði og stamaði í 2 tíma á þriðjudaginn og mér fannst það ekki alveg nógu gott. Dálítið skrýtið þegar kennarinn er stressaðri en þú ... Ég er að vona að hann jafni sig á þessu með tíð og tíma. Það besta við kúrsinn er það að ég þarf ekki að halda fyrirlestur. Ég hef óbeit á fyrirlestrum. Vita líklegast flestir sem voru með mér í bekk í MR því þegar ég held fyrirlestra roðna ég og blána á víxl, buna út úr mér fyrirlestrinum á mettíma og svitna úr hófi fram. Dálítið þversagnakennt eiginlega því mér finnst voða gaman að tjá mig, en þegar það eru fleiri en 5 að hlusta á mig fer ég í kerfi. Ég er bara feimin... ég get ekkert að þessu gert ! :)  Ég gladdist of snemma yfir þessari lausn frá fyrirlestrum því í gærmorgunn fór ég í fyrsta tímann í norrænum fræðum og fékk áfall. Algjört áfall. Þetta verður mjög erfiður kúrs fyrir mig og ég var með höfuðverk og magapínu þegar ég kom út. Á að skrifa fyrirlestur í júlí og er strax farin að láta mér líða illa yfir því...  Restin af deginum var annars alveg brilliant. Við Guðrún fórum á  urlLink NECKARMUELLER , sátum úti í sólinni við Neckar og fengum okkur ljúfan hádegisverð. Í eftirmiðdaginn fór ég í tvo skemmtilega kúrsa í enskunni og hitti svo alla á Stammtisch í Bierkeller eins og hefð er fyrir á miðvikudagskvöldum. Góður dagur semsagt...   Í dag á ég stefnumót við Marylen í mensunni (=kaffitería háskólans) og ætla svo að fara til Justins í eftirmiðdaginn. Geri  stórlega ráð fyrir að koma heim á sunnudaginn því Vigdís Finnbogadóttir verður í heimsókn í háskólanum á mánudaginn, heldur fyrirlestur um morguninn og verður svo í Brechtbau í eftirmiðdaginn. Ég er að vísu í tíma frá 14 til 22 á mánudögum, en ég ætla að reyna að hitta á hana.   Æi, það er svo gott að vera til í dag. Ég vildi óska að ég gæti deilt útsýninu mínu með ykkur... skógivaxin fjöll svo langt sem augað eigir, sólskin og fuglasöngur í bakgrunninum. Það besta við að búa í Þýskalandi er hvað það vorar snemma og haustar seint :)

       Ég hef ákveðið ...   að fara fyrr að sofa að reyna að halda herberginu mínu í lagi að blogga meira á íslensku að borða hollari mat að kveikja oftar á kertum að skrifa oftar bréf að vera ekki lengur lasin !  Já ó já... ég er ennþá kvefuð ! Þetta er mikil sorgarsaga sem virðist ekki ætla að taka neinn endi. Í dag erum ég og kvefið að halda upp á 4 vikna sambandafmæli, jafnvel þótt þetta sé algjört nauðungarsamband og ég sé búin að leita tvisvar til læknis út af þessu. Sl. þriðjudag fór ég svo aftur til læknisins eftir viku af lyfjatöku og hann sagði að ég væri orðin hraust. Tveimur dögum seinna er ég aftur komin með hálsbólgu og díbblað nef og núna hósta ég eins og fimmtugur strompreykingarmaður með bronkítis. Ég ætla að finna mér nýjan lækni á morgun. Ég segi kvefinu (sem er raunar búið að stökkbreytast í kinnholubólgu núna) stríð á hendur.   Næsta mánudag ætla ég að vera orðin hraust !!!   Fall er fararheill.     Ég átti hryllilega ferð til Tuebingen frá Justin í morgun. Átti að taka 2 tíma en tók rúma 4 tíma. Ég er sem betur fer búin að læra að æsa mig ekki yfir of seinum lestum. Maður skyldi halda að í landi sem er rómað fyrir stundvísi myndu lestirnar koma á réttum tíma á leiðarenda. Ó nei...  ekki aldeilis. Eiginlega reiknar maður með seinkunn í hvert skipti sem maður ferðast með Deutsche Bahn...  Það sem fer hinsvegar í taugarnar á mér er þegar það kemur enginn og kíkir á miðann minn. Þessa helgina keypti ég lestarmiða fyrir 20 evrur sem engin sá nema ég. Það er stundum svo sorglegt að vera svona löghlýðinn...

      From now on, I will write here in English and in Icelandic on the other site. Not that I think anyone actually cares. Expect for maybe the Icelanders who seem to be much more interested in what I have to say now that I write more in Icelandic.   But enough about that. The changes are good, aren't they?! It had been dark and gloomy for long enough. Maybe next fall I'll change it back to blue or grey, but I am having such a green phase recently that I just couldn't help sharing it with the rest of you.   Life is going well. Very much stress and stuff going on at university, but otherwise I'm pretty good. Going on vacation with Justin on Thursday, to a nice little hotel in Bavaria, just to relax and leave all the stress at home for a few days.   And then we'll see my sister and my mother on Sunday :) and most importantly I'll see a tiny little angel with red hair for the first time...

      Ritað laugardaginn 1.maí   Engin tenging   Er að reyna að pirra mig ekki yfir þessari ótrúlega lélegu internet-tengingu sem virkar aldrei og nota tímann í að skrifa blogg í von um að það komist aftur á samband bráðum. Er semsagt hjá Justin og er að reyna að nota þráðlausa internetið sem aldrei virkar.   Var að klára smá lúr. Er búin að sofa alveg agalega síðustu nætur og þurfti að ná mér í smá orku til að geta haldið áfram með daginn. Í kvöld er nefnilega Musiknacht í Heidenheim (þ.e. hljómsveit á hverri knæpu) og við ætlum auðvitað að fara. Þetta er svolítið eins og menningarnótt heima, allir niður í bæ að labba um á milli staða, skoða og skemmta sér.   Gærdagurinn var góður. Ég keypti mér hjól ! Ég fann smáauglýsingu á netinu um daginn, hringdi og fór svo í gær og sótti hjólið. Ég keypti það af fjölskyldu sem býr í smáþorpi hérna í grenndinni. Eftir að ég hafði keypt hjólið fór ég í smá túr um þorpið í sólskininu, og óskaði þess að ég ætti digital vél því það var allt svo dásamlega lítið og sveitó og allt ilmaði af kúgamykju og heyi.   Hjólið mitt er æðislegt. Fjólublátt dömuhjól með 5 gírum og bögglabera :) Þýsk gæðavara af bestu gerð ! Það er 6 ára, lítið notað og kostaði mig ekki nema 60 evrur. Það er svo gaman að eignast nýtt hjól... ég eyddi eftirmiðdeginum í að þrífa það, tók keðjuna af, og þvoði allt hjólið hátt og lágt. Verst að það rigndi  í allan dag og ég gat ekki notað hjólið  en ég er viss um það verður nóg af tækifærum í framtíðinni.   Góðar fréttir  ég fékk námslán ! Mikil gleði því vegna allra þessara breytinga sem ég gekk í gegnum í haust, var ég ekki viss um að lánasjóðurinn myndi lána mér... en, ég fékk mitt fyrirframlán og get núna slappað af og einbeitt mér að skólanum.   Oh, það er svo gaman í skólanum ! Ég er var meira að segja búin að læra heima fyrir næsta þriðjudag síðasta miðvikudag. Það er svo góð tilfinning að vera duglegur- þótt ég verði að játa að ég hafi ekki verið sérlega dugleg þessa helgina. Ekki ennþá... ég hef einn dag í viðbót !

      I have a job for the summer ! A well-payed 8-4 job, working for a pharmaceutical company. Just read the E-mail saying that I was hired, so now I can stop worrying about that, focus on my exams in July and look forward to my new job which begins on the 3rd of August. Wow... I'm thrilled.   In 7 minutes I'm supposed to be teaching my friend Alex Icelandic. It's actually not so bad because I can't be bothered studying. I'm trying to finish my Old-English translation for today, but she told us to do so much homework that I feel a bit overloaded and when that happens, I become lazy. We had an Old-English exam last week and I was the 3rd highest in class. Thought that was pretty cool ;) The final exam will obviously be a lot harder, but it's good to have such a good grade on this one because it gives one motivation and .. it also counts into the final grade.   The exams are a month away but they are already occupying my mind quite drastically. As I've mentioned before, I have an oral exam in literature and I've been putting together my reading list this past week. This weekend serious reading will begin.  Oh... my time is up and Alex is probably already waiting...

      Yesterday was so good. Everything worked out, I was motivated and excited but today is the exact opposite somehow. Maybe I should keep in mind that it is not a good idea to take a nap before one goes to class. Even before that, nothing was going according to plan. I'm having a bad hair-day too... and my mom is gone. Tomorrow will be better, I'm sure.   The weekend was wonderful. My mom came on Thursday and stayed with me until this morning. We had a lovely time walking around Tuebingen, talking, eating good food and relaxing. It was so nice having here, catching up a bit more and showing her how I live and where I live. She gave me some nice presents and helped me organize everything a bit more so now my little room is looking even better. And it helped me to hear her say it was nice. I'd been worrying she was going to think it was dirty, disorganized or a bit empty, but she just liked it a lot. My mother's approval matters - a lot.   It's been a busy 10 days. Now things will quiet down a bit for a while, fun stuff coming up - Iceland's Independence Day is on Thursday and we're having a party, I'm going to see Justin on Friday and summer is here :) It's pretty nice. I have a lot of books arriving per post and to the library so it will be a cosy weekend reading, relaxing and... yeah, writing an essay.

      Mom's coming tomorrow and I just finished the first part of cleaning up this place. It's pretty aweful at the moment, I've actually gotten used to it, but I don't think my mom would appriciate the dust all that much.   The best thing about this place is my closet. I can walk into it ! It somehow feels very Sex and the City, especially now that I've put all my shoes in a row and made some more order. Granted, I don't have any Manolo's in there but hey, I'm a student ;) I'm working on being able to afford shoes like that ...  It's hot outside. Even if it's one a clock at night and both my windows are open, I'm all sticky and drowsy. It's mid-June and I'm complaining. How will it be at the end of July when I am taking my exams?  Taking a pretty big exam this summer. My mid-studies literature exam, the only lit exam I will take until my Bachelor exams. I'm only half through my second semester and I'm taking big exams already... Sometimes I wonder whether I will make it because I have a feeling I don't know much and haven't read much, but then I surprise myself like I did in class yesterday and actually believe...   I see it as a positive challenge. And if I don't make it, I can always try again next semester.   I'm unhappy with my blog. Somehow I feel more comfortable writing in English but more Icelandic ppl seem to be interested in me at the moment, so it only seems rational to keep them updated on my life in my own language... and I'm not sure about the green. It seemed like a brilliant idea at that moment but now it seems too mainstream and kind of dull.   I'm being extremely random. Did you notice? I should just give up trying and go back to sleep.

      At the library at Justin's place. Just handed in the books I borrowed for my exam and I can hardly believe it's all over. After all that reading, studying and preparing...half an hour of an oral exam and suddenly it's all over. I did well. Actually I did very well. And I am exceedingly happy about it :)  I have left Tübingen. And I'm not coming back until the 12th of October or so. I'm here until tomorrow, in Munich until Thursday and in Iceland until October.  I'm going home ! I haven't ever been away from Iceland for such a long time... Don't think much has changed though. Never does. That's the good thing about it.

      It's just a little bit too hot these days. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have a huge exam tomorrow, but because I do and I don't have time to sit outside and eat icecream or lazily nap at home, I am complaining !  This time tomorrow I will be happy. Maybe not so happy with my knowledge about English literature and my preformance on the exam, but I will definetly be happy to be finished.  And Justin will be here, and me and Gugu are planning a 'party' in the park and ... I'll be fine. Just need to get over the next 24 hours and then I will be fine.

      Just came from my English literature class, the last one before I have my big exam on Friday and I must say that I am stranded in complete panic now. I sat in there and seriously thought about telling the professor that I had decided not to take the exam but then I thought about ALL the stuff I have read for it (16 different works) and I realised that it would be a shame not to give it a go. And if I fail, I can always do it again, although I do not plan to fail this exam. I've never failed anything in my life and I'll be damned if I let this be the first time...  Don't have a clue how my exams went yesterday. Time will tell. Today I should have been studying for my old English exam that I have tomorrow but I've been too hot to do so. Seriously, it's murder to be in the library right now, but because of my personal messyness and my idiotic neighbour I cannot study at home. Now it's gotten a bit cooler so I'm going to give studying a go. Plus, the exam is at 4 so I still have lots of time tomorrow as well. And then... Friday will come along. Oh my...

      Last Saturdaynight I went to an awesomeCD Release party. urlLink Shiny Spooky Rabbit just released their first CD and to celebrate they had a brilliant concert in  urlLink K2  which was followed by a long night of partying ;) I haven't had so much fun in a long, long time ! Great guys, great band and a great CD ! My not-so-good pictures can be seen  urlLink here     And now...my fun week has begun. 2 exams today, 1 exam Wednesday and 2 exams Friday. Sympathize with me.

      At least I managed to do that this morning with 2 phonecalls. I am not moving.  It's a long story. In short, I had given notice on my dorm room and signed the lease for the new place when I realised there had been a misunderstanding. There is no internet connection.  Well, they have dial-up but I refuse to live witha slow, expensive connection and getting high-speed internet is really expensive. And, as I realised yesterday, I actually don't want to move.  As much as I despise my neighbour who kept me awake most of the night because he forgot to turn of the TV, I love my room, the big closet, the privacy and of course... the internet connection. So, this morning I called the university, took everything back I said yesterday, called the landlord and told her I wasn't moving in there after all. I made the right decision.   Maybe I should learn from this NOT to be spontaneous. Somehow this is typically me... going through with something and then, at the last moment, reversing it. Urr... such a waste of energy.   Studying went well today. Went through all of the poems I have to study for my exam and in 45 minutes I'm taking the train out of here. Actually, I should just move here. To the faculty library because I have spent most of my time here this semester. And I foresee doing the same next semester because I'll have loads to do. And I don't mind it actually. It's such a comfortable, familiar place that I even walk around here barefoot. Stressful weekend ahead. 5 tests in 4 days next week. This time next week I will be finished. In every sense of that word.

      but I'm moving again. In 10 days. Not to Iceland, but inside of Tübingen. To the opposite end of town, the part I can see from my window here. So, how did this happen?   Well, yesterday I finished class and was looking at all the ads hanging around the university when I noticed this one which sparked my interest. For some reason I gave them a call and found out the room was still available and went over there to check it out right away. It's in a nice quiet neighbourhood, about 10 minutes away from university (bike or bus). It's a normal house, but the first floor has been changed into a little apartment with four bedrooms. There's a tiny kitchen, a bathroom, and a central space with a dining table. It's tiny, but cute and clean, and I will have my own telephone for only 190 Euros a month. It's furnished, has ugly 70's curtains that I'm not allowed to change, but hey, it's clean and it's quiet. I'll be living there with 3 other girls and the landloard lives above us so - no partying allowed.  I just moved in here 5 months ago and I'm already moving out again. It's crazy but I don't like this place. Well, I really like my room, but I guess that's mostly because it's concise and it has my stuff in it. I fundamentally dislike the guys that live with me and the kitchen I cannot go into without feeling sick. Actually, my decision was made for me last night. My next door neighbour had one more of his parties, I managed to fall asleep but then woke up at 3 to him playing his guitar.    This place is just too caotic and noisy and ... dirty. Yes, I confess, I'm a princess, but then again, isn't it normal to want a fairly clean, non-smelling kitchen and some peace to sleep?  I'll keep all of you informed of my address change next fall. I'm going home (to Iceland) in two weeks so why say it now...  I'm tired. And I should pack and/or study. But it's midnight and now I will sleep. Tomorrow is another day.

      Haven't gotten up yet and don't know if I want to. Have to though, my room is an absolute mess, I'm meeting a friend at 1 and this afternoon I'm going to Justin's. And I'm lazy. So very lazy. Need someone to come over here and kick me...  At least it's not so hot outside as it has been the past few days. And so, I should have more energy. Maybe I should just get out of bed and see if that doesn't help.

      That's where I am. Far away from Germany... and missing it. Have come to like being here, but it has taken over a week and I must admit I look forward to going back. Got my ticket today. Gugu and I are flying to Copenhagen on the 5th of October and then getting ourselves from there to Stuttgart somehow. But, that's far away.   Now I just came home. Work was finished at noon because there was no blood. We sat around most of the morning, did a bit of cleaning, ate pizza and then got to go early. I like my job. The place is nice and friendly, the work is more demanding physically than anything else (which is a nice change from all the studying) and ... yeah, I like it, although I am pouring blood, pumping blood, cleaning blood... actually just being covered in blood most of the day.   Haven't done much since I came home. Been home a lot, watched TV, slept and relaxed and, I have also shopped a lot :) My Visa Card doesn't like it much, but it was time I got some new stuff.   Otherwise, life's OK. Some pictures will be coming later this week.

      After all this time, waiting... I am here. Moved into my room, ready to go into the coming 9 months. This weekend was very hard, but fun... Slept in mamma´s bed last night, couldn´t imagine being alone that last night at home. Did get wonderful news today though just before I left. Helped me to stop crying... which at the time was very needed. Now I know what I am getting for Christmas - I am going home !!! My god, I have been here less than 12 hours and I am already thinking about going home. Well, there is a reason for that. I like having my life in a certain, planned way. Even if I probably seem pretty easy going, I do like a certain "Ordnung". A part of that is celebrating Christmas at home with my family. I have celebrated Christmas the past 2 years here, in Germany, with my family but not at home. I swore last year I would be home for Christmast 2002... but I really did not see it happening until this morning when an angel made my day... So, thats all good !  As for everything else and actually the current events in my life, everything is fine. I feel a bit strange and I can´t get myself to go to bed, but I probably will go there soon.  For the moment I am learning (again) how to crochet. Amazing things one can learn over the internet ! =) Stefan, Stephi and Dominik picked me up at the trainstation today at 5 and took me to dinner in Ulm. I felt a bit handicapped, not being able to speak German that well, and even worse because I was tired and not really up to anything. The food was nice though, so were Stefan  Stephi, but Dominik was definetly the cutest of all. One cannot but look forward to spend time with him. He is just so much fun.  After dinner we drove home, Dominik went to sleep, we had snaps and watced the news and then I went into my room to unpack and just to get settled in here. I really love this room. 24 hour internet access, satellite TV, a double bed, lots of books, my own phone and mobile, a lot of space, my own bathroom and just finally, endless space for me. Even if I feel so so about it at the moment, I know things are going to look different - and better in the morning ...  So, I am going to finish my crochet lesson and go enjoy my new bed. I hope y`all had a good weekend !

      So, time is flying, and soon I will be too. It´s already Friday now - seeing that it passed midnight already and I am having serious problems with me leaving at the moment. Been sobbing on and off all evening. Sometimes I wonder why I put myself through all this agony - because this usually happens before I go travel - but I have a feeling this is going to be a pretty bad case of 'not-wanting-to-leave'. But I still wanna leave and I am still looking forward to it. It´s just that I want to take my family with me, and of course - the Icelandic candy and Skjar Einn (my favorite TV station) ... Today was good. My last full day at the kindergarten and my last shift at the florists. Tomorrow I will have to wake up around 9, but only to go to the bank and run some errands and I won´t have to be at the kindergarten until 12:30. I will miss my job though, of course. But I most certainly won´t miss all those long days of working I´ve had lately, having to wake up early, never having a day off and being tired all the time.  Ok, so I admit it. I am real confused about how I am supposed to feel right now. I look forward to leaving, but I will miss home more than I´d like to admit (that´s a good thing sort of though, right?) and it´s all just awfully hard at the moment.  But - if I know myself correctly, ti´ll be all good as soon as I sit down in that airplane on Sunday morning. And, even if it won´t, in the end, it´ll be alright. So much I know.  And ... I think for now I will take my mom´s advice and go to bed. I hope she´s right when she said that it would all be better in the morning.

       User Guide  So... As you might have noticed, there is suddenly a lot of new stuff on the left. The guestmap is pretty cool. Knowing that I have visitors from more than one country around here (which also explains why this blog is mostly in English), I thought it would be a nice idea for everyone who's interested to mark themselves on the map. Just click on it. It's pretty simple.  The poll explains itself. Just vote ! Don't you think my weather pixie is adorable? Well, most of you probably aren't interested, but anyhow, this way you can see how the weather is here. I think it's cute =) But now, I have to leave you and go get a bite to eat before I starve to death. Going out tonight :)  urlLink  postCount('þrír');

      CONFUSIA Það er mánudagur, og ég held það sé í lagi ef ég ræði aðeins sunnudagsþunglyndið mitt núna, fyrst það er liðið hjá.  Ég fékk eiginlega slæmt kast af sunnudagsþunglyndi í gærkvöldi. Þar sem ég átti frábæra helgi, finnst mér eiginlega vanþakklátt af mér að vera svona súr í lok helgarinnar, en þetta er bara svona eitthvað sem hellist yfir mig einstöku sinnum og þá er voða lítið sem hægt er að gera.  Ég sökk nokkuð djúpt í hugsanir og vangaveltur, bæði um fortíðina og framtíðina, sem hrellir mig raunar ofurlítið eins og stendur. Ég veit að ég er Au-Pair núna, og að þessi vetur er amk. í lagi. Ég hef bara áhyggjur af því að ég komi heim eftir 8 mánuði, ennþá gjörsamlega án framtíðarplana.  Stundum nýt ég þess að vita ekki neitt og lít á það sem frelsi. En til hvers er allt þetta frelsi, ef ég hef ekki hugmynd hvað ég á að gera við það?  Síðan ég fór að hafa áhyggjur af þessu fyrst, svona í mars 2001, hef ég svo oft heyrt að þetta eigi eftir að koma allt af sjálfu sér, ég eigi eftir að fá vitrun... að þetta reddist... Rúmu einu og hálfu ári seinna sit ég ennþá hér, með sömu áhyggjurnar og skammast mín eiginlega oft fyrir að vera ekki "að gera eitthvað af viti".  Hvað sem það nú er annars...  Og þeim meira sem ég hugsa um þetta, því verr líður mér. Það er yndislegt að eiga allt lífið framundan - mér þætti bara ágætt að vita hvort ég á nokkurn tímann eftir að finna eitthvað gagnlegt til að gera við það ... Mér er í raun óskiljanlegt hvernig nokkur manneskja getur valið sér eitt fag í háskólanum og að þar með sé sagan sögð. Mér er ómögulegt að finna mér fag sem ég get sætt mig við, land sem ég get lært í og allra síst get ég séð sjálfa mig starfandi við eitthvað eitt sérstakt.  Stundum held ég að ég sé hálfgerður kleifhugi, engan veginn í stakk búin til að ákveða nokkurn skapaðan hlut sem gæti verið til langs tíma. Svo er ég líka alltaf hrædd við að mér mistakist, að ég falli, hætti, og takist bara einhvern veginn að klúðra mínum málum. Ekki að það sé ekki allt í lagi svona inn á milli... ég vildi nú samt helst komast hjá því.   Ég semsagt bið ykkur öll hjartanlega velkomin í heilabúið á mér. Það er smá drasl þar eins og stendur.   Fyrir þá sem ekki vita, þá virkar commenta-linkurinn til svona =) : 1) þú klikkar á Comment 2) það opnast nýr gluggi 3) þú skrifar nafn og komment í þar til gerða reiti í nýja glugganum 4) þú ýtir á OK  5) gluggi lokast.

        My Weekend   Second try. I was here about an hour ago, but then my keyboard decided not to want to use the Icelandic anymore, which pissed me off beyond anything and I've been trying to figure that out...until Stefan came home and fixed it for me. I had actually told Stephi that I was going to fix it myself, but I had no clue what or how to do it, so ... I was very happy when Stefan came.   My weekend was wonderful. I left here around 3 on Friday and was in Braunschweig some 5 hours later. Again, I was lost somewhere in Germany, in the rain on a Fridaynight. I couldn't find the right tram, but (again) I was saved by a nice person, who showed me where I could take a bus to where I was going. And I managed.  It was so nice to see Vilborg and her daughter Sonja in the window, waving at me as I walked up to their house. Vilborg, Gunnar, Sonja and Stefán are an Icelandic family living in Braunschweig and are good friends of my brothers. Friðrik (my brother), by the way, arrived an hour later.  Me and my mom stayed with Vilborg and Gunnar for a week 6 years ago. Apperantly me and my brother also shortly visited Vilborg in '98 when I was there, but I have no recollection of that happening. In my mind, I hadn't been there in 6 years, and it was a strange feeling to step into that house again, sleep in the same bedroom, only so many years and so many experiences later.  First of all - they are such a nice family and one feels absolutely comfortable in their presence. Second of all it was priceless to be able to speak Icelandic for an entire weekend, and last but not least, it was great to see my brother !!! I am hoping he also enjoyed my company this weekend... =P   On Saturday Friðrik and I went to town, walked around, bought a present for little Stefán Atli (who is just 3 months old and absolutely adorable), and then we went to a student café and sat there for an hour or two, reading magazines. It was very relaxing and just... nice =) That evening Friðrik cooked a lovely dinner and we sat for hours eating and talking.  At noon on Sunday I headed back to my part of Germany, not knowing that I would get cought in a big storm and an hour delayed. The tracks between Frankfurt and Mannheim were closed, so we had to take a detour, and just as we were approaching Stuttgart, a tree fell on the tracks there and we had to wait half an hour.  I took a cab from the trainstation in Ulm to the movie theater where Stephi and Stefan were waiting for me, and they told me that people had actually been advised to stay at home. And there we were... at the movies. We saw Insomnia and enjoyed it, and obviously made it back safely.   I must say that I have begun to love Mondays. You know the feeling when you wake up on Sundaymorning and wish that the weekend was 3 days. Well, mine is. It's quite nice ... =P I think I am going to put an end to this blog, and let you comment !  I am so happy I finally have that thing up and going... it took a bit of blood, sweat and tears. I hope it'll work OK.   urlLink  postCount('einn');

      Going to bed, but first I just wanted to complain. Anyone who browses through other ppl's blogspot's knows these stupid tests that everyone has on there page. Well, I hate them.  If you wanna take the 2 that made me feel sick to my stoumache because I am such a lousy person - go to  urlLink Stebbig  and take the two latest tests there. First, the fruit test really made me depressed. I turned out to be a tomato - which is first of all the most disgusting thing I can think of and I can't even eat one myself, and then second of all, it was probably the worst to be a tomato out of all the "fruit" in this test. (Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't a tomato a vegetable?!!) Then this psycology test. My results weren't too bad, but answering those questions, not always with a positive answer, I was sure that my results were gonna be : "GO GET YOUR HEAD CHECKED ... and ps. stay away from other people " Yeah, I guess this is why I got - Paranoia : Moderate. Take the test please, so I might feel a little better about myself =)

      First I want to appologize to those who checked my blog last night and didn't find my new blog. I did write a blog last night, it just didn't publish until this morning. I am kindof pissed of at the moment because I had just decided to go to Munich on Saturday, but apperantly there's a 80% chance it's going to rain and I am most certainly not up for that. Sort of have the entire weekend off again, but don't really have any money ... and don't really have anything to do with my weekend. Not so cool... I must say !  Can you believe it, I have 6 hugantic (gotta love that word ;) moscito bites on me at the moment. All from yesterday and 4 of them in the radius of 10 cm. I was watching TV last night and this moscito joined me (she was actually sitting on the couch with me) and decided to eat my arm up.  I still haven't found her and brutally slaughtered that mean animal, but if I see her today... she won't live for very much longer ! I think I am going to continue my search for something to do with this weekend. I don't know why, but having from Friday afternoon till Sunday off somehow makes me want to go somewhere and see something. Living so in the centre of Europe and staying home in my little town seems a bit of a waste ...

      Amazing how time passes. Already it is an hour and a half away from Thursday and as everyone knows, when Thursday is here, the weekend is coming full speed around the corner.  Yesterday was pretty good, I slept in, took care of Dominik for the afternoon and then went to my german class. I somehow always feel a bit stressed when I go to that class of mine. Yesterday it even got worse, I was in the bathroom and all the girls from the east came barging in there talking russian. They were laughing and talking in russian and I left the bathroom, really feeling out of place. I guess all of this is a pretty good experience for me, feeling a bit outside and learning how to deal with that.  I am getting well along with 2 of the girls in my class though, one from Kasachstan who lives about 5 minutes away from me, and another from Latvia. And then one of "my kind" walked into the class yesterday, a boy from Finland. It was somehow nice to see someone so typically Scandinavian (like myself) in there, and hear is harsh accent.  [Just took a short break and talked to mom for 12 minutes. Am actually trying to get her to get some sense into my very confused little brain and I hope she will succeed because I have been trying hard lately without any luck] After the class me and Olga (the one from Kasachstan) walked home together and got to know each other a bit better. When I saw her for the first time last week she really didn't appeal to me and I was almost sad that she was the girl the lived so close to me and I'd be waiting for... Another lesson - never judge by appearances.   Today was nice. Well, I woke up too early this morning and for some reason I was feeling a little bit like a raincloud in a heavy storm this morning. I tired to deal with it while I was babysitting Dominik and when he was in bed for his nap, I sat down at the the computer, wrote my mom, unloaded my chest a bit and made a nice phonecall across the Atlantic.  Then I decided to enjoy my afternoon, changed clothes and biked my way downtown in the rain. Somehow I didn't mind the rain much at the moment. I had my wonderful, almost magical, green wool hat on, which originally belonged to my dad, then came into my possession (to my great joy and happieness ever since), then disappeared after my trip to Sweden with Kalli, but was found again in his bedroom half a year later. And here it is, still on my head and loved and adored every moment ....  I was completely soaked when I finally parked my bike downtown, but somehow it had been a nice relief from all my thoughts to bike in the rain, listening to some music and just relaxing.  I went window shopping in some shoe-shops, and then I went to the library and got what I had wanted since I knew the Heidenheim had one  - A library card !!! Of course I quickly found the foreign books department and walked out with 3 books in English :) I mean, if I wanna cuddle up in bed and read for half an hour before I go to sleep - a book in german isn't really what I want. I prefer reading something I understand, and can therefore enjoy.   So, I grabbed my books and went to my NEW favorite café. One has to have a favorite café ! I sat down with one of my books, a big Weissbier and a sandwich. Life could not have been any nicer at that moment...  And now I am here, at the end of this blog, wondering if I should go swimming with Dominik and Stephi tomorrow at 9, or wheather I should sleep in like every other morning. I'll try waking up... let's put it that way ;)  By the way - today (along with all the other confusion I have to deal with in my brain) I have been suffering over WHAT to study and WHERE to study.  I mean what I say now - you are all people who know me... If you have any suggestions... Write me please !  Otherwise... a big hug out to the world =P

      I almost feel guilty about not writing anything meaningful until now. I wish I could tell all of you that I was to busy yesterday, but the truth is that I slept most of the day. I worked some 2 hours in the morning, slept between 10 and 2, then again between 4 and 7 and went to bed around 11. I was just exhausted - and at the moment, I just woke up, so I slept some 10 hours tonight. It was just really one of those weekends that wears one out completely. Not sleeping enough (or hardly at all), not eating well enough, speaking German all the time, drinking maybe a beer too much... I am just getting too old for these kind of things ;) I almost didn't get there though. On Friday morning I left this house at 7 in the morning and was in Hamburg at 3. I walked around Hamburg for about 2 hours and... something great happened - For those who know me, you also know that I usually have this (VERY ugly my mom would say) green bag along with me. My family tends to wonder what the content of me green bag is and why I carry it around because its always full, but now I can make everyone happy and tell them that I have a NEW green bag =) A bigger one !!  Anyhow, that wasn't the important part of my story. At 5 O'clock I took the train to Poppenbüttel, a suburb of Hamburg where the infamous CISV house is.  When I got there, I had been told to take a certain bus to a certain busstop, and when I would get there, it wouldn't be a problem to find the CISV house. As I got out of the bus there, it was getting dark and I didn't see a trace of that CISV House. And of course ... at that very moment when I was lost, it started to poor down with rain. If my mobile had been working - I could have of course called my friends and found out how on earth I was supposed to get there, but since the battery had suddenly gotten empty on my phone that afternoon, I couldn't call anyone, or find anyone's number.   So, what to do, stuck in a far out suburb of Hamburg on a cold evening, in pooring rain, all alone and lost ?  I decided to ask for directions. I stopped this woman on the street, who had her daughter with her, tried to explain to her where I was going which fortunatly ended with her saying "Oh, you're going to the CISV house?" She told me that the house was half an hour walking from where we were standing and that the bus connections over there were pretty bad.  At that point I lost all hope... until she told me she would drive me there ;) And so we walked to her house, got the car and she drove me there.  I still don't think she comprehends how much she SAVED my weekend !.  My way back wasn't all easy either, there were some problems with the trains from Poppenbüttel so I had to change trains mid-way, and almost missed my train from Hamburg to here because of it. I had to run from the train, to the next one, and I am still praysing my luck having cought it, because had I not, I don't know how I would have gotten home - seeing that my ticket was only valid for this particular train, and I didn't really have any money at all.   But "All is good that ends well" (direct translation from Icelandic for those who don't notice :), and here I am, back home, on my way back to that CISV house in some 6 weeks. This time I think I'm flying. Cheaper (believe it or not!), quicker and easier. And, I already have the weekend off. The family is going to Bavaria to visit Stefan's parents, and I am free to do what I want... Not half bad.   In general I am doing well. Sundaynight me and my friend, with whom I had the huge fight, talked for about an hour on the phone and cleared things out as much as that's possible. We both lost our temper and yeah... I actually think I learned quite a bit from this fight of ours.   Otherwise, it's lunch time and I don't want them to have to wait for me.  Have a great week...

      Hey... So I am back home after my weekend in Hamburg, suffering from immense lack of sleep and some remains of alcohol in my blood. I had a lot of fun though, met some old friends, and made some new ones. Late last night I had a huge fight with a friend, one of the worst fights I have had in a very long time, and I am not really feeling quite myself today. And, it doesn't help that I haven´t slept more than about 10 hours this whole weekend.  So, I am going to give into the Sunday blues, turn on the TV and relax before I go to bed and try to catch up on some of that sleep I have been missing. I hope you all enjoyed your weekend.

      Wonderful day... I slept till 11 and then I took care of Dominik for some 2 hours after he woke up from his nap. His dad came and picked him up just before 4 to take him to the doctor, so now I am free until Monday morning !!! Pretty nice, I must say.  Yesterday was hectic somehow and I was for some reason extremely tired the entire day. I took Dominik around 8, and took care of him more or less until 5:30. At  we took our 4 O´clock walk and as usual, it was real nice. We have a set circle that we always go, first to the left out of our street, passed the cemitary, further down the hill and to the yard where the goats are - and there we make our first stop to watch the "meee meee ´s". After about 5 minutes of watching the goats (which Dominik could probably do all day long) we continue, and usually bump into a very friendly,  redhaired cat on our way passed the tree-factory (I am sorry but my dictionary isn´t all together perfect :),. It is such a cute cat, I would most of all like to take it home with me and yesterday I compared my hair with the cat´s and realised that me and that cat are probably distantly related =P.  Then we cross the bridge over the Brenz (the river that runs through Heidenheim), go passed the old mill, to the farm where we meet the cows.  Usually we have just passed the farm, smelled the cows or looked a little bit into the stall where they are, but yesterday I actually took Dominik out of his carriage and when in there. For the first 2 second Dominik looked at them and sayed MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO but then that moooo turned into a weep and he didn´t really know wheather he should be scared or not.  I decided not to give up, and did "i,i" (Dominik language for petting something/someone) with one of cows and then Dominik then realised that there was nothing to be afraid of. We stayed there for a few minutes - until I couldn´t stand the smell anymore :) And continued, back into the town, through the neighbourhood where Stephi will have her new practice in January, passed another bridge over the Brenz, and then finally to the playground.  It is really beautiful here. In those 3 weeks since I came here the trees have changed colours, and the forrest the surrounds us looks like a palette of all the autum colours one can dream about.The front windows overlook our part of town, Heidenheim Mergelstetten, with all it´s nice houses, trees and the two church towers. It is a valley, so it also overlooks the hills on our other side... an unfortunatly a very ugly cement-factory.  The windows on the back face into the neighbour´s yard, who today stood on a ladder in his appletree, getting the rest of the apples out. Dominik found that activity of his quite amusing.  I don´t think I have ever been as tired as I was last night. I ate dinner with the family around 6, Dominik went to bed and Stephi and Stefan went to the gym. Around 9 I was completely asleep on the couch infront of the TV, and half past 10, when they came home again, I was in my pyjamas, ready to go to bed. And as stated before... I slept until 11 this morning...   So, what am I going to do with my freetime ? I am going to town later on, to buy my ticket to Augsburg for tomorrow morning, then to my german class and at 9 I have a date =P With the Briget, the American Au-Pair who lives in Steinheim. We spoke again on the phone yesterday and I am looking forward to finally meeting her.   And then at the ungodly hour of 7:24 tomorrow morning, my train to Augsburg is leaving, from where I will take the fast train to Hamburg.  I will return Sunday afternoon. I don´t know if I will blog tonight, and if I will not - I wish all of you a good weekend !  I myself have no doubt that mine will be FUN =P

          Íslendingasögur !!! Nú er ég bara kát og glöð ! Ég snillingaðist loksins á það hvernig ég gæti breytt lyklaborðinu mínu í íslenskt og hér er ég, voða glöð að þurfa ekki að þjást yfir þessu asnalega þýska lyklaborði. Það tekur mig að vísu góða stund að venjast þessu aftur, en það er í grundvallaratriðum mjög mikilvægt fyrir mig að geta skrifað á íslensku með réttum stöfum =)  Fór í heilbrigðiseftirlit í gær og konan í móttökunni skrifaði niður mínar upplýsingar eftir passanum mínum. Nema hvað, þessa 2 og hálfan tíma (!!!) sem þetta tók var ég kölluð Frú Porsteinsdóttir. Ég meina, ég er kannski agalega smámunasöm en þetta fór í taugarnar á mér. Afgreiðslubeyglan hefur hugsað með sér "humm, þennan staf þekki ég ekki, þá segi ég bara að þetta sé P". Sem er auðvitað ekki rétt.  Ég geri mér fyllilega grein fyrir að þið sem hafið búið í útlöndum sitjið núna og flissið yfir tuðinu í mér, en svona er ég nú bara. Stoltur Íslendingur með ferðadellu =) Fyrir nokkrum árum var ég ekki svona stolt af því að vera íslensk. Ég kom iðulega skælandi í gegnum tollinn í Keflavík, alveg hundfúl yfir því að vera komin aftur á þetta sker.  Ég held raunar að þessi ferðadella mín hafi gert mér grein fyrir því hvað það er gott að búa á Íslandi, og hvað það er  alltaf  fallegast á Íslandi.  Já, já, ég veit, ykkur er öllum illt núna af þessu rembingi mínum en mér líður nú bara svona, og ég viðukenni það fúslega að ég skældi úr mér augun þegar ég flaug frá Keflavík, í roki og rigningu, bara af því að hraunið var svo fallegt ;)  " Hver vegur að heiman er vegurinn heim ..."

      So, I decided to use the lunch time (while Dominik is sleeping) for something useful, which does not include napping, eating or watching talkshows - which is what I have done with my lunch breaks so far ;)  am a happy camper today.... and I mean to tell you all why ! Yesterday I took care of Dominik for 2 hours, until his grandfather picked him up at 9:30 (he always spends mondays with his grandparents) and when he was gone I went back to bed and slept for an hour and a half. I mean, why not, I was tired, I didnt have anything better to do.. it seemed the only logical thing to do ;) I woke up and got myself ready and biked my way into town. Didnt get there though, because half way there I fell flat on my face off my bike.  I dont really know exactly what happened, I was on the bikepath and there was a little curve and suddenly I was flying of the bike, thinking SH*T , this cannot be happening to me right now ! I was wearing one of my favorite jackets and some nice pants and... the since I protected my face with my arm and landed on my knees, the pants are torn and my jacket as a huge hole in it.  The left shift on my bike is broken, and as for my own injuries, I have some scrapes and bruises on my knees, but otherwise, I am pretty ok.  It was just so frustrating, flying off my bike like that, into the wet pavement, and then having to go home again.   What was worst of all though was that a couple walked passed me when it had just happened (they saw the whole thing) and they didnt look at me, didnt say anything, didnt care. I mean, maybe its just me, but when someone flies off their bike infront of your nose, wouldnt you at least ask if everything was alright?!   Well, I went home again, changed, called my sister and complained a bit and got back on my bike and this time - made it into town ! Bought some new pants to wear around the house and bike with, and then spent over an hour in the underwear-department, without any real success. Unfortunatly for me, but very fortunatly for my wallet ;)   At 5 I then met up with 2 girls, one from Ukrania and then the Russian girl I mentioned before. I already know Lena, the girl from Ukrania, and Marina, the one from Russia, is really nice. We had a nice afternoon together, had a beer, walked around town, had an icecream and walked up to the city castle and then shortly after 8 I biked my way home. So, I have friends !  This morning I went with Stephi and Dominik to Steinheim where we had breakfast with two of her friends who also have children in Dominiks age. It was very nice, but I am quite tired and today is a long day. Ah, complaining complaining ... =P When I came home, the American Au-Pair from Steinheim had called, so I called her back and we talked for 20 minutes. She was really nice and we are going to meet up next Thursday after my german class for a beer.   For those who dont know it already - I am going to a CISV Junior meeting in Hamburg this weekend ! I am really looking forward to it ! So, suddenly I have a packed schedule ... not too bad.

      Its not eleven yet and I feel like I havent slept for decades. I am SO tired and I havent really done anything of signifience today at all, or this weekend in general.  Yesterday I cleaned my room. I think that was all I did of importance yesterday. I woke up at 11 and I felt SO ashamed. I dont really know why but these germans always wake up so early and being Icelandic, I love sleeping in. I had actually set my alarm clock on 9, but it didnt go off. Luckily someone rang the doorbell (when that happens, my phone rings...) so I woke up. And spent the day doing nothing. Its funny, Stephi lived in Brazil for a few years when she was a child and like me, she loves caiparinah, so we had some last night ;) I actually looked at her pictures from Brazil the other day and it was so funny to see her there on the beach in Guaruja (not a big town south of Sao Paulo), the same beach I lived by for 2 weeks summer 1999. Its not a very large world, is it?!  Anyhow, yesterday Stefan did me a favour and called some ppl they know in Steinheim (next town to ours). They have an American Au-Pair, an apparently there is also a French (male) Au-Pair and a Canadian one in the neighbourhood. I am hoping they are nice ppl. I am at least invited to the Halloween Party so they cant be half bad ;)   Today I took care of Dominik while Stephi and Stefan went to the gym and Dominik said his second word in English. The other day he said Dog and today he said Tower (we were building a tower). So, I suppose my English speaking to him is working.  Otherwise I did my homework for German on Tuesday (yeah, I must have a fever to do it SO many days before class but I just didnt have anything better to do), I abused my computer by downloading a whole bunch of music on to it (Thanx Joeri !) and then ate my first dinner here that consisted of meat!!! Of course we drank sect along with it and had some wonderful homemade Amaretto icecream for desert.   And then, I came down here, watched some TV and now.. I am going to bed. Wake up time tomorrow : 6:45. Work begins 7:30.  No mercy ;)  But only 2 hours of work... and the rest of the day OFF !!!  My life could be so much worse =P  Have a good week

      Again, its late - and in general also not so much to share with all of you at the moment. Maybe also because I am tired and lazy and actually have to work tomorrow morning at 9. 4 things I have to say - and "I will say this only once" so listen very carefully.  1) DO sign my guestbook (Ja, eg veit ad thid kikid a thetta reglulega... mig langar samt ad fa stadfestingu a thvi =P ) If you havent found it yet, its right above this entry.  2) FOTO is updated. MR myndir and Pictures from Heidenheim both have some new pictures in. If interested click  urlLink HERE  or click on the link here on your left. Its that easy.   3)  I made an important discovery today. When I dont write e-mails - I dont get e-mails. And what is worse than an empty Inbox? not very many things I can think of ! So - I replied all my e-mails today and I think I have learned my lesson.   4) I hope all of you are having a wonderful weekend !!!!  A big hug for you and a good night for me...

      So, yes. I am a genius ! Sorry to all who think I am being a bit too much right now, but I am just so proud of myself to learn this HTML stuff in 24 hours and already have my links in ! If you are lucky, there will also be a picture page ready when I finish this blog. Or at least a beginning of a picture page !  I spent too much time on here last night and didnt really feel fit this morning. Not that I can say I ever feel fit in the morning, but today was extra bad and for some reason I have had a headache all day. Maybe I should divorce my wonderful computer, or at least separate from it, but I think it would be a seperation I couldnt bear. Humm... not always so cool - being a modern girl ! =)  What did I do today apart from my headache. Well, I woke up late and took care of Dominik from the time he woke up from his nap. In the evening I made my first try at making him dinner - and failed. Luckily Stephi came home just as I was going insane stirring in the pot and worrying that Dominik might starve. For those who are interested and know what I am talking about, Dominik eats somekind of gris for dinner. It is not as thick, svona grautur, mixed with yogurt, fruits or something...  So, apperently I had put too little gris into the warm milk. At least now I know, because tomorrow Stephi and Stefan will be at some dental seminar in Stuttgart when Dominik has dinner so I have to be able to do this.   This evening I went to my language course - and again - didnt really get in contact with anyone. Its so strange sitting there with all those girls who are living the same life as you are as Au-Pairs, but feeling a bit like the your the odd man out because you dont speak Russian !!! I never thought I would consider that to be my main problem in life - not speeking Russian - but it most certainly is at the moment..   Our German teacher showed us something interesting today. A personal ad in the newspaper from an Au-Pair, searching for a contact with another Au-Pair. I called her when I got home and she seemed really nice. Of course she's Russian ;) We talked for a while and then arranged that we would find out our schedules for this weekend and try to meet up. She´s already been here for over a month, knowing nobody. Poor girl... and I am feeling sorry for myself !   Anyhow. It is VERY late and I should be in bed a long time ago. My picture site is up. Lousy so far, but there.

      Just a short one before I formally wake up and take a shower. SO - as clever ppl might have noticed, I got clever yesterday and found out how I can change my template (the way my site looks) with some html stuff. It still looks a bit weird, but I will add a lot more links soon - and a picture page !!! Please be kind and sign my guest book and keep on reading my silly little blog =)

      So, this morning, it was better and I had a good day. You know what I just realised - forrests are SO beautiful. Dominik and I went out for a walk today and walked around in the forrest for some 45 minutes. For a while I was sure I was lost, but I knew that going up hill was further away from home, and down hill closer - so I kept going on that. And I came out in the most unlikely place ever - where I began ! =) It was just so nice. The weather was beautiful, typical fall weather, slightly cold but sunny and different coloured leaves flying all around me as I walked there. For those who are not Icelandic - I must explain that we really dont have that many trees in Iceland. And most certainly not such tall trees ! It was just great. I did feel a bit weird though, so alone with the baby carriage in the forrest, not knowing what lies inbetween all those trees. I just decided to face my fears and walk ahead...  I am actually dealing with a lot of fears right now. My worst fear probably - being afraid of the dark AND living on the groundfloor (I know, you are laughing now, but for me its a dead serious matter), everyones fear of being alone and not knowing anyone - and the in general fear of the unknown.  My god, I sound like such a coward... which I am not. I am just... uhmm... still a little chicken ;) gobble gobble... Back to our wonderful walk, it was just so nice to come inside after almost 2 hours walking outside (we went to visit the goats and then to the park after our trip in the forrest), both with red cheeks and noses and just feel so filled with fresh air, and now to be tired in a healthy way, knowing that I will fall asleep as soon as I lay my head on the pillow.

      Tomorrow is already Thursday again. Hard to believe, but nice in a way. I have my language course twice a week now, tuesdays and thursdays and I havent done my homework for tomorrow yet. I have enough time though tomorrow and wont worry about it now. Right now I am worrying about making my own webpage. About time, dont you think ? Well, I have always wanted to do so, but seeing that it takes forever with a slow internet connection, I have never gotten very far in trying. I promise you will all be the first to know if I succeed :) Yesterday was for some reason pretty hard for me. I got very sad in the evening when I came home from class and ended up sitting here, weeping on the keyboard, trying my best to be strong. Ahem... I didnt quite succeed at that, but I felt better when my mama had called and told me that it was actually OK to cry ;)

      Humm, ha... For those who called me a princess - here is what I did today - all by myself. I took care of Dominik 10 hours, I did the loundry, did the dishes, went out with Dominik for a walk for an hour and a half, did my homework for German, I cleaned around the house, watched the (damned but adorable) cat kill a mouse and yes - I know its not much, but I did what I could around the house and so far, I think I didnt ruine anyones clothes, break or destroy anything so its all good so far. I think . Today was a long day with Dominik, but a good one. His company is enough to keep one occupied, but doesnt make one tired. Tomorrow I wont have to start work until 12:30 and I can pretty much to what I want until then. Most of all of course I would like to SLEEP till noon, but I dont think that would be very much, uhmm, appriciated. Not that it matters. I am SO tired... maybe I should be in bed then, someone out there might be thinking. Maybe thats what I will do now...

      So, yeah, blah... A week has passed here, and it feels kind of strange. Now it is Monday again - and my first day REALLY working. I woke up at 6:45 (did cuddle with my mobile phone, which is also my alarm clock for a while though), took a shower and am actually just waking up now some 4 hours later ! I am not a morning person - I guess that is clear to everyone who know me... The weekend was pretty nice, and quiet. On Saturday I went to the centre on my own for the first time and it was just... odd. I was SO shy.. It is actually really strange to live somewhere where you dont know anyone, you dont really know your way around and you dont really know the language. I had planned to be downtown for a few hours, go to a cafe and just relax... but an hour was quite enough for me and then it was time to go back home.  Which was alright anyways because Stephi´s parents came over for coffee and it was good for me to meet them.  I felt a bit retarded all Saturday long, and was actually quite happy when dinner was over and I was able to crawl into my room, on the couch where I fell asleep. A very rare thing to happen - me falling asleep infront of the TV - but I guess it just shows how tired I am lately.   Yesterday was nice, I had Dominik in the morning and in the afternoon we went swimming in a thermal-swimming pool about half an hour away from here. I dont know why, but for the first time in my life I was ashamed to go out of the dressing room without my towel because I felt fat. Really fat. Its not a nice feeling, that much is true, and I mostly just wanted to wrap my towel around me and sit somewhere in a corner by myself.  Which wasnt optional so I just had to face my fears and be fat. PLEASE dont think that I am fishing for compliments or acting so girly or just being plain annoying. I just wanted to share ...   The last night I watched Forrest Gump and this awful movie Kids. Those who have seen it, know what I am talking about. Its just plain horror in some 90 minutes. Not your ordinary blood and gore, but just this disgusting life of these kids, that is probably (actually for sure) reality in a lot of big cities.But a good movie to watch. I saw it when I was 15 and its been stuck in me since then, even if I didnt understand half of it until last night when I saw it again.   It is my moms BIG birthday today. TIL HAMINGJU MED AFMAELID ELSKU MAMMSAN MIN !!! Bara svo ad thad se alveg a taeru tha ertu BESTUST i ollum heiminum ! Vona ad thu eigir voda kosy dag og skemmtilegt kvold ! küsschen... hab dich lieb =)  Stephi and Stephan are both home for lunch so I better go be social and help around a bit. I hope everyone has a great week !

      So, I have begun to realise that there is actually someone out there who reads this blah of mine. Which is real good, so I will try to keep up and continue to write as I have done so far.  The past 2 days habe been just wonderful. Yesterday was a national holiday so nobody went to work, and I didnt either. In the morning we all had breakfast together and then Stephi, Dominik and I (sjadu mamma, allt fyrir thig;) went bicycling into the centre, just so I could see the way because I will bike to my language course as long as its not too cold.  After a nice lunch we all drove to Ulm, which is the closest city (30 min. by car), walked around the city and Stephan and Stephi showed me all of their "monuments", i.e. where they first met, where he bought her flowers, where they got married, their first apartment etc. We sat down at a cafe and enjoyed the nice weather and drove home in the afternoon. We stopped on the way home on a field filled with appletrees and bought a lot of apples. I have never seen anything like it an I dont mind at all that we had apple cake last night, and today and probably a lot more in the coming days ;)  In the evening Stephan, Stephi and I had a really nice dinner, some wine and then we played a cardgame. I came down here, into my room, feeling very happy and content, and finally relaxed. Nothing to stress about, no worries.   This morning I had Dominik all for myself. We played a bit in my room and then we went outside for a walk with his baby carriage. It was raining - or sort of just a drizzle, but warm and after some 20 minutes Dominik had fallen asleep. He actually went out for a walk again today with his mom and her sister - and again - he fell soundly asleep. Today has been quite and nice and I even got a little nap around noon. Which was very needed because I didnt get enough sleep last night and felt quite besides myself all morning. And I got to study to bit in my very boring Themen Neu german books. BAH !...  Why do such books always have to be the most boring things you´ve ever read? And never up to date.... always some geeky pictures and texts from ´86 that don´t interest anyone anymore (mamma-eg vona ad thu notir thessa bok ekki mjog mikid). Ah, well, I myself chose to take the German course,so I better not complain. The teacher is very nice and I hope they are going to be good classes.

      Gotta love this life. Today I am a happy camper. Life is going good and I am happy to be here. I still miss my mom and home a lot (I watched Icelandic news tonight on the internet and Ive been listening to FM957 and Stereo895 all day long via internet as well) but I think that is completely normal and actually might be healthy as well. Today was really good. Me and Dominik were alone in the morning and again in the afternoon and had a lot of fun together. He is such a wonderful child, so well brought up, so happy, so clever, so content and just a perfect little man. There is never a dull moment with him around, and not a hard one either. He is just an angel and has already melted my heart completely.  The language course last night was really enjoyable even if I did not make contact with the other Au-pairs like I had planned to. I do plan to stick with the Level 2 though. I saw that I had enough to do there last night. Maybe I was just being cocky when I left and thought I already knew a lot of German. I dont know where all my knowledge went... but then again - maybe it was never there to begin with ;)  I did make a "friend" though - an American girl studying in the next town. She was really nice and we already planned to do something next week.  With the other Au-Pairs... well, they are all from Eastern Europe and somehow I felt out, even if that was probably just in my imagination. And they were most a few years younger than me which also puts up an obstacle in my mind, but I know what you are all thinking - the obstacle is only in my stupid head that I should get over as soon as possible. I will - I promise.  Other than that, all is well. Tomorrow is a national holiday so we are all home and going to make a little trip around tomorrow on our bikes. It is good to be here and they are nice people. Anyone who worried, can stop worrying now =) hab euch lieb... schlaf gut !

      Wow, I am tired. My first full day is over and I already feel a lot better than I did yesterday. Dominik was with his grandparents today and me and Stephi had a nice time together. She is just wonderful company. We went to clear my things with the german government, didnt get it all done though so I will do it myself some day soon. We also got me signed up for my German course, which was a little messy. Level 3, the one I wanted to go was cancelled because of no participation. Level 4, the one I should go to is Saturday mornings and we thought that was a dumb time, so I signed up for number 2 and I will go there tomorrow nightI know I might actually understand everything, but I guess its good to get to know ppl and the basics that I am usually failing in are what I should have learned in my first 2 years of German. We will see how it goes... They also have a design course and Stephi and Stefan urged me to take more courses if I wanted to. I would really like to do that. We will also see about that.  Me and Stephi went shopping and then we came home and ate lunch with Stefan. After that I went into my room, got more settled in there (mostly in the computer though) and in the afternoon me and Stephi had tea together... and I told her what I had just found out - That my mom had just bought my ticket and that I WILL be home from the 19th of December till the 5th of January. I feel really bad, having been here less than 24 hours and already having planned my vacation and bought a ticket, but they are understanding, and I am hoping they dont think I dnot like it here, just because this had to happen as soon as possible - and that being today.   I have made my room look really cosy, I have put about 30 pictures of my friends and family above this desk, my favorite pictures of Picasso above the couch and a crucifix above my bed. Put my books  CDs on the shelf and my 2 framed pictures and some more stuff. It already looks like my room and that for me is very important. I dont want to feel like I am a stranger in this house - and Stephan  Stephi most certainly dont treat me like that. Oh, yeah, and Stephan put his music program on my computer with some 400 CDs on it. I cant say I disliked that gesture :)  But, I think its time to go to bed and leave anyone who reads this ... ;) sweet dreams

      What a nice day ! I am supposed to work until 6, but Stefan came home at 5 so my work is done ! And I've actually done so much today. First I vacuumed the house, then I cleaned my room (which was VERY needed), made this blog look a bit more interesting and then Dominik woke up from his nap. We went for a walk, I put 2 letters in the mail and then we took our normal round. As usually we went to visit the cows at the farm, and as we were saying "ciao, ciao" to the cows, I saw something even more interesting and couldn't help bursting out laughing.  Suddenly there were chickens running around on the lawn infront of us ! A bunch of orange roosters, eating grass and jumping around =) Not really what I expected to see on our quiet afternoon walk... but then again... this place is full of surprises ! Heidenheim is a funny place. Tonight there's an American band playing at K2 and there was a small article about it in the newspaper this morning that says it all: "It doesn't happen very often, that an American band looses it's way into Heidenheim - and furthermore a pretty good band..." Yeah, I live in the middle of nowhere ! I come from Iceland... I know what I'm talking about =P     Come on ! Give me just one smile... it's healthy =)     urlLink  postCount('tuttugu');  Please express yourself !

        Íslendingasögur    Sit hér og drekk morgunkaffið mitt (drekk núorðið bara einn bolla á dag!) og slappa af eftir að hafa ryksugað húsið. Ég er farin að hallast sterklega að því að í Þýskalandi séu einhverjir súper ryk-kraftar á ferð, því það er verulega ótrúlegt hvað mikið ryk getur safnast út um allt á einni viku, og virkilega, það eru þykkar rykklessur og vefir, þótt við séum mikil snyrtimenni og að hér sé allt þrifið hátt og lágt á hverjum fimmtudegi.  Er í rauninni mjög þakklát fyrir að vera hér og sjá hvernig ég vil ekki lifa ef mér tekst einhvern tímann að ná mér í mann og eignast börn. Mér finnst einhvern veginn hálf úrkynjað að hafa eina manneskju sem býr á heimilinu, þvær þvottinn, tekur til og passar barnið, og aðra sem kemur og þrífur fyrir þig. Jú, þetta er voða kósý, enda koma þau bara heim og dúllast með Dominik, elda huggulegan mat, drekka rauðvín og lifa hinu ljúfa lífi.    (hamingjubros =) gerði smá pásu því ég var að fá bréf frá Marie ! Fyrir þá sem þekkja hana þá líður henni vel á Grikklandi þar sem hún er Erasmus stúdent og er bara nokkuð hress)   Aftur að málefni dagsins. Ég hef aldrei þrifið mikið um ævina og eiginlega er ég bara algjört letidýr og dekurrassgat - en, ég er myndi samt aldrei getað hugsað mér að hafa ókunnugt fólk í vinnu við að þvo fötin mín og þrífa mín óhreinindi. Bara ekki alveg minn stíll einhvern veginn. En, eins og áður segir, þá er ég voða glöð að Stephi og Stefan vilja hafa þetta svona, því annars væri ég ekki hér hjá þeim .. og án þess myndi ég alls ekki vilja vera !  Annars er ég bara kát. Var alveg hroðalega þreytt í gær - sem er kannski ekkert skrýtið þar sem ég vinn alla daga og er svo úti öll kvöld. Fór semsagt ekkert í gærkvöldi og lá í staðinn bara hrjótandi upp í sófa fyrir framan imbakassann.  Átti langt og gott samtal við Stefan á mánudaginn, þar sem að ég sagði honum allt sem væri að trufla mig í okkar samskiptum og hann baðst afsökunar, sagðist skilja hvað ég væri að meina og hann ætlar semsagt að bæta sig. Enda eru hlutirnir búnir að vera miklu betri okkar á milli sl. daga.   Átti að vera að fara með fjölskyldunni á svona bændagistingu (bóndabær sem er líka hótel) um helgina en ákvað að vera bara heima í staðinn. Meika ekki alveg að fara burtu alla þessa helgi, og alla næstu helgi og svo kemur ein helgi og svo fer ég heim til Íslands. Það er semsagt alveg nóg að gera hér, og eins og sumum er kannski orðið ljóst eyði ég eiginlega öllum mínum frítíma með fransmanninum sem er ekki kærastinn minn =) Það er ótrúlega þægileg tilfinning að vera búin að eignast svona reglulega góðan vin, einhvern sem vill alltaf hitta þig, nennir alltaf að hlusta á þig, og ég get hlegið með og yfirleitt bara skemmt mér mjög vel með, jafnvel þótt við hittumst daglega !  Meðmæli dagsins :  urlLink Heimildarmynd um einelti  Kíktu á þetta ef þú ert með sæmilega nettenginu.   Jæja, ég ætla að fara og svara E-mailum eða taka til hérna inni hjá mér.

      Hey everyone =) Just finished working, had an awesome afternoon with Dominik. We danced around the living room, drank tea together, practiced his English and then we went out for a walk in the pooring rain. Made a close encounter with a swan on our journey... what a beautiful creature ! I am going to my language course in half an hour, and then going out with my very nice friends ... once again to drink beer..  =P  I added 2 new photo's of me and Dominik to  urlLink FOTO  . Just click  urlLink   here     to take a look !      urlLink  postCount('átján');  You got something to say tell me ?

      Yet another Monday and another funny weekend passed by. Was a pretty hectic weekend with a lot of things to do and a lot of things happening in my head. Sometimes I wonder why I can't have a simple life, but then again - I don't think I would survive a simple life for very long. It gets too boring.   Thursday my television died. Didn't really care much 'cause I haven't had much time to watch TV lately anyways, but when Stephi and Stefan got home on Fridaynight at midnight after going to a movie, they brought me a new TV. I'd call that service... ;) Went out with Etienne on Fridaynight after work (we got into town about a quarter to one) and we went to a club to listen to some "männer" music.  I did get to hear Björk there as well, which was really cool. Got home half past 4, an hour before Dominik woke up... On Saturday I went to town, bought some paper and stuff to decorate my Christmas gifts - and to make Christmas cards if I decide to send some. And of course, I sat down at Melange and had a beer in good company.   Saturdaynight I worked again, decorated some Christmas gifts and then went out when Stephi and Stefan got home. We went to a bar called Stattgarten and I don't think I've laughed this much in months ! Bavaria had apperantly won some soccer game (don't ask...) and the people were going insane. German music playing loudly, beer flowing every where, people dancing on the tables, taking off their clothes, throwing down the lights in the ceiling ... and I laughed so hard I almost fell off my chair. I don't think I have ever seen anything so German and so funny ! It really gave me the longing to go to Octoberfest ! I must someday !  Yesterday I cannot say did anything of concequence. Yes, I went to a café, had brunch and read about 5 ELLE magazines and felt quite braindead. Came home, had "a bit" of a crisis with my host family (well, actually things have been weird for a while now)- which made my Sunday even worse. I don't like Sundays as you might all know by now, and yesterday was   a very bad example   . Solved that crisis this morning and am feeling a lot better now. One headache less.   Today I looked after Dominik my usual 2 hours in the morning, and was a bit sad to see him leave with his grandfather because I have seen so little of him this weekend and have started to miss that little guy. And Stephi and Stefan are going to Ulm tonight so he's staying the night by his grandparents and I've been having an  only the lonely   Monday by myself.  Spent an hour in the bookstore reading the Guiness Book of World Records. Yeah, I guess I had another braindead day today, but one cannot always be up and going. Sometimes one just needs to do nothing.   Anyhow, I am starving and I have some very nice food waiting to be prepared and a lovely Tiramisu waiting as desert. mmmm... lecker, lecker, lecker!    urlLink  postCount('sautján');  You got something to say tell me ?

      It's official. Christmas is coming up and I have started listening to Christmas songs now. Just came back from Ulm after buying most of the Christmas presents and suddenly the mood hit me. BIG SMILE =) I love Christmas... too bad I don't have any of my Christmas decorations with me here ... I'll have to do something about that !    urlLink  postCount('fimmtán');  You got something to say tell me ?

       Það er pirrandi að vera pirraður !  Einhvern veginn er þetta ekki alveg minn dagur. Þetta er einn af þessum dögum þar sem það er best að láta mig bara vera, því ég gæti mjög auðveldlega snúið öllu upp í rifrildi og skyndilega orðið mjög leiðinleg.  Stefan er að taka mig á taugum. Viljandi, held ég.  Það er eiginlega leiðinlegt hvað ég er pirruð á honum því hann er í raun mjög skemmtilegur og ef hann léti ekki eins og 15 ára og hætti kannski að "bögga" mig í smá stund, gætum við kannski orðið góðir félagar.  Hann veit allt best, nöldrar ef einhver er ekki sammála honum, og hættir vanalega ekki fyrr en hin manneskjan er orðin fúl. Svo er hann með kynferðisleg komment í minn garð meira en ég get þolað (og ég á yfirleitt ekkert að þurfa að hlusta á svona kjaftæði !), en ég hef hingað til ekki svarað fyrir mig.  Svo fer það í taugarnar á mér að Stephi fór í fýlu út í mig á sunnudaginn af því að baðherbergið mitt var ekki tandurhreint. Og hún var virkilega fúl og þetta er virkilega búið að vera til umræðu á heimilinu. Ég tek það fram að ég er með sérbað niðri hjá mér... og að Stephi er með manneskju sem þrífur hennar baðherbergi hátt og lágt einu sinni í viku! Hún þrífur sitt bað ekki einu sinni sjálf. Stundum eru þau einum of...   Ég veit einhvern veginn aldrei hvað þau segja næst og hvort þau eru ánægð með mig eða ekki. Okkur kemur jú voða vel saman og allt það, en upp á síðkastið er búið að vera dálítið stress í gangi á milli okkar. Mér líður alltaf miklu betur þegar þau eru ekki heima og ég þarf ekki að tala við þau.   Ég er að reyna að vera bara róleg og láta þetta ekki taka mig á taugum. Það gengur ekkert voða vel. Ég held líka að það sé komin tími til að ég stingi sokk upp í munninn á Stefan því ég er orðin hundleið á því hvernig hann leyfir sér að tala við mig. Hvað finnst ykkur að ég eigi að gera?    urlLink  postCount('sextán');  Segðu mér þína skoðun!

      Good morning ! Yeap, it's 10 in the morning and I am up. Amazing, isn't it?! Already finished vaccuming our house and dusting the living room.  See, my host family has a cleaner who comes Thursday mornings and I help her out. I sometimes wonder how normal families survive and especially how my mom survived as a single parent, with 3 kids and without an Au-Pair and without a cleaner ;)  I've been wondering if I would like to live like this when I grow up, i.e. if I have the money to do so, and I don't think I would. Isn't it a part of having a home and a family to clean, do your own laundry and stuff like that? Not that I am complaining... I am very grateful to be here and get to work for this particular family !  It's already Thursday and it has really started to amaze me how fast time passes around here. At first it didn't, but now it is flying away and within a month I will be at home for my Christmas vacation =) But I suppose things are different now from what they were my first month here, now I am quite busy and am never really home when I am not working.  On that subject, I went to visit Etienne yesterday afternoon and he happens to live on the other side of town. Stefan  Stephi drove me there 'cause they were on their way to town, but then I had to get myself home around 6. I waited for the bus, it came, and drove pass me ! I was kindof in a hurry to get home because I had to work at 7:30 so I decided to walk downtown and take the bus home from there.  When I got downtown, there were no busses to where I live so I kept walking... 50 minutes after I left Etienne's house, I was home. It really wasn't that bad, the weather was nice and I had my CD player with me.    But   from now on, I am going to make the bike my best friend. Travelling by bus in this town is painful ! Expensive and painful !  Tomorrow I have the day off and I am going with Stephi and Dominik to Ulm (next big city). I am going to do some sightseeing and maybe a bit of shopping. Saturday I am going back to Ulm to do some serious Christmas shopping and relaxing.  I don't have so much time the coming weekends, so I decided to get this done and over with.   By the way - for anyone living on my continent and who has 6.-8.December off, click here  urlLink  NaJuWo Hamburg 2002   It's going to be an awesome weekend with A LOT of very nice people (including myself :), but please note that you must sign up before the 24th !   Well, I am going to stop now and go do my 300 pages of homework for my class tonight. Boring boring boring...     urlLink  postCount('fimmtán');  You got something to say tell me ?

      So, I am back. Here to keep my promise. First I'd like to express my personal worries of excessive beer drinking on my behalf. Seriously, it's become a problem, but German beer is so good, so cheap (or free when I drink it at home) and always available, so why say no?! I mean, that's what I am supposed to do in Germany, drink beer, right? =) Second of all, I do not know if I will keep my promise about the Icelandic update today. I found out that there's a little french man out there who has a hidden talent and actually understood that I was talking about him in my last blog in Icelandic.  Thumbs up for Etienne =P   What I have been up to... Day time I work. Very simple. Wednesday evening last week me and Olga actually ended up going to town for a beer, Thursday evening I went out with Briget, Etienne and Briget's boyfriend for some pool, darts and beer and Friday me and Etienne went to visit our friends Tim and Michael in Würzburg [Bavaria].  Michael actually originally invited us over there but landed in the hospital for an appendix removal on Wednesday so we only got to visit him in the hospital on Saturday. Not very nice, but we'll get another chance to visit him for sure !  We left Heidenheim an hour after I finished working and were in Würzburg shortly after eight in the evening. What joy it was to get to a big city. What pure joy. Actually not so much was going on downtown when we got there, but then again, we're in Germany and Würzburg,Bayern might not be the most   happening   city of them all. But above all, it was a city, we found a bar where we had a beer and then we met Tim around half past 9, and went out together later that evening.   Saturday we slept long, went on a guided tour through the Residenze (that used to be the residence of some royalities, and looks like a small version of Versailles), walked around town, had a coffee, saw the Main, and a WWII museum.  In the evening Tim cooked a really nice dinner for us and of course we all went out for a beer that evening. Sunday we spent at the apartment doing nothing... listening to music, being stupid, eating and ... playing Yatzee in the end.   As I said before we came home around 10, last night was really crappy but today was fine ["Yesterday was dramatic, today is ok" a cool quote everyone who's anyone should recognize =P] and I have a billion and five hours of work this week, which isn't so cool.  Even have to work Friday and Saturdaynight until 11 in the evening, which stinks worst of all, but I am still planning to go out, somehow, somewhere, with someone ! Any volunteers??    urlLink  postCount('þrettán');     Íslendingar ... þ.e. þeir sem lafa enn við lesturinn.. maðurinn frá landi alpahúfanna á semsagt kærustu. Komst ég að í gærkvöldi. Ég var nokkuð pirruð en er búin að jafna mig og í staðinn búin að ákveða að við verðum bara góðir vinir, því við náum ótrúlega vel saman og erum eiginlega búin að liggja í hláturskasti alla helgina. Á þessum tímapunkti er góður vinur gulls ígildi =) og mun mikilvægara að eiga einn slíkan heldur en kærasta eða eitthvað í þá áttina. Þjóðverjinn sem var svo hrifinn af mér er semsagt sá sem liggur á spítala eftir botnlangakast og það var í hreinskilni sagt nokkuð pínlegt að heimsækja hann. Sumir lifa aldrei sérlega einföldu lífi .. en það er spennandi og gaman hjá mér og eins og stendur skiptir það mestu máli !  So, that's was it for me. It's only a bit passed 11, but I am exhausted and I wanna crawl into my bed and regain a bit more energy. Sweet dreams :)    urlLink  postCount('fjórtán');

      Hey everyone. Have a bunch of things to do this afternoon so I am going to keep it short for now. Got home from my very nice weekend in Würzburg around 10 last night, so I am a bit tired and so, but I promise I will write something tonight (og smá update á íslensku líka) and tell you a bit about what I've been up to for the past few days.  I have been a bit lazy lately, blogging, but well, I've got a bit more of a life here now than I did about a month ago, when I blogged every day. The non-Icelandic speakers out there have to excuse the fact that there might be a bit in Icelandic coming up again - but anyone who really wants a translation can feel free to write me and ask for one ! I promise to say yes =) Well, have to go grocery shopping and then I am going to town. Wish you all a good week.     urlLink  postCount('tólf');

       Frekari tjáningar þörf  Ég geri mér fyllilega grein fyrir að ég blaðra alltof mikið og það nennir engin að lesa þetta allt til enda, á tveimur tungumálum. Það slæma er að mér er næstum farið að standa á sama því mér finnst einstaklega gaman að dreifa mínu prívatlífi svona um alnetið.  Þetta hlýtur að vera einhverskonar athyglisþörf að brjótast fram hjá mér. Svo sem ekki algengt þegar ég á í hlut, þannig að ég geri ráð fyrir að þetta sé í lagi. Ykkur er amk. alveg sama... held ég =) eða hvað?   urlLink  postCount('tíu');     Átti nokkuð langan dag, byrjaði að vinna klukkan hálf átta og Stefan kom heim rúmlega hálf sex. Er aðallega slubbuleg því ég svaf mjög illa - og lítið, í nótt og var bara fegin þegar ég þurfti að vakna, og nóttin var á enda.   Ég sagði ykkur í síðasta bloggi, fyrir nákvæmlega viku, frá ungum þjóðverja sem var svo óheppin að verða skotin í mér. Ég gat því miður ekki endurgoldið skotið - þótt að mér líkaði mjög vel við viðkomandi og gæti vel hugsað mér hann sem félaga.  Svo varð  ég  svo (ó)heppin á sunnudaginn að verða formlega skotin í fransmanni (sem er líka Au-Pair) úr vinahópnum, og hann í mér.Ég hef ekki hugmynd um hvert þetta skot leiðir okkur, en ég og sá franski erum a.m.k. að fara að heimsækja unga þjóðverjann og aðra félaga okkar í Bæjaralandi um helgina. Annað kemur bara í ljós...   Telst ótrúlegt að ég hafi komið allri sögunni í 5 línur, en stundum... bara stundum, þegar ég reyni verulega á mig tekst mér að vera stuttorð.  Það er hinsvegar mjög sjaldgæft og ég mæli með því að fólk njóti þess þegar það gerist =)  (ég sé bros á nokkrum núna, sem þekkja mitt "... og svo...og þá... og ég sagði... og þá.. og... þú skilur...veistu...æi, blah... og bara..." )  Þetta er svo dæmigert, annaðhvort sést ekki karlmaður í 100 km radíus frá manni í lengri tíma, eða þeir detta allir inn í líf manns í sömu vikunni og maður situr eftir, alveg ringlaður. Ég er samt að vona hlutirnir verði einfaldari hér eftir.   Jæja, ætla að fara að taka til og gera kósý hérna. Olga ætlar að koma í heimsókn á eftir. Henni kemur því miður ekkert of vel saman við sína fjölskyldu, og gat ömögulega hugsað sér að vera heima hjá sér í kvöld. Sem er alveg fyrirgefanlegt, þar sem ég hef ekkert á móti smá selskap :)  Þökkum stuðninginn  Góðar stundir    urlLink  postCount('ellefu');

      It's been a while ... I guess it is time I sit down and really write something of consequence.   The weekend was definetly not one of the easiest weekends of my life. Fridaynight I had such troubles falling asleep because I was so afraid of EVERYTHING ... and fortunatly Dominik was nice and didn't wake up until 8:30 the next morning, which is something that never happens.  Saturday we went to his great-grandmothers birthday party, held at his grandparents place. It was funny going alone with Dominik, not having Stephi and Stefan around, and being surrounded by this family - with whom you are somehow linked but have never met before.  The cakes were nice and Stephi has a really nice younger sister who sort of "held my hand" through this enjoyable family experience =)  Saturdaynight after Dominik went to bed, I watched TV, talked on the phone and tried desperately to fall asleep, with very little success. I can hardly say I slept at all that night. I was so scared that I was nauseated beyond belief and there was no way I could turn off the light.  And of course, Dominik had to wake up at 6:30, just for my enjoyement, on Sundaymorning. The morning passed somehow, and after Dominik's nap his grand-dad came and picked him up 'cause I had plans for the evening.  A friend picked me up at 8 and we went to a party in Steinheim, a village about 15 minutes away from here. It was very nice to meet friends, laugh, dance and drink a cold beer and just relax and have nothing to worry about.   Monday I didn't have work and I can't really say I did anything .. I talked on the phone a lot, which is always nice =) My friend Brynhildur is an Au-Pair in Italy as many may know and I can call her for 2 cents a minute, which of course makes me call her every week for an hour. I love my telephone... I just have to admit it. Especially after I redecorated my room and moved the phone from my desk to a small coffee-table next to my couch, so discomfort does not disturb my phone conversations anymore.   And Monday I fell asleep infront of the TV around 10, moved to my bed around midnight and slept... until 12:35 next day !!! I am not going to describe how ashamed I was when I came upstairs and Stephi and Stefan were sitting there, having eaten lunch, drinking an espresso. Fortunatly they are very nice people, they smiled and asked if I didn't need an espresso as well =) Seeing that I probably slept about 18 hours Thursday - Monday, it might not be so surprising that I was tired.   Yesterday I went to my language course and after it I went to a café with Olga, where we sat for 2 hours, talked  drank a beer or two. We get along real well and it was really nice to sit with her and just talk about everything and nothing, and it was nice to realise how much we have in common.   Anyhow, I feel like writing some E-mails at the moment, so I will do that... hope everyone is having a good week =)    urlLink  postCount('níu');

      What shall I say. It's Fridaynight, I just finished putting Dominik to bed and when I finish writing this entry I will go and heat some dinner for myself. I won't lie to all of you and say I am going to cook - because I am not and have no interest in doing so =) it's just.. not my thing somehow.  Stephi and Stefan are away for the entire weekend and I probably won't see them until Monday because I am going out on Sundaynight and will probably be gone before they come home.  Started working at 7 this morning, slept when Dominik had his afternoon nap and then we went out for a long walk in the afternoon. It is really strange being alone in this big house and I cannot say I am very fond of it. As some people know I am afraid of the dark, and I don't really like being alone over night in such a big house. Sure, I survive, I just don't feel good, but probably all of this is good for me, because I will probably have to live on my own someday... when I grow up ;) The week has been alright. Been working a lot and haven't done many interesting things, except for going to a café with 4 other "girls" from my German class on Tuesdaynight. That was pretty nice, even if I sat with the American woman for 2 hours and talked to her in English and the 3 girls from Eastern Europe sat for those same 2 hours and talked Russain with each other. I swear, me and the American woman tried to speak German at first, but the other 3 always had to add something to each other in Russian so in the end we just gave up. Which was fine by me actually, because we had a really interesting conversation, and it was really enjoyable to have a intellectual conversation with someone in a language you can communicate pretty well in. Sometimes I do get pretty annoyed, not being able to reply proporly or say something the way I want to say it.   Which reminds me of the dream I had last night, I dreamt that I pumped into 2 Icelandic girls downtown and that they got me in contact with a bunch of Icelanders that lived around here. In the end of that dream, I was sitting at a party with all those Icelanders, talking.  I must say I enjoyed that dream... even if I am not here to find Icelandic friends and to talk Icelandic all the time.  Plus - I have my sister for that. The poor girl gets a call from me almost every day and has to listen to me blabber and complain. She really has all my sympathy, I admire how well she's dealing  with it, and as I said to her yesterday - she should just be honored, she's a subsitute mom. Since I can't call my mom everyday, and since my sister lives in Germany and is really nice too  - I just have to call her every day instead =) Makes a whole lot of sense, doesn't it?! Ég ætla annars að gefa þér frí í kvöld Stína mín og leyfa þér að knúsa manninn þinn í friði og ró ;)  Well, I am going to grab my glasses and go upstairs to "enjoy" the solitude of this evening... If anyone want's to come visit, you are more than welcome !    urlLink  postCount('átta');

        Íslendingasögur   Liðið of langt síðan ég tjáði mig aðeins á ástkæra ylhýra. Svo er líka ágætt að blaðra dálítið á móðurmálinu þegar maður vill ekki að útlendingarnir á svæðinu skilji mann.. =P  Fór raunar inn til mín til að læra heima en lenti á  urlLink www.tyskopgaver.dk  og gerði nokkrar æfingar þar og er búin að fá nóg af þýskunni í bili. Stephi er búin að hlæja mikið að mér í dag, því einhverra hluta vegna tekst mér ekki að tala enskulausa þýsku í dag.  Ég er ekkert sérlega vel sofin - er að vona að það sé þessvegna. Sagði " You  hast..." og " She   war da". Ég rugla tungumálunum ekkert saman þannig (annað með dönskuna og þýskuna.. ég er alveg fötluð í dönsku núna !), stundum veit munnurinn á mér bara ekki alveg hvaða tungumál ég er að tala og ber þýskuna fram með einhverjum afkáralegum enskum hreim. Það skal annars tekið fram að Dominik á að verða tvítyngdur þannig að ég tala alltaf ensku við hann þegar við erum ein, þannig að það er kannski ekkert svo undarlegt að ég ruglist af og til.    Fór á kaffihús í gær með samnemendum mínum eftir þýskutímann í gær. Talaði eiginlega allt kvöldið við bandaríska konu sem er gift Þjóðverja. Þau áttu í tveggja og hálfs árs fjarsambandi meðan hún kláraði námið og eru búin að vera gift í ár. Eins og gefur að skilja gátum við talað lengi og vel um fjarsambönd og mér fannst mjög athyglisvert að hitta einhvern sem hefur staðið í sömu sporum og ég var í ... og að það hafi gengið upp.  Aðdáunarvert í rauninni, því mér finnst svona fjarsambönd ekkert voða sniðug og tel mig nú tala af reynslu. Hún benti mér á að maður myndi gera ýmislegt fyrir sanna ást. Ég benti henni á á móti að sönn ást myndi samt ekki fá mig til að flytjast búferlum til Ameríku, þótt mér hafi líkað mjög vel þar og líki enn alveg prýðilega við minn fyrrverandi í Texas.   Talandi um karlmenn. Svona okkar á milli, var helgin eitt langt stefnumót. Mjög fyndið eiginlega, því eins og allir vita er orðið  stefnumót  ekki í orðabók Íslendinga, a.m.k. ekki hjá Íslendingum í mínum aldursflokki, og ég vissi tæplega hvernig ég átti að haga mér og taka þessu öllu saman.  Ég hlýt engu að síður að hafa gert eitthvað rétt því deitið skrifaði mér sms í gærkvöldi og  spurði  "hvort hann mætti hringja í mig í dag, og þá hvenær". Þarf að biðja um leyfi til að taka upp tólið og stimpla inn númerið mitt? Mér fannst þetta, eins og þetta mál allt saman, afar skondið. Sú ameríska sem ég talaði við í gærkvöldi sagði líka að þjóðverjar tækju þennan stefnumóta prósess mjög alvarlega.

      Back, after a very nice  enjoyable dinner. Now my homework awaits me, but before I sink my teeth into that horrid book of mine, I have a few things more to say.  First of all, we had some pictures developed today and Stefan is going to download the pictures of me and Dominik soon so I can updated  urlLink Foto  very soon.  Secondly, and very importantly,  I want to remind everyone to USE THE COMMENT LINK ! Some people (raunar alveg dásamlega sætar konur tvær) have used my guestbook as a venue for comments and stuff they wanna tell me. Please, click on the comment link and tell me something nice ;) I promise to reply. Last but not least I just want to mention that I ... yeah...send all of you a smile and hope you all have a great week.

      It's raining and cold outside but somehow it's been the best Monday I have had in a long time. I love my Monday's with a passion, but this one was extra good. I took care of Dominik for my usual 2 hours and then when his grandparents had picked him up, I slept while the washing machine did my laundry.  So, I woke up for the second time at noon, even if I slumbered infront of the TV from 10 O'Clock last night. But there's an explanation for why I was so tired. This has formally been the most hectic, but most fun weekend I've had since I moved here. Saturday, after I managed to write my last entry, I went to town... and came home at 4 in the morning.  What did I do for those 12 hours you are probably asking yourselves...  I went to Melange, had lunch/dinner, had a beer or two and wrote a 10 page letter to my Marie, who is now living in Greece. At 6 I met up with Marina, the Au-Pair from Russia. We went to another café, had a beer and talked until we were picked up and went to the movies with very nice new found friends. Afterwards we went to a bar and had a beer or two, and then to a club where we again... had a beer or two.  So, I got home at 4 in the morning and woke up at 8:30 to work. I can only say that I did not feel very pleasant and I most certainly did not look very fresh or "ausgeschlafen". Sunday afternoon I went to drink coffee with those very nice new found friends of mine, mentioned above, came home and ate a lovely dinner with Stephi and Stefan and then slept infront of the TV. In fewer words - a wonderful Sunday =) A very nice way to unwind after having one too many beers over the weekend.   After I woke up for the second time today, I went to town and ran some errands for myself and Stephi, as well as buying myself shoes I have been dreaming of for the last two weeks. And a wonderful pair of fleece around-the-house shoes for 5 Euros. Seeing that I now live on the first floor and that I have a wooden floor - it doesn't work to be barefeeted like I usually am at home in Iceland.   Somehow I finally got the feeling of really living here today. I have started to know my way around, I can communicate with the people around me with out making too many mistakes or sounding too foreign, I actually don't really mind the rain anymore and I know what busses to take now.  And last but not least... I got my Aufenhaltserlaubnis für Angehörige eines Mitgliedsstaates der EU today [my residence permit]. It is a wonderful green pamphlet with the German eagle on the front - my info and picture inside. Valid until 29.09.2003. It's just funny, suddenly being an official immigrant. I don't know why. It just is.   But, now it is dinner time and I have to get a new bottle cachacha for the caiparinah so I will very gladly leave =P    urlLink  postCount('fjórir');

      It's amazing isn't it, I haven't written anything since Tuesday. I actually decided to give my blog a rest for a few days because I was worried I was suffocating all of you with my continous writing. I would have actually written something yesterday, but I was dead  gone all day and only turned on the computer once, which for me is something very unusal.  So... I will share with you what I have been doing lately.  Tuesdaynight I went out with Briget (the American Au-Pair) and we had a nice evening at café Melange. Wednesday was pretty quiet, I worked most of the day and all evening as well.  Thursday I sort of had off. Seeing that Thursday is in some parts of Germany a national holiday, Stephi's secretary hadn't booked any patients for that day, so we had a kosy day here.  I went to town though and ran some errands, sat at Melange, read the paper and had a beer and then got a nice sightseeing tour around Heidenheim... I took the wrong bus ! I did catch the right bus in the end, after going to the library again and picking up 4 more books in English. I read "The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood" this week. It's some 500 pages but one can almost say I ate it. Sure, it's no exquisit literature, but it was a very, very enjoyable read. I wanted to see the movie, but now I don't know anymore. The book was so nice that I cannot imagine that the movie could be better. Especially not with Sandra Bullock in the leading roll. I somehow don't like that woman.   Anyhow. Thursdaynight is actually the interesting part. I was invited to a Halloween Party. Briget's host family has an annual Halloween party and Stefan and Stephi dressed me up in Stefan's clothes from the navy (matrósarföt) and I must say I looked pretty cute, in that white shirt, with the blue collar and the white hat, in kneelength pants and my army boots.  I was really stressed as we got there, which is pretty understandable seeing that I didn't know a soul there except for Briget.  Oh, I had so much fun !!! I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Stefan was going to pick me up at 11:30 but I got some guys to promise they would bring me home when they left. They left at 2, and at that time I was going insane on the dancefloor and didn't want to leave at all. So, one of Briget's friends said I could spend the night at his place. I said OK, having had one too many cocktails but also, Briget's friends were really nice and friendly and I didn't want to leave so I just thought... what the hell !  We left the party at 5:30. What can I say? It was a great party =) I stayed with 2 of Briget's friends, actually shared a bed with one of them, but I fell asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow and woke up at 1 the next day. As I said to my mom yesterday - if anything happened, I most certainly missed it ! I actually woke up with my mobile phone ringing. It was my mom. Quite funny waking up with your mom calling, having no idea where you are, what you are doing there and who that person next to you is ;)  The 3 of us ate pancakes for breakfast and then I was driven home. I got home around 3, went straight to bed and slept until 7 in the evening. It wasn't quite my day - but then everyone who knows that side of me also knows that I shouldn't drink because I always get the worst hangovers. Sometimes it's worth it though. This was definetly an evening I wouldn't have wanted to miss.    urlLink  postCount('fjórir');

      Unbelievable but true ! I am blogging ! It's been quite a while, but as I've stated before, blogging isn't the easiest thing in the world around here.  Tomorrow is a new year and today is the last day of this year.  New Years Eve being my favorite, but most melancholic evening, I am having mixed feeling towards it - good feelings because it's going to be SO much fun tonight, and confused feelings because I don't know what the new year has instored for me.  No doubt I will find out. This year has flown by and I have a feeling this year will as well.  But, I also have a feeling that I will have a good year. An important year somehow.   I don't feel like making this any longer for now, so I am just going to wish you all a HAPPY NEW YEAR and hope and pray that 2003 will fulfill all your dreams and give you all the joy you so truly deserve.     urlLink  postCount('fertig');   Gledilegt nytt ar !!!

      As you might notice, I am not as much by the computer as I usually am, but that is easily explained with the fact that I am home with my crappy computer and our crappy internet connection... and I am quite busy as well, which also explains a lot.  I'm doing alright, my Christmas spirit somehow got exchange with a Christmas sadness today, which isn't necessarily bad, it's just... different.  So many things have happened this past year, and I guess it's no wonder that my mind is flying a bit, trying to sort out all the things that I have experienced in these past 12 months.   But... Christmas is tomorrow and I cannot wait. I finally decided what to wear for tomorrow night, and it's quite unorthodox, but it's comfortable and I think it's pretty. Finally I'm wearing something wide and comfortable for Christmas Eve... which also means I can eat AS MUCH as I want ;) And seeing that my mom is cooking a huge turkey and there's only 4 of us, I think that will be needed :)  Our Christmas tree is up, but not decorated yet. That's my job for tomorrow when I get home from work at one. All the presents are ready though, mine looking very nice, and I even got to wrap some for Kristín and Volker as well. It takes me an average of an hour and a half to wrap a present and decorate it and I am beginning to think it's somekind of personal masocism of mine, because it only takes 30 seconds to unwrap it... Maybe you can look at it as an artform or my way of expressing myself.  I don't really care, I don't find it useless and to be honest, I really enjoy it, even if I am also working at the florist's right now, wrapping more presents than I can count.   It's getting late and I have to get up at 8 tomorrow morning.   I wish you all a very merry Christmas and a joyful time with your families and friends.     urlLink  postCount('jolasaga');   Gleðileg jól !!!

       HOME  That's where I am ... and that's what I am VERY happy about at the moment. It's so good to be home, even if I also feel that I don't live here anymore.  The trip from Heidenheim to Iceland was alright, I'd slept 3 hours the night before so I was quite tired, but nevertheless, it was nice because in Frankfurt I met 2 icelandic friends and the 3 of us flew home together.   Last night I went to a Coldplay concert and it was just ... AMAZING. Oh, it was so cool =)  Today I slept until 2:30 and then went to Goethe Institut's Christmas Party with my family. Nice company and some glühwein. Not too bad ! But now I think my family is waiting for me 'cause we want to watch a film so I better go. I don't know how much I'll blog while I'm home because I will start working at the florist's tomorrow at 10 and when I'm not working I'll be pretty busy, but I hope I can blog a bit nevertheless.

       urlLink  wow...so many ppl have checked my blog today and I feel real guilty that I haven't written anything of concequence in a while. A while being a few days, but nevertheless. I actually tried to write earlier today, but somehow I fell on my keyboard and suddenly all I'd written was gone. Don't ask :) Anyhow, takk til mömmu, Kristínar og  urlLink Guju  fyrir að hringja í kvöld. Mig langaði SVO að heyra í ykkur þremur en var á kaffihúsi og er þar að auki að díla við að lækka símreikninginn, þannig að... ég held að hér hafi verið hugsanaflutningur á ferð.Takk... og... ÉG HLAKKA TIL AÐ SJÁ YKKUR !!!   Things are good. I'm a little stressed at the moment because I haven't packed much yet and tomorrow will RUN away from me, but I am so excited about going home and it won't matter so very much if I forget my toothbrush and a T-shirt or two. I'm going home in 36 hours and that is all that's important.  I've managed to wrap almost all my Christmas presents by now, but realised 2 days ago that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to wrap them before I go home, because I don't know if my decorative wrapping will survive the trip from here to Frankfurt and from Franfurt to Garðabær. One just has to hope and pray, because I also know I won't have any time to do decorative, artistic wrapping when I get home...  Well, what have I been doing in the past few days... spending lots of time with the  urlLink frenchman , because he's leaving me.. .and Germany, desperately trying to get my stuff done and ready before I leave and of course WORKING =)  Actually, I had a horrid problem with the bank yesterday. I'm still a bit traumatized after that experience. Having bank problems is hard enough in your own language, let alone in German ! My mom put 150 Euros in my account so I run some errands (one of those being buying my ticket to Frankfurt Airport) and half an hour after she put it on my account, I went to the ATM (geldautomat/hraðbanki) to take it out. I asked for 120 Euros, and when I thought I was about to get the money, the machine spit out my card without saying a word.  I thought "well, the money isn't there yet", found it a bit peculiar, and called my mom to ask if it could be that the money wasn't there yet. She called the bank in Iceland, then she called me back and told me that the 120 Euros had already been taken out of my account.  Nevertheless, I had no 120 Euros in my wallet, and seeing that this was a) not my money and b) the money I needed to get to Frankfurt, I felt... VERY BAD.  I went back to the bank, and to make a long story short, I finally found out today that I will get the money back. I hope I will never have that again and I promise you, I will never ever go to a  Sparkasse  again. I had to deal with some stupid blond my age,  that knew less about all of this than me, but pretended to know more, and what was worse - spoke very fast swäbisch (dialect for where I live in Germany). I felt like punching her. It was all just a little bit too much, especially 2 days before I go home.   Tomorrow Christmas comes to our house. Stefan and Stephanie are having a special Christmas dinner just for me :) I am really excited about it ... !  But, I think it is time to go to bed. I have to work in 6 hours...   ps. how does one say "especially" in German (please use the comment-system to tell me !) ??    urlLink  postCount('saka');   Especially what ?!

       You are reading the blog of a criminal   I got pulled over by the police today. No, I wasn't driving. No worries. I was on my bike and suddenly a policecar and two policemen were standing in my way, signing me to stop. I of course did, having no clue what I'd done wrong. Apparently they weren't too happy with the fact that I was biking on the pavement. I know it's against the law, but there's a lot of construction going on in this area and it's almost impossible to bike on the street so I usually make my life easier and just bike on the pavement, since that's what I'm used to from home.  I explained  excused myself, and then played the silly little foreigner who doesn't know the rules and regulations around here. They were real surprised when I told them I was a foreigner... which I must consider as a compliment for my accent, or?!  Anyhow, I asked them about the laws for people on bicycles, they told me, and then they told me they'd just keep stopping me and reminding me until I learned. With those words we wished each other a good weekend, I went back on my bike and my first encounter with the police had come and gone. I giggled my whole way back home. It was quite hilarious, but I also think it was a bit of a reminder for me because I tend to bike like a mad[wo]man and I can almost consider myself fortunate to have not had an accident yet.  But don't tell my mom that... she'll get worried.   So, my work for today is over, I've done a lot of work on my 'little surprise' tonight, and Stefan just brought me a plate filled with his Christmas cookies and I also have a fresh glass of milk, so I think I am going to enjoy the rest of this evening, relax and then go to bed early because I have to work at 7:30 again tomorrow morning. Plans changed so I am staying here tomorrow, not going to Würzburg. Saving 50  so ... that can't be considered as anything but good.  I hope you are having a good weekend.     urlLink  postCount('spil');   Say something !

      Just woke up after 2 hours of napping, and Dominik seems still to be enjoying his nap. I have been having serious troubles sleeping in the past few weeks, something that has never really happened to me before and I don't like it. Sure, sometimes I haven't been able to fall asleep when I'm too stressed, but these days I wake up all the time in the night, for no particular reason. So, I grab every possible chance to catch up on my sleep.   Otherwise things are fine. Working an awful lot these days, working today, tonight, tomorrow morning and then again Sunday evening. Nevertheless I am going to Würzburg for Sundaynight. Don't ask me why... First of all, I don't want to sit alone at home on a Saturday - and that benig my last Saturday before I go home for X-mas, and then, I just wanna go. As simple as that I guess.   The Christmas excitement is growing to great hights and  I can hardly stand it anymore that I have to wait until Thursday to go home, especially not knowing that Kristín (my sister) and Volker are on their way to Iceland at this very moment. Well, 6 days. I should survive that... and tonight I'm going to be very nice to myself, put on some Christmas music, light some candles and start packing and finish wrapping my Christmas presents.  Sounds pretty nice doesn't it?  I wanted to excuse the fact that you couldn't see my very 'Christmasy' picture or listen to the song I put in the other day. There's obviously still a bit of things I have yet to learn concerning these things.   I think I am going to changed and see if Dominik is really still sleeping.

       Íslendingaþáttur :)  Var að koma heim eftir enn eina kaffihúsaferðina með fransmanninum og er einhverra hluta vegna bara voða kát og glöð. Í fyrsta lagi af því að það er alltaf svo gaman hjá okkur, og í öðru lagi af því að ég hlakka svo ýkt og yfirdrifið til að fara heim.   Svo settist ég niður í kvöld á Melange (uppáhaldskaffihúsinu mínu) með dagbókina mína og ætlaði eiginlega að skrifa eitthvað af viti, en endaði á því að lesa það sem ég hef skrifað í þessa dagbók sem ég byrjaði á páskana 2000.  Það sem var einna gleðilegast að sjá var það hvað ég hef lært mikið og þroskast mikið (vona ég amk.) á þessum tæpu tveimur árum í mínu lífi. Nóg í rauninni að líta ár aftur í tímann til að sjá þennan mun,  en það er náttúrulega mikil breyting út af fyrir sig að klára menntó og reyna allt í einu einhvern veginn að verða fullorðin. Hefur kannski ekki alveg tekist ennþá, en ég er að læra og það er nú ekki eins og stundarglasið mitt sé að klárast, eða hvað ? =) Svo var líka voða gaman að sjá allt sem ég hef gert (og farið:) á þessum árum, og lesa um allt þetta skemmtilega fólk sem ég hef kynnst. Gerði mér þá líka grein fyrir að það er tilgangslaust að ætla að fara að sakna fólks hægri-vinstri, enda er sannur vinur einhver sem maður eignast og á. Ég vona að þið skiljið hvað ég er að fara.   Er búin að vera nokkuð hugsi síðastliðnar vikur, enda er gott (og nauðsynlegt) að spá og spekúlera svona ind i mellem og desember virðist venjulega vera minn mánuður til að gera það. Kannski ekki skrýtið þar sem desember er síðasti mánuður ársins og ég er alltaf í voðalegu 'nostralgíu' kasti á gamlárskvöld. Líklegast réttasti tíminn til að spá og spekúlera...   Annars, þarf ég að vakna eftir tæpa 6 tíma og ætti þessvegna að fara að kúra.  Ég þakka áheyrnina... og...   hlakka óendanlega til að sjá ykkur Frónbúana eftir 8 daga !!!!!      urlLink  postCount('bjor');  Vantar þig líka áheyrn?

      So... hey :) It's Monday again and I am sitting here, almost against my will writing this blogg. But, if I wouldn't be doing so, I would probably crawl into my bed and stay there, so I guess we can consider this as something useful, right?  It's freezing down here and it was freezing even more in Hamburg where I spent my weekend. Seriously, sometimes I think I was born in the wrong climate. I just can't take this cold - and now I have a cold ... which causing my feeling of extreme lazyness and just a general bad feeling within me. Plus, I slept really bad last night, woke up at 5:30, stressed out of my mind thinking that I had overslept and that I was too late for work. An hour and a half later I crawled out of bed, worked for 2 hours, and went directly back to bed when Dominik was gone. I slept until 2:30, had countless "night"mares and as I said before, I just generally feel pretty lousy. Which is... pretty lousy, but nothing I can do about it but try to get better and pray that this cold of mine won't evolve into a flue, because I really have no time to be sick right now.    The NaJuWo in Hamburg  .. was pretty good. Fridaymorning I woke up at 7 and didn't want anything but to keep on sleeping. Had a beer too many on Thursday night and went to bed too late, as you might have noticed.  I somehow got all my getting ready done in an hour, and left the house at 20 passed 8 because I had to bike into town and get my bike repaired over the weekend. My bike was really starting to threaten my safety. The stearing wheel was loose so I just had to trust in luck that I wouldn't hit a bumpt and loose control of it... I actually almost did on my way home on Thursday and almost had another accident ... but that's a different story.   I left Heidenheim at 9 and got to Hamburg Hauptbahnhof at half past 4. It's amazing how quickly one can travel through an entire country. An entire large country actually. I met 3 CISV'ers from Sweden at the trainstation and we went together to Poppenbüttel, where CISV Hamburg has a house of it's own.  A 100 CISV'ers were gathered there for this weekend, mostly all my age or younger. One third was foreigners, so we had ppl from Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Luxembourg and of course Iceland there ... ;) What did we do that weekend? We had some activities but mostly it was just about being social and having fun, meeting old friends and making new ones. Which is exactly what I did and I must say I had a lot of fun, even if a weekend like this leaves one completely drained and tired.   Saturdaynight was great, a band played for an hour and it was a pleasant surprise that they played real good music ! I sat for a while with friends and played a very crazy game called "I have never..." (I won't explain it at this point in time... and some of you probably know it) and then I danced so much that my muscles are killing me today. Well, we were listening to stuff like Nirvana and Guano Apes, so I probably did more of jumping than dancing, which probably explains why my calfs and my neck are killing me.   Sunday I woke up at 11, realising that I had to take my train in an hour and still having to take a shower, pack, say goodbye and find someone to drive me to the trainstation. I managed to do all that, but I only got to say goodbye to the ppl I bumped into on my way to the car. Unfortunatly, but then again, I've stopped being big on CISV goodbyes because I know I'll meet most of those people again.   I got to the trainstation in Hamburg and ran to the McDonalds for a very needed McNuggets Menü. When I got on my train, I got comfortable and slept until I got to Stuttgart 5 hours later. I got back to Heidenheim at 9, Etienne and Timo picked me up at the station and we went to the Irish pub for a beer.   It was a funny feeling coming back to Heidenheim and feeling happy to be 'home'. I was really happy to see my little town and just to be back home, even if I had a great weekend.   One the subject of going home... I CAN'T WAIT ! 10 days and I will be in our wonderful apartment in Garðabær with my mom, my sister and Volker.  Oh, what a nice, nice feeling... indescribable actually ! Christmas in Iceland again after 2 years away..   I still have 2 million and 5 things to do before I go, getting all the presents ready, packing, cleaning, getting my german course for next semester, work and try to find some time to spend with my friends, because unfortunatly Etienne is leaving on the 19th and he won't be returning to Germany.   And then - I'll be home and it will be Christmas =) How obvious is it that I'm extatic about the fact that I am going home for Christmas? Pretty obvious probably, but I am sure everyone can understand that.   But, I am going to leave you now and go unpack, clean my room or .. just ... watch TV and allow myself to feel a bit sick.

      Hey. I should be in bed a long time ago, seeing that I have to wake up in some 5 hours. BUT I just got home from having a couple of beers and a really interesting conversation and seeing that this song is playing repeat on my CD player at the moment, I would like to share it with you. Some of you might know this song and it's lyrics. I am not putting this here to say anything in particular, just to share that feeling I think all (of us girls out there) have once in a while. It describes the way society sometimes looks at women and the way they 'should' be. It's just nice to know that there is a song that says it all, and as for some of you, you know I carish good lyrics above anything in a good song.  So, this is yours to think about over the weekend. Please use the comments to comment - á íslensku or in English. Mir egal.  Until Monday =)  "Girls can wear jeans And cut their hair short Wear shirts and boots 'Cause it's OK to be a boy But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading 'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading But secretly you'd love to know what it's like Wouldn't you What it feels like for a girl  Silky smooth Lips as sweet as candy Tight blue jeans Skin that shows in patches  Strong inside but you don't know it Good little girls they never show it When you open up your mouth to speak Could you be a little weak  Do you know what it feels like for a girl Do you know what it feels like in this world For a girl  Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting  Hurt that's not supposed to show And tears that fall when no one knows When you're trying hard to be your best Could you be a little less  Strong inside but you don't know it Good little girls they never show it When you open up your mouth to speak Could you be a little weak"    urlLink  postCount('tuttuguogfimm');  What do you think????

      Written Thursday night at 1:30  So, I broke my promise about writing a decent blog yesterday. I've started that blog probably 3 times by now, but somehow I am not in the mood and always end up not continuing it.   16 days till I go home... I can't wait. I seriously can't wait. It's going to be so wonderful going home after the turbulance of the past few weeks in my life.    My weekend   As I said before, I was supposed to go away for the weekend with my family, but decided to stay here. I don't regret that choice because I had a really nice weekend here.   Fridayevening we went to Burger King...The Heidenheim Burger King was openened on the 29th and it was completely packed with ppl.The burger and fries tasted real good, but as usual one feels really bad after eating that stuff. I always feel a bit like I just ate poison or something.   Enough about that though, we went to Steinheim, hung out a bit, and went to Heidenheim for a beer or two. It was a really kosy evening, drinking beer, playing Yatzee and just relaxing.   Saturday we went to Steinheim and spent the day there doing mostly nothing. Had coffee and Stollen, watched some TV and just hung out there.  In the evening we went out, had a beer and then went to K2 where we danced, talked and drank some more beer.   On Sunday I didn't really do anything... I went to a café with Etienne... but that was it. I was feeling kind of finished.   Sunday afternoon I came home, feeling finished and weird, but a nice surprise awaited me. Stephi  Stefan had decorated the whole house for Christmas. Suddenly the Christmas spirit overtook me and I really, really looked forward to it. Most of all though, to be at home for Christmas again, celebrating it with the people I care the most about. At this moment, my homecoming for Christmas is the most important thing. I almost count the hours. Not that I am not enjoying my time here, it is just that it'll be a long awaited break, a chance to think and relax, reflect and go back with a clear mind. A time I could not think about being without now. These 3 weeks at home... (takk mamma fyrir póstinn. Ég get ekki sagt þér hvað það skipti mig miklu máli að fá þennan póst frá þér, og hvað það er mikilvægt að vita að þú skilur  styður mig !!!!)   Sunday night we ate a nice dinner together, and I had a relaxing night in my room, in my warm wool socks and my big wool sweater from the Fareo Islands. A night like that one should have more often ;)   Yesterday was nice. I babysitted for my usual 2 hours, and then I tried to blog, but I was too tired. I downloaded  listened to some Christmas songs and curled up in bed again. I fell asleep and slept for 2 hours, the most relaxing, calming sleep I have had for a long time.   That afternoon I of course went to my beloved café Melange and sat there reading Sjálfstætt fólk (Independant People by Halldór Laxness) for the second time. A good, and needed read, until Etienne called and said that he, Briget and Timo were going to Ulm for the Christmas Market.   I got myself on the next train to Ulm and met them there.   The Christmas Markets are almost a trademark on Germany this time of year, and something one has to experience. The one in Ulm was wonderful, even if I have to admit that it made me miss my family, with whom I have shared the Christmas Market in Lübeck the past 2 Christmas's.   We drank some glühwein (jólaglögg/warm redwine with spice), ate some waffles and I got a new friend, a lamb called Tinou. Tinou is a hand-puppet, but so cute and adorable... and my biggest smile and my biggest knús goes out to the one who brought him to me... =) He's now lying there on my pillow, waiting for me to go hug him and that I go to sleep.   I am 21, but when it comes to teddy bears and Christmas I am back to being 5 years old. It is something I hope I will have for as long as possible.   It is wonderful still to have this butterfly feeling about Christmas, still being excited about everything about it, still loving teddy bears and believing that they are alive and still being a child in some ways. It's something one should charish.   With those words, I wish you all a good night and hope that each and everyone of you can feel the true Christmas spirit of friendship and caring in their hearts, and not only the unfortunate stress that seems to follow it these days.     urlLink  postCount('tuttuguogþrír');  Tell me something sweet

       Today  I promised all of you a blog. Well, today was actually yesterday half an hour ago now... Somehow I had Monday, yesterday and today until evening off. Don't ask me why. Dominik is by his grandparents and here I am ... realising that being bored is a state of mind and the only thing one must do on a day off is try to wake up before noon and have a slight plan for the day. Otherwise, one will sink into lazyness and boredom and that's just a waste of precious time.  Yeah, I'm kindof telling myself off right now, because that's how I spent Monday and I almost fell into the same grave yesterday. But, I fought it and actually did something fun. After working myself through the Mont Blanc of clothes lying around my room, I put on my biking clothes, map and CD player in my pocket, backpack on my back and I biked to the swimming pool.  I haven't been there before - for the simple reason that it's far away, and in addition it is on top of the hill (Heidenheim is in a valley). I survived, even if my thighs were screaming loudly the last 5 minutes and with some intelligence I also figured out how the whole German system of going swimming works. The pool was really nice, clean and big, 50 m, and with a view overlooking the opposite hill. Seeing that it was afternoon, I watched the sunset as I swam a kilometer. It was quite nice =) I took a 2 hour break on my way home, had a glass of redwine, something to eat and read a lot of women magazines at a café. Again - quite nice !    My weekend  was wonderful. Just wonderful. Getting away from here was very needed, and meeting an Icelander (Svanur being such a nice exemplar) was even more needed. Fridaynight we had some beers at this great local brewery, overlooking a huge barrell where the beer is kept. We had an interesting conversation about movies, and I am already looking forward to coming back to Iceland so I can rent all those movies he got me interested in. Saturday, after waking up at 2 and having the best cup of coffee I have had since I moved to Germany, Svanur took my on a tour around Tübingen. It is a beautiful old city, with classical old German houses, narrow streets and a nice atmosphere. I hope I can return to Tübingen and explore more of it because I was really fascinated by it, and I'm almost jeulous of Svanur for being there.  Saturdaynight Svanur cooked an exellent dinner, and we shared a bottle of redwine, then some beers and ended up at a bar downtown with his good friend Amanda.  When we got out of there, having been thrown out because we were the last ones sitting, it had snowed. It was so pretty... and I was feeling all fluffy so I enjoyed the snow even more.   Sundaymorning unfortunatly came... and I didn't feel too good. And apperantly didn't look too good either Svanur told me. We watched almost all of the Iceland - Germany handball game on TV and then it was time for me to leave. Amanda had just backed a pizza that I got a piece of in a box with me and ate on the train. I was kind of sad to have to leave, and even sadder when I got home, but at least I have to return the box to Amanda, so I have to go back :)     urlLink  postCount('ll');   on this?

      Unbelievable but true. I went out jogging today ! I jogged for half an hour, came home and did sit ups and took a shower. I must say I feel pretty good afterwards. Only problem is is that Olga came over and brought me a box of chocolates. Very thoughtful, but not exactly what I'd been longing for after a good run.  Otherwise, not much news... Just finished watching ER and realised that I've missed out so many episodes now that I can't follow it. Don't know why, but I don't miss it. After it there was a Sex in the City episode I hadn't seen before (even if the Germans are probably 2 series behind us in Iceland), and I truly enjoyed that, seeing that I now have to wait 5 months to have my "Sex in the City Marathon" infront of the television. My mom tapes every episode for me and my sister. If you haven't noticed already, I'm quite a fan and am not all too happy about the fact that they have decided to stop producing the show.   On to other matters and as such, maybe matters also considered more intelligent. I do as well read a lot and I just read Angela's Ashes. I guess some of you have seen the film (I haven't) but the book is really,really good and keeps one captivated until it's over. I fully recommend it.  Last night I started reading The Picture of Dorian Grey, a book I have wanted to read for a few years now. Can't say much about it at the moment ,seeing that I'm only about 10 pages into it.  But, I've managed to read a bit since I got here and that makes me happy because I brought a lot of books and I have also been renting out a lot of books from the library. So far only one in German. Aha, that's another recommendation for anyone interested. The book is called "Herbstmilch". It's about the life of the farmer's wife in Bavaria. At least I found it interesting. Probably a lot of you won't agree with me..  Other than that, I finally decided what to study in university. And, I finally settled on taking [at least] my first year in Iceland. Actually, I'm looking forward to starting university next fall. I get episodes of being scared and thinking I won't make it, but as they say "don't knock it until you've tried it", so I am going to take it on and go !    urlLink  postCount('smll');  you have something to say?

      Lord of the Rings - the movie, has one thing over the book. It's filled with handsome heroes, that one can dream about for three hours ...  As if the Fellowship of the Ring didn't have enough handsomeness going around, they added one more in the Two Towers...

      Hello again. It's 4 minutes to midnight so this will probably be counted as Monday, even if as these letter are written, it's still Sunday.  Anyhow.  Just finished watching Titanic and having a few beers with Olga. It's amazing how much fun we can have, doing the simplest things. I'm happy I have her as a good friend, because she lives only 5 minutes away from me, and we can without any trouble meet each other.   My  weekend ... wasn't anything spectacular. Fridaynight I shortly met up with Olga at Melange and then I met up with Brigit and my German friends. It was really nice to see all of them again, and I found out that Brigit (who is moving to Italy tomorrow) will be living close to Florenze, where my beloved friend Brynhildur is also living.  So, seeing that they seem to me as two characters that might enjoy each others company, I decided give the two each other's numbers. If they do meet, the world REALLY is small.   Saturday I started working before 8, after sleeping only 4 hours. Stephi and Stefan went to the Stephi's practice around 9 to make everything ready, because the opening of her new practice was to begin at 11. Me and Dominik were to be there at 10:30. As I was,right on time, putting Dominik's shoes on and getting ready to leave the house, Stefan called and asked me where I was and sounded really stressed. I told him I was home and asked what was wrong. He said "Solla, it's 11:30", and was there in 30 seconds to pick us up.  Coming late to the practice, with around 40 people there, all waiting to see Dominik, was pretty much the most embarrasing moment I have had here in Heidenheim. I told them sorry about a hundred times, but I still feel really bad about ruining a piece of Stephi's big day.  What happened?... quite simple actually. I just looked at the clock wrong and kept thinking it was an hour earlier than it really was. Yeah... I'm not really clever. I can't even read a watch....! But, I know there's a few of you out there who have woken up, gotten dressed, had breakfast and ran out the door to school/work,then or later realising it's actually just 5 in the morning.   At least I hope my big mistake for my Au-Pair time has already been made.  I hope you all have a good week.     urlLink  postCount('sman');  ET phone home?

      Sunday afternoons.... there's something so kosy about them somehow and seeing that Sunday is the second last day of my weekend (because I have Monday's off as well) I don't really get the Sunday blues anymore. Plus, at the moment I don't have anything to get the blues about. I'm basically just doing fine. At the moment I am really relaxed, updating  urlLink Foto  once and again.  Sundays seem to be good days to spend infront of the computer, especially today because it is so cold and I am relaxed and quiet and most of all just want to relax by myself.  The past week as been good. A bit busy but good nevertheless.    Monday   was just wonderful. Probably the best day of this year =) but hopefully not the best one to come.  After Dominik was picked up I stuffed my CD player, the book I was reading and 50 euros in my bag and grabbed the next bus to the trainstation. At the trainstation I jumped on the train to  urlLink Ulm  and was there by noon. Ulm is the nearest 'city' to Heidenheim. It is on the borders to Bavaria and the Donau runs through it. It's also the birthplace of Albert Einstein and Ulm also has the highest church tower in the world. Just a little info for those of you who know nothing about Ulm =P  I started the day by having some Burger King and then I went window shopping. The weather was beautiful and made this day even more special. For the first time this winter it ws really snowing. It snowed thick snowflakes the whole day and even if I looked like the snowman, I loved it.  Well, I went to see the Ulmer Münster (the church with the big tower) but didn't go up the tower this time because it was so cloudy and I wouldn't have seen anything anyways.  From there I walked into the old part of the city, and took a lot of photos of those old slanting houses by the river, covered with fresh snow.  After all that walking it was time to sit down somewhere and I went to this lovely hidden little café and had a huge cup of hot chocolate and cream. Then I sat in there for almost 2 hours and read, while the snow kept on falling outside the window.  When my clothes had tried, I walked back to the trainstation, bought myself some candy and a girls magazine and went back to Heidenheim.  I felt so relaxed after that day.    Tuesdaynight   I went to see the Lord of the Rings. My friend Erika is American and she knew it is showed in English in Aalen on Tuesdays so we went. Wow... what a film. I got goosebumps every 5 minutes. I am still speechless. For those who haven't seen it... I recommend it.  Those who have a bit of humour, check this out  urlLink LOTR Slashart . Those who have homophobia or are absolutely fanatic about Lord of the Rings, should  NOT  check this site out.     urlLink  postCount('skimmer');  You want to say something ?

       Pínuponsulítið pirraður Íslendingaþáttur...   Ég ætla bara að gerast svo djörf og leyfa mér að kvarta ofurlítið í þetta skiptið. Þeir sem ekki nenna að hlusta á nöldur geta hætt að lesa  núna .  Tja, ekki að ég sé ekki alveg prýðilega hress og að flest gangi ekki bara nokkuð vel. Það er bara dálítið erfitt stundum að búa með fólki sem er allt öðruvísi en maður sjálfur og gerir oftast misheppnaðar tilraunir til að skilja mann.   Stefan og Stephanie eru ágæt. Ég er alls ekkert óánægð með þau sem fjölskyldu, enda hefur maður heyrt svo margar Au-Pair hryllingssögur, að ég þakka mínu sæla fyrir að þau eru nokkuð venjulegt fólk.  Stefan fer samt endalaust í taugarnar á mér, og ég er af öllum mætti að reyna að lifa með því og láta hann ekki pirra mig. Hann verður þrítugur á árinu, semsagt jafngamall Kristínu systur minni, og þykist hafa einhvern rétt á því að skipta sér af mér. Hann skiptir sér af því hvort ég er berfætt eða ekki, hvenær ég fer að sofa, hvert ég fer að djamma, hvenær ég kem heim, hvernig ég borða, hvernig ég klæði mig og svo mætti lengi telja.  Stephanie hinsvegar þarf endalaust að vera að segja mér hvað ég á að gera og hvernig, minna mig á að bursta tennurnar hans Dominiks, setja hann í snjóbuxur, gefa honum að borða o.s.frv. Það sem fer einna helst í taugarnar á mér er þó það að þau þurfa endalaust að vera að gera mér upp skoðanir og reyna að segja mér hvernig ég er. Ég held að þið séuð flest sammála mér að það er alveg gjörsamlega óþolandi þegar fólk gerir manni upp skoðanir, án þess að vita hvernig maður í raun og veru er. Ég fyrir lifandi löngu búin að gefast upp á því að reyna kommentera á þessa vitleysu í þeim enda hefur það ekki haft mikið upp á sig.   Stundum held ég að þau haldi að það vanti í mig nokkra kafla, en aðallega held ég að þau geri sér enga grein fyrir því að ég er næstum 22 ára en ekki 15. Ég lít að mestu leyti á þau sem jafnaldra mína og vildi óska að þau gætu gert slíkt hið sama.   Svo rífast þau meira en góðu hófi gegnir. Rífast, pirra sig, kíta og tuða bara almennt mikið í hvort öðru. Æsa sig upp yfir smámunum hjá hvort öðru sem ég myndi aldrei nenna að ergja mig yfir, og tekst oftast að eyðileggja indælustu stundir heimilislífsins hér með einskæru tuði. Yfir engu oft. Stærstu rifrildin snúast þó um uppeldið á Dominik og það finnst mér allra verst. Sérstaklega þar sem þau rífast beint fyrir framan hann. Hvaða mynd gefur það Dominik af sambandi foreldra sinna ef þau eru iðulega að rífast um uppeldisaðferðir? Ekki að ég sé hlynnt því að foreldrar "feli" það þegar þau eru að rífast, en ég held að stundum megi kyrrt liggja. Mér finnst það stundum betra að láta pirringinn í eigin hjarta líða hjá og sleppa því að segja eitthvað, og halda þar með heimilisfriðinn. Lífið utan heimils er oft nógu stressandi...  Talandi um uppeldisaðferðir, þá verð ég að játa að þrátt fyrir að vera algjör gullmoli, er Dominik ekki fullkomlega vel upp alinn. Tengist aldrinum auðvitað líka, en það að segja nei við hann hefur engin áhrif. Mamma hans fer nefnilega alltaf að flissa þegar hún segir nei og verður ALDREI reið við hann. Sama hvað á gengur. Þegar hún er heima er allt leyfilegt, þegar Stefan er heima er annað upp á teningnum og auðvitað er það ekkert sniðugt.  Hún er nefnilega með endalaust samviskubit yfir því að vera útivinnandi og vildi,held ég, helst bara sitja heima allan daginn, drekka te og leika við Dominik. Þar sem að það er ekki í boði fyrir hana, lætur hún þá allt eftir honum þegar hún  er  heima, brosir að öllu og dettur ekki í hug að skamma hann sama hvað á gengur.   Búin að tuða. Takk fyrir að hlusta !  Sá Hringadróttingssögu á þriðjudaginn - á ensku, sem betur fer. Ég er eiginlega orðlaus ... fékk gæsahúð á 5 mínútna fresti og tókst meira að segja að fá tár í augun í miðjum bardaganum, bara að því að þetta var allt svo ... ólýsanlegt.   Ég játa mig aftur sigraða og er með heimþrá. Er búin að dreyma mömmu, Kalla eða eitthvað að heiman sl.viku og vakna á hverjum morgni og þarf 5 mínútur til að jafna mig og fatta hvar ég er.  Veit annars að HÍ bíður mín næsta haust og að ég á vafalaust eftir að fá nóg af því að vera heima áður en ég veit af.  Komin tími til að klæða mig (skrifaði þetta blogg á handklæðinu, andinn kom yfir mig á meðan ég var í sturtu) og sjá hvort að Dominik fer ekki að vakna...    urlLink  postCount('immer');  you got something to add?

      I've started this blog about 5 times in the last 3 days but never gotten very far. It's not that I don't have enough to say - god knows I have enought to talk about, it's just that I haven't really wanted to blog lately. It's a weeks since I came back now and it stil feels a bit strange to be here. Dreamt about home all last night, and I do admit that I have a touch of homesickness. At home everything is so much easier, everything is so simple. But, because it isn't all easy here, I am learning something, right?! At least I think I am.    This first week back was pretty hard.  I worked 48 hours this week, and according to my contract I am only suppose to work 35 hours. I am hoping it will be a bit less next week and I am trying to be filled with understanding due to the fact that Stephi is opening her new dentist practice next week and there's a whole lot of work still to be done. Next week doesn't look as hectic, which is great.  Monday to Wednesday I mostly spent at home, apart from going to my lovely language course on Tuesday night and sitting at café Melange afterwards. Wednesday I went downtown and ran a lot of errands, and found out that I can actually buy some pretty cheap fast food downtown. That doesn't even taste so bad either :) !  Thursday I worked and then I went to Melange and did my homework until it was time to go to the last German course for the time being. This class is over now and the new one doesn't start until mid February and will then only be once a week. I am thinking about taking a Spanish course as well once a week, just to learn more, or at least to keep the knowledge of Spanish that I already have.  Anyhow, the whole course went to a café together and it was really nice. Me and Erika actually sat there until half past twelve, not realising it was so late because we just didn't have the time to stop talking and to look at the watch. It was really nice, and even nicer because Erika is American and I feel comfortable talking to her because I know I can proporly express myself and that we can have an intellectual discussion without me going mute. My German has gotten better, but I still can't say nearly all I want to say and it sometimes gets on my nerves.   Friday I worked 12 hours, but nevertheless succeeded also going out and getting a bit funny ;) Olga came over in the evening and when Stephi and Stefan got back we went to a bar and had lots of fun. It was sort of a "local bar" with those typical small town Germans, and music from the 80's. We got to know some people and had a pretty interesting time with them, but mostly we just laughed a lot and found the whole thing extremely funny. None of them had the slightest clue where Iceland was or that it even excisted at all, and some of them even found the death-penatly a good thing and thought that it should be used here in Germany. Well,  it's obvious that I didn't make any new best friends there, but we had a good time and sometimes that's all that matters.  I got home at 4, having had one Weissbier too many...   Yesterday I did my best to sleep in, but my host family doesn't really have the same sleeping habits as I do and in addition they don't really care weither I'm sleeping or not and tend to be a bit loud. Well, they left the house at 9, and I slumbered until 12. The telephone rang, the doorbell rang, the 3 churches in the neighbourhood all had a service that morning and I would have given a lot to be in my quiet bed in Iceland, being able to sleep as long as I want to with anything or anyone disturbing me.   I didn't do much yesterday, read a book, napped in the afternoon and babysit from 6 O'clock. After putting Dominik to bed I actually grabbed a pan and made me some dinner. Bread, ham, melted cheese and fried eggs. It tasted really good and I am real proud of myself for having had the courage to cook because on Thursday I almost burnt down the house.  How..? well, I was going to heat Dominiks lunch, but turn on the wrong part of the stove and burnt the dish-towel that lies there. Fortunatly I noticed before anything really caught fire, but I was in total shock for the rest of the day.   And today I plan to use my time off and walk downtown, have some cocoa and cake and walk home... The weather is really beautiful, sunshine and clear skies, but really cold. I think I'll survive ;)    urlLink  postCount('12.1');  Blah, blah??

      Hey everyone !  For those who don't understand Icelandic and don´t know already, I am back in Germany, safe and sound after an AWESOME vacation in Iceland. Wasn't that happy about leaving, and most certainly not leaving my mom, but now that I'm back and back into routine, it's all good.  Don't have too much time at the moment because I have my german course in an hour and I have to catch my bus... so ... I hope everyone has a good start of this new year !    urlLink  postCount('blub');  Blah, blah??

       Frosinn Íslendingaþáttur  Það eru alltaf allir að reyna að segja mér að það eigi að vera kalt á  ÍS landi. Ég er ekki alveg sammála, og get núna loksins sannað mál mitt með því að hér eru mínus 9 gráður og heima á Íslandi eru plús 5 gráður. Hef ég sannað mál mitt?  Annars þykist ég viss um að þið þekkið þetta öll, þessa dásamlegu spurningu frá öllum útlendingum eftir að þú hefur sagt þeim hvaðan þú sérst ..."Gvöð, er ekki kalt þar?!".  Nú eða blessaðir Ameríkanarnir sem vita eitt um Ísland "Ísland er grænt og Grænland er ís". Ég heyrði þessa miklu speki frá næstum hverjum einasta kana sem ég kynntist þegar ég var í Texas. Þeir læra þetta allir í 6.bekk, og svo virðist sem að þetta sé það eina sem þeir læra um Ísland. Fyrir utan kannski nokkra 'menningarvita' sem að vita líka um Björk, þrátt fyrir að nokkrir þeirra hafi verið sannfærðir um að hún væri bresk.  En ég ætla nú ekki að fara að bögga nokkurn mann fyrir að vera ekki sérfræðingur í þjóðháttum og menningu Íslands þar sem búa hvorki meira né minna en 268 þús. prýðileg prúðmenni. Ég skammast mín enn fyrir að hafa ekki vitað baun í bala um Kazakhstan (og kann enn ekki að stafsetja það), fyrr en ég eignaðist vinkonu þaðan, og þar búa þó 17 milljónir jarðarbúa. Ég fattaði fyrst í gær þegar ég var að skoða landakort hvar þetta ágæta land er.   Að öðrum málum. Flaug aftur til Þýskalands óbærilega snemma á sunnudagsmorguninn. Vansvefta, mygluð og sorgmædd... Vildi mér til happs að hinn góði maður  Herr Pétursson flaug út með mér og bjargaði mér frá sorg og almennum leiðindum. Við hrutum að vísu mest alla leiðina í flugvélinni (amk. ég, Svanur virtist of upptekinn af því að læra að elda af Jamie Oliver) og svo tókum við lestina til Stuttgart saman. Í lestinni hittum við tvo Íslendinga sem búa í Stuttgart og ég komst að því að það er nokkuð væn Íslendinganýlenda í og um Stuttgart. Fyrir þá sem ekki vita er ég svona 1 og hálfan tíma frá Stuttgart, en hef svo aftur á móti engan rosalegan áhuga að fara að hanga utan í Íslendingunum. Það var ekki alveg tilgangur ferðarinnar hingað.   Ég var svolítið stúrin á sunnudagskvöldið og langaði mest að fara heim aftur, en er alveg komin í gírinn aftur, sérstaklega eftir að hafa byrjað að vinna aftur í dag og er svo að fara í minn margrómaða þýskutíma núna eftir 10 mínútur. Svo ætla ég auðvitað á Melange eftir tímann minn og njóta þess að drekka einn Kristall Königsbräu (Weissbier framleiddur hér á svæðinu), og vonandi tekst mér að draga eitthvað af vinkonunum með.   Og bara takk til ykkar allra heima á Fróni. Rosalega stórt takk. Ég átti FRÁBÆRT jólafrí, frábær áramót, ég hefði bara ekki óskað mér neins betra...  Kannski að ég hefði verið aðeins lengur, en tja, ég hefði þá bara ekkert farið aftur út á endanum, því það er svo rosalega voða gott að vera heima =)

      It's a brand new year !!! I kind of very much like that idea =) I wasn't so fond of it when I was saying goodbye to 2002, which was an awesome year in my life, but now that 2003 is here I embraze it and am preparing to make the best of it.  Just before midnight, as I was starting my crying session (a yearly even in my life at New Years Eve), a good friend pointed out to me that I should be happy about the new year. It was like a book with nothing written in it, just waiting to be filled. Filled with possibilities.  And I can say that I cried less this year than I have the years before. But I also think that a great year deserves a few tears when one departs from it. I don't know why - it's just something I have to do at midnight on New Years Eve... cry !   Away from philosophical thoughts about the New Year and to all the fun we had !!! TAKK GUJA og BRYNDÍS fyrir partýið !  I had dinner at  urlLink Guja's  place, celebrated with my family, her family and our good friend Hjorvar, watched the New Year firework itself into Iceland... from the most awesome place in the world to watch the fireworks ! The view over Reykjavik from Guja's house is just more magical than one can imagine. It's a must see... really !  Around 1 we went downtown and were the first ppl to get there to the bar where Guja was going to have her New Years party this time. Things were a bit slow at first, but it gave Hjorvar and me the chance to try out a few glasses of the free beer and philosophies about life, love and silly stuff in general.  I met up with a lot of people I haven't seen in a long time, talked a lot, laughed a lot, drank a lot and generally had a very good time.  I am hoping I will be here in a year to celebrate again ! It was seriously worth coming home to =)  I was pretty dead yesterday and slept most of the day, except for a TV session and a long reading session between 9 in the evening and 4 in the morning.   Today I was a bit more productive and tomorrow I will hopefully get the things I need done before I leave.   Hope you all had fun as well !   urlLink  postCount('blubb');  You wanna say hi?

       Hair  is something I suddenly have a bit of and makes my image in the mirror look very unfamiliar to the girl I always expect to see. My hair gets on my nerves these days, but I am putting myself and my endurance to the test, and I am going to stick this "hair-growing" out as long as it takes for my hair to look pretty. If it ever will. Sometimes I just don't think my head or my hair was made to have long hair. And I think I am fundamentally missing the element needed to grow hair to any lenghts. I just do not understand the point of having long hair. It's completely beyond me.  Sure, all this redness growing out of my head is pretty nice but having hair is actually kind of like having a pet! You have to give it water and nourishment, brush it and pet it for it to be nice. It also gets in your way and leaves hairs everywhere around the house.  It needs constant love and care. One cannot "forget" about it for a weekend and then come back to it. Oh no, disaster will have struck by then.  But, I am going to be strong. I am going to grow my hair at least until this Au-Pair time is over. I will !!!

      This article was on  urlLink Mogginn  and it make me so angry that I decided to find the original one in English. Click on the link to read the whole thing. It infuriates me to think that there is one country that thinks it can oppress the the whole world to obidience. To be honest, the whole current situation infuriates me.   Yesterday I participated in the world wide demostration against the war and was moved by seeing all those people who shared my oppinion and took the time to come and express their views. I went with my friends Camilla (Denmark) and Erika (USA) to Stuttgart and we marched with 50.000 others in the second largest demonstration in Germany. I hope you took the time as well yesterday and participated in the demonstration.

       urlLink Peter Beaumont, David Roseand Paul Beaver Sunday February 16, 2003 The Observer   America is to punish Germany for leading international opposition to a war against Iraq. The US will withdraw all its troops and bases from there and end military and industrial co-operation between the two countries - moves that could cost the Germans billions of euros  The plan - discussed by Pentagon officials and military chiefs last week on the orders of Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld - is designed 'to harm' the German economy to make an example of the country for what US hawks see as Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's 'treachery'.   The hawks believe that making an example of Germany will force other countries heavily dependent on US trade to think twice about standing up to America in future.

Eg skammast min fra toppi ofan i taer og for meira ad segja adeins ad skaela i ollu sjokkinu. Eg held i alvoru ad eg hafi aldrei a aevinni kludrad svona morgu og eg er farin ad hafa ahyggjur af thvi ad thau haldi ad eg se algjor auli og hafi ekkert milli eyrnanna. Er buin ad segja Stefan thetta, hann sagdi bara "ad thad vaeru til verri hlutir" en for svo ad skamma mig fyrir eitthvad annad i stadinn.   Er ad reyna ad harka af mer thessa dagana og muna ad "what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger". Get samt gladst yfir komandi dogum. Camilla, engillinn minn fra Danaveldi er ad koma i heimsokn a morgun og aetlar ad vera Valentinan min. Eg hlakka osegjanlega mikid til. Thad verdur svo gott ad hafa hana her, thratt fyrir ad hun verdi adeins eina nott. Hlakka bara svo til ad spjalla vid hana um allt sem ad hefur gerst sidan vid hittumst sidast, og ad hafa einhvern hja mer sem thekkir mig svona vel. A laugardagsmorguninn erum vid svo ad fara med Eriku og hennar fjolskyldu til Stuttgart ad motmaela stridinu i Irak.   A laugardaginn eru nefnilega sameiginleg motmaeli ut um allan heim. Lika i Reykjavik. Eg maeli eindregid med thvi ad allir sem vettlingi geta valdi taki thatt.   Fyrir ahugasama maeli eg med  urlLink 15.febrúar  Er i kvold ad fara til Eriku ad bua til spjold og vera listraen vid undirbuning motmaelanna. Er endalaust glod ad eg kynntist Eriku, jafnvel thott ad vid hittumst ekki oft. Hun er dasamlega kaldhaedin, hefur svipadar skodanir og eg og thad er fatt skemmtilegra en ad spjalla vid hana um menn og malefni.   Ad odrum malum. Eg var ad lesa  urlLink Moggann  i gaer og thar var frett sem ad eg get ekki truad.  "...Í ritinu, sem fjallar um aðildarlönd ESB og EFTA/EES-landa, kemur fram að 15% landsmanna eru í námi ofar skyldustigi, en til samanburðar er hlutfallið 10% í löndum ESB. " Er thetta bara eg, eda eru thetta faranlegar, og beinlinis rangar tolur? Frettin i fullri lengd er i Innlent, og var birt i gaer, 11.2.

       Islendingathattur  Var ad skruddast heim eftir eitt raudvinsglas og kosyheit med Olgu a "barnum okkar". Eins og sumir muna kannski eftir uppgotvadi eg hverfisbarinn herna um daginn og sidan tha er thetta ordid okkar stadur.

Og opid thangad til ad sidasti madur fer ut, sem er alltaf kostur, thvi mer finnst ekkert leidinlegra en ad thurfa ad fara heim a midnaetti, rett thegar madur er komin i spjallgirinn.

Eg er buin ad vera ad velta mer upp ur thessu kvefi minu upp a sidkastid og hef ekki verid serlega felagslynd. Hef thar ad auki haft Paul Auster mer vid hlid, sem er felagsskapur ut af fyrir sig.

Thvi midur eiginlega, en eg er nu i seinni tid buin ad laera thad ad manni getur ekki komid vel saman vid alla. Eg lenti i langri umraedu vid modurina a heimilinu (eg hef thau grunud fyrir ad lesa bloggid mitt thannig ad eg sleppi nofnunum i thetta skiptid) a sunnudaginn. I rauninni mjog athyglisverdri umraedu sem for um vidan voll, og thar sem hun helt fram ymsu sem eg var ekki sammala - og eg vafalaust odru sem hun ekki var sammala. Henni finnst t.d. voda leidinlegt ad eg er ekki "hluti af fjolskyldunni" og ad vid gerum aldrei neitt saman. Kannski er eg bara kold og tilfinningalaus, en mer finnst eg ekki getad ordid hluti af thessari fjolskyldu. Finnst raunar faranlegt ad fara fram a thad thvi eg er annad Au-Pairid theirra, og eftir thvi sem thau segja, annad af mjog morgum sem thau eiga eftir ad hafa.

Hun lagdi til ad vid gerdum eitthvad saman, spiludum eda eitthvad, en sannleikur malsins er sa ad a kvoldin situr hun uppi og horfir a sjonvarpid eda vinnur i tolvunni, og hann situr inn a skrifstofunni sinni i tolvunni. Eg se ekki ad thad se mikil fjolskylduskemmtun her i gangi a kvoldin, og eg veit ekki alveg hvort hun byst vid ad eg taki frumkvaedi i thessu mali, eda hvernig hun ser thetta fyrir ser yfir hofud. Thar ad auki a eg alveg prydilega fjolskyldu fyrir.   Eg geri mer fulla grein fyrir ad thad eru tvaer hlidar a thessu mali (jafnvel thrjar thar sem vid erum thrju), en eg er buin ad komast ad einu um thau. I hvers kyns umraedum  hefur hann alltaf rett fyrir ser, og hun leikur alltaf pislarvottinn. Sama hvort ad su umraeda hefur eitthvad med mig ad gera eda ekki. Eg veit ekki alveg hvada hlutverki eg er i, vona hinsvegar ad eg se ad hondla thetta mal a rettan hatt og veit amk. eitt fyrir vist - mer tekst yfirleitt ad vera malaefnalegri en thau. Tja, ju, eg er orugglega kold og tilfinningalaus, en eg lit a thetta meira sem vinnu en nokkud annad.

      For some reason I decided to change the layout and some other stuff on  urlLink Foto . I don't know why I got myself into something so tedious and irritating when it's almost midnight... even if I have a really good internet connection, just putting one picture on there takes about 7 minutes and it's just... pretty annoying in the long run. It's far away from being ready, so I don't really recommend checking it out right now.  Let's just say it's down for maintenance :) I have some new pictures ready to put on there as soon as my "face-lift" of that site is done. As for other internet news - I have a more simple URL to remember now. It gets you exactly where you are now, and it's www.solla.tk. Pretty neat, isn't it?  Mondays are generally nice days. Unbelievable but true, I did not crawl back into bed and snore until noon after Dominik left this morning. I actually took the next bus downtown and met Erika and her daughter Tera at Café Melange. We had some nice cappucino, and as usually, a really nice talk. Then we went to a bookstore and I found a book that made my day. Well, probably made my week because I am "saving" it, i.e. reading it little by little. It is called Moon Palace and is by one of my favorite authors, Paul Auster. The man is a genious and this book got me so captivated that I've been in a different world all day. There's something indescribable about his books. Something that grabs you, makes ones imagination run wild and makes one look at the world differently for a while.   I ran around town a bit after I said ciao to Erika, made a bargain on a real nice wool sweater at Benetton,signed up for my upcoming german class, and a spanish class as well.  I came home in the afternoon. Had planned to be productive, but got stuck infront of the computer playing Kings Quest. Those who know it will think I just turned insane, but somehow these golden oldies of computer games fascinate me. And now that I can download computer games through my  magnificent  KaZaA, I have allowed myself to do so and to play a bit. In the hope I won't get hooked... ;)  I guess I will go to bed with Paul Auster now though =) It sounds like a good idea !    urlLink  postCount('virun');   on this?

      Written before midnight, before February ... while it was still Friday the 31st of January  I'm alive and well. The same cannot be said for the language settings of my Internet Explorer. For that reason I have been very pissed off at my Internet lately, and I am going to ask Stefan to fix it tomorrow. See, Olga came over the other day and checked her E-mail. As some of you clever people might figure, all the sites she checked were in russian, so now my Explorer reads every single strange letter (being Icelandic, German or anything else) as russian.   And 5 minutes ago I finally figured out what's wrong with my eyes. For the past 3 days I've made an attempt to wear mascara (something I never really do) and my eyes have been all weird. I've been thinking that it was because of the chlor in the swimming pool, but now I've realised that I'm just allergic to my mascara. I know. You are all wondering why I was telling you this. Such a vital piece of information, isn't it ? :)  Wednesday was quite productive. I cleaned my room and moved out a lot of stuff from the room that has been getting on my nerves. The room is big and bright and I didn't really think it was being flattered as it should have been. I must say - it looks great now. And as funny as it seems, it is so much MY room that it's almost scary, and I've only lived here for 4 months now. Probably mostly for the reason that I have succeeded to fill it with my stuff. And mind you, it's more then 2 times bigger than my room in Iceland and I moved here with 2 suitcases. I'll probably have to donate most of my stuff before I go home.   It snowed on Wednesday and I am truly living in a "winter wonderland". Fluffy white snow, snowing more and more every day. It's so beautiful and I have been having so much fun playing in the snow with Dominik lately. Who is, by the way, becoming quite the English genius. To refresh some of your memories, he's 19 months old now and I am supposed to teach him English. He adds to his vocabulary every day, but his favorite word by far is "belly". Not surprising, seeing that he has a belly in the size and shape of a watermelon ;) Eat, open, downstairs, dog, bunny and spoon are for example a part of his daily vocabulary, and the greatest thing is how well he understands me. He might reply in German, but at least he understands what I said and I really find that amazing, because I myself wasn't so sure how much of a second language a 15 month old (as he was when I came) was able to learn. And... I can't say I mind being able to speak English with him all day, even if I'm not sure how good it is for my German.   Tomorrow I finally have an appointment with a hairdresser. For real ! It's been over 4 months since I last had my hair cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if people had started mixing me up with the average broom when they see me. Not that people ever see a broom walking down the street wearing a jacket and shoes but nevermind.   I think the last sentance prooves the fact that I am exhausted. Woke up at a quarter to 7 this morning, after having yet another bad night. Why I cannot sleep through a whole night here like I normally do remains a mystery to me. I am hoping it will get better though because I am no good after a bad nights sleep. Then again - who is?     urlLink  postCount('virkun');   on this?

      I did a spring clean on this page and completely changed the look of it. I haven't figured everything out yet, but I'm pretty close to being done.  I hope you like the new look as well. All comments are welcomed =) Have a great weekend !!!

       Spring   It's here. Yesterday it was 15°C and sunshine the whole day through. Even so good that I wore a skirt and practiced biking with a skirt on. Cannot say I was extremly successful, but then again, I think I'll have enough time to practice in the coming months. It's incredible for me to experience spring so early, seeing that the weather here right now would be considered a  very nice summer day   in Iceland. The air has even started to smell of "summer abroad". I am sure there are a few people out there who know what I mean.   Everything is good these days. Absolutely everything. Yesterday I biked 'home' from having a beer with my spanish class and was filled with this really satisfied feeling.  Everything is in place and it is so wonderful to feel happy and positive again - after not being all so happy in the past 2 months.  It without a doubt has a lot to do with the company I've been in lately. I have finally found someone here that completely, utterly understands me, who has the same interests as me, who listens to my blabber and most importantly, loves chocolate as much as I do =) Those who read my last entry in Icelandic, already know what's going on.  His name is Justin and he's amazing. Just thinking about him makes me smile, and I'm already looking forward to seeing him again - even if I just left him 2 hours ago.    What have I been doing lately, apart from having butterflies in my stoumache?   Of course I managed to get sick last week. Didn't get a fever, but I had a really bad throatache and everything was swollen and weird in my throat.  So, I went to the doctor on Friday and he gave me some penicillin. Somehow I am not so sure it has worked wonders yet, because last night my throat started aching again and my left gland is back to being swollen. Don't really know what to think, but I'm going to give it a day and see what happens.   The weekends was nice and kosy. Fridaynight I was 'home alone' at Justin's place and decided to pamper myself and took a bath. I haven't taken a bath more than 6 months and I'd completely forgotten how wonderful it is. It's just so relaxing.  Saturday I went to town in the sunshine, visited Justin at work  met up with my friends at a café. In the evening I had to work, which wasn't too bad, because I had to work on Sundaymorning, and my energy level has been really low lately so it was really pleasant to go to bed early.   Sunday was beautiful. Justin and I went out for icecream in the afternoon, walked up to the castle to enjoy the sunshine and then caught the sunset as well. I think Heidenheim wouldn't be much without the castle. It's so pretty, even more so when you are standing up there.     Otherwise the days just pass in happiness. The sunshine has good affect on all of us. Dominik (or Omininik like he says) melts me more and more each day, being sweet  wonderful beyond belief. On Monday he said his first 'sentance' in English. We were reading a book, he pointed at one of the pictures and said "Pig eating".  It's the first time he connects words in English and it made me so proud. He's such a fast learner, and in general just an amazing little man. I've already started to dread the day when I will have to depart from him.  My freetime these days I spend almost entirely with Justin, and of course I've had my German and my Spanish course as well this week. The Spanish course was last night and it was SO much fun. The class is really great. They've been studying together for the last 5 years, with the same teacher and they are really close, but also very welcoming. It's one of the few times since I've been here that people don't look at me as   the Au-Pair . It's nice to get a bit more respect than I usually get.   Tonight I have to work at eight, but I am nevertheless planning to try to catch a bit of an Against War demonstration downtown before that. The band Justin's in is also playing and I'd really like to see them play.  I suppose this will be it for now. I promise  to try  to write more frequently.

       Sorry   It's been forever and a half since I've written anything in English. I've just been having a lot of strange thoughts lately that I can only express in Icelandic.  But it's all good. Today all is good in my world and it's a really comfortable feeling.  I had a great weekend, went to a play at the Waldorf school here on Fridaynight, lazy-assed around my room on Saturday and then in the evening I went to K2 and had an awesome time. Sunday I went to a pretty interesting art exihibition, and listened to didgeridoo played live for the first time. What a cool instrument. I cannot understand how all those sounds are made, it sounds like something from another dimention...   I unfortunatly have to go, but I promise to continue this later...

      I spent the   weekend   in Tubingen visiting Svanur again. It was a nice long weekend, actually more like a vacation. We didn't do much of concequence, except for drinking 'a few' beers, watch TV and of course have a movie marathon on Sunday. We took the train to Stuttgart on Sunday afternoon and watched Gans of New York and Chicago. If you're wondering why we saw both at the same time, it was because we were at a movie theater where they show the movies in English, and that is something you don't find everywhere in Germany.  I don't understand why both movies have a Oscar nomination though. Gangs of New York was better than Chicage but both movies were typical Hollywood movies, which is something I don't really appriciate. Nevertheless I did enjoy watching two decent movies in English.   I came home Tuesday morning and I must say that I was real happy to come home. I think that shows that I had a good vacation.

      I should be... doing something else than sitting here... I should probably be running around cleaning my room, unpacking and doing laundry after the weekend. But I am sitting here. What a surprise ! =) First of all - a great big TAKK to everyone who made me smile on   Thursday  . I had a really nice day, woke up at 7:30 with my mom calling and tried to fall asleep again after that but without any luck. So, I sat up in my bed with the packages and letters that I'd recieved and opened them. It was a wonderful way to start the day. When I had take a long shower and gotten dressed, I went upstairs where Stephi and Dominik waited for me. They sung to me and then we had cake for breakfast ! I also got 2 more presents, the one from my host family and the present from my dad that Stephi had managed hiding for a week. That present from my dad was actually the only one I knew for sure that I was getting 'cause he'd told me about it, so I'd been quite disappointed that it hadn't arrived before my birthday. Stephi actually wanted to hide all of my presents, but since I am usually the one that's home at lunchtime when the mail comes, she didn't succeed. It was a nice thought though.   The day was pretty ordinary, except for the fact that I got a lot of phonecalls and was jumping around with joy.  In the evening I put on a tie, hat and a beard. Olga came over all dressed up like a lady (my lady:) and we went with Stephi to Ulm to celebrate what could be translated as Women's Carnival Night. It was fun to see so many people in costumes having fun, and seeing the normal Germans be so "wild". We left Ulm at midnight because we all had to work early the next morning, which was good because I had had a long day and had a long weekend ahead of me.

       The Easter Bunny was nice to me this year     She  gave me a lot of chocolate, great weather, good mood and someone to share it all with. I haven't had so much fun over Easter for a long time. Well, being at european CISV meetings twice over Easter was really cool, but having such a cosy, quiet Easter again was really pleasant.   On Good Friday we went to church. Yeap, I freewillingly went to mass, just because I felt like it. And I felt really peaceful and harmonious afterwards. In the evening the unthinkable happened. I cooked dinner. And it actually tasted good. At least Justin and I are still alive and don't have any symptoms of food poisoning  yet .  After my wonderful dinner we were quite up and going so we went to K2 and then to this funny disco called Moms where we ended up dancing pretty much until we dropped and went home.   Saturday therefore is blurry. Hungover and sleepy. I was very unactive to say the least.   Sunday was just glorious. We searched for the Easter eggs that the Easter bunny had left for us, ate a wonderful breakfast and then went back to bed to digest and then ate more chocolate. In the evening I finally got to see Justin and his band in concert and had a lot of fun watching them. I've watched them at practice at least 3 times now, so it was great to finally see them live on stage infront of an audience. They are pretty cool. If you look hard enough, you'll find a link to their website somewhere around ;)  I actually feel like I'm made out of chocolate at the moment. Justin's place and this house are just filled with chocolate in different shapes and tastes. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm afraid I might be getting sick of chocolate. Which isn't at all good because who's going to eat up the supplies then?! Knowing me, I'll probably be crawing for chocolate as soon as I wake up tomorrow morning. Nah, maybe not at 7 when I get up, but eventually. The muesli  my cup of coffee always come first.

       What a wonderful easter it was.    It was absolutely glorious... and ... I need a cup of coffee. It's almost 3 and I haven't had one yet. It's unbelievable, but I was too tired to raise my head when Justin offered me one this morning, and until now I just haven't gotten myself around to it. Which might be why I feel a bit off a the moment. I wouldn't ever deny my addiction to caffein. All one has to do is to watch me go through a day without some, and I'll be busted. And, I actually don't mind. It's one addiction I actually like =)    And that's what I'm going to do now. Make myself a nice cup of coffee and have a slice of bread. The rain is pooring down outside and it's a perfect moment to read a bit and drink some coffee.

      And if you survived through the last entry you are a hero. I just read it over and realised that it's a bunch of dry facts of what's been going on in my life.  As for what is going on in my head - things are looking fairly positive as well. My life has taken a very positive turn in the past month. I did not expect to fall in love, and was actually certain that there wasn't anyone anywhere I could fall in love with. I suppose it happens when you least expect it  :)  It is strange how one person can have such a positive affect. Sure, I am looking at the world through pink glasses at the moment, but I really needed it. I was really pessimistic and unhappy about a lot of things in the beginning of this year, and I was feeling really sorry for myself somehow.  After my birthday things looked more positive, but moving on to my pink cloud made me realise that it really isn't all bad. Not at all actually.   I am on the verge of applying for university, just got a booklet from LIN (Icelandic Student Loans) today from my mom and have been trying to figure out all this stuff. Still not all together certain what I will end up studying, but I am getting there. Won't tell anyone anything yet, but I promise you'll be the first to know what I write on that application when it's been sent away.   And I am really proud of myself. I stayed all alone in Justin's apartment last night and I was fine. I wasn't scared at all. It crossed my mind that afternoon, if I'd be scared staying there all by myself, but I realised that I can't be scared of sleeping alone for the rest of my life. Hopefully soon I will grow up and get my own place and by that time I will have to learn not to be afraid of being alone in the dark. I think I am getting somewhere already !  Anyhow. It's very late. Very very late and I have to wake up in 5 hours. I should be ashamed of myself, but I am not. I love staying up late.

       I am truly ashamed of myself  and I should be. Never has so much time passed between my entries, and I truly apologize to those few who still bother to look. I know I've been promising a lot lately but haven't really been keeping my promises at all.  Could try to excuse myself by saying I was busy and that I haven't had internet access - but those who know a little about my life, also know that I work Monday to Friday and have a long lunch break every day while Dominik sleeps, so actually - I have no valid excuse.   But I am feeling brilliant. Just talked to my mom on the phone for an hour and soon I will be heading off to bed. Tomorrow I have a lot of stuff to do, errands to run and money to spend. But the only really important thing I have to do is to go to the trainstation tomorrow afternoon. Justin went to west Germany yesterday to see his grandparents and he'll be back tomorrow. It's been a bit strange being without him, especially because I stayed at his place over the weekend, but nice at the same time. Not nice to be without him, but I did have a very quiet, relaxing weekend, which was something I think I needed.   Last week was somehow filled with stuff to do, and me pushing the things I really had to do ahead of me.   Last Monday  I went to the doctor again (this time a brilliant one !), got taken real good care of and according to her I'm going to be fit as a fiddle soon. Good to know.  I worked in the evening and managed to talk on the phone for many, many minutes. When Stephi came back at 11, Justin and I biked off to K2 where one of Justin's friends was celebrating his birthday, had a couple of beers and then we went home where Justin had a  lovely  surprise waiting for me.   Tuesday  came and went in being very tired, taking a nap, going to German class and somehow biking home at midnight, crashing into bed and feeling a bit better on  Wednesday . Which was a cool day actually. After work, Justin and I biked to the next town, and then up a hill where Justin went rock climbing with his friends. I on the other hand grabbed my book and walked out into the woods, sat down in the sun and read. It was glorious and I'm sure I caught a few freckles that day.  In the evening I took Justin to the movies to see  urlLink  Bowling for Columbine  . If you haven't seen it, please do. I lack words to describe how amazing this documentary is. All I can say is that I cried half through it and was still crying when we came out. The evil in the world just made me so sad and somehow so hopeless.   Thursday   I again went to the doctor to get results from a bloodtest she had made on Monday. She again convinced me that I was going to be fine. That day I worked from 11 to midnight. Having Dominik for so long was hard, but extremely enjoyable. He is such a little marshmellow and I loved having so much time with him.  I especially love putting him to bed, and he was especially adorable that evening.    My weekend  started early. I only had to work an hour and a half on Friday because Stefan had taken the day off from work. I ate well that day... =) Brought brunch to Justin , had lunch at the bistro where he works and then we had redwine and chocolate in the evening.  On Saturday I met up with a friend in town in the afternoon, and then spent the evening by myself with Justin's DVD's and the redwine bottle. Had a perfect evening in solitude, and slept soundly until noon today. Had breakfast in bed and didn't get up until 2, when I got myself together and enthusiastically cleaned up around me. Came back here in the afternoon, and since I was in the "spring-clean" mood I also cleaned every inch of my room today.   And here I am. Having only 3 days of work ahead of me and then a 4 day Easter vacation I am greatly looking forward to.

       I should ...  be doing something else. But here, infront of the computer it is nice and friendly at the moment. And somehow unfamiliar because I am learning to survive a whole day without it. Nevertheless I must admit that I feel a bit handicapped sometimes not to have my computer next to me 24/7 but the comfort that the computer has given me so far has been replaced :) Working tonight and it's odd. I don't really know what to do with myself. Ok, I've managed to talk to Brynhildur for 100 minutes on the phone, tried calling my mom and my sister but both told me that they didn't have any time to talk to me. Obviously they don't need me as much as I thought they did ;) You see, before Justin started occupying my freetime, I used to call both of them every day. And now, that I am at home at a decent hour one evening and decide to be nice and call them - they just don't want to talk to me. Nah, I'm not insulted though. I am fully aware of the fact that I called them every day because I needed them a lot more than they needed me.   I've been trying to be productive, I've managed to clean my bathroom, wrap a birthday present and I even got artistic and painted a bit, which is something I haven't done in a long time. But, I nevertheless feel pretty restless and can't wait to bike my way back to Justin's place.  Yesterday I went to band practice with him. They've had two gigs since we started being together, but I've been working on those evenings, and it was really cool to see them play their music live. They are a bit weird and funny - but I'd be the last person to say that there's something wrong with that.   Tomorrow is packed. Tera, Erika's daughter is celebrating her birthday tomorrow and then after the children leave, they've invited me for dinner. Later tomorrow night me and Justin are planning to go to K2. I hope we will because I am somehow really in the mood to go dance and have fun. Sunday will hopefully be quiet and cosy, because next week I really have to boot my own behind and get a lot of things done.    One should be doing a lot of things...

       Second try  I have already written an entry, but as I tried to post it, the internet decided to fail me and deleted my entry. Some swearing in Icelandic was involved, but I did some yoga breathing and I am a little better now. Patience with the computer really isn´t my strong point.  People have been complaining that I´ve not been paying too much attention to my blog lately. Thing is that I´m almost never at home anymore, and when I´m at home I´m either working, sleeping or getting ready to leave again. And at Justin´s place, where I am most of the time, there is no internet, no telephone and no television. It´s very nice actually. It was kind of like taking a vacation to a farm first time I was there by myself. But it´s very healthy when one is as addicted to technology (mostly the internet...) to get some away time and realise that there is life without all that. Actually quite a nice life.   As for spring, it took a vacation today and we even got to seem a bit of snow falling down. Being Icelandic I nevertheless bought myself a very nice pair of sandals today. For the bargain price of 15 Euros. I have been searching for sandals for a while, but Germany is the worst place to buy shoes for sure. An absolute horror, but I suppose it´s good for me at the moment because my budget wouldn´t survive me falling for a great pair of 38 threp or Kenneth Cole shoes. And as most women know... once you fall for a pair, you will almost sell your soul to get them. And seeing that I don´t have a credit card anymore (and what a sweet, free life it is indeed!), there is no way I can allow myself stuff like that.   It´s been hard, but now I´ve learned to live with my 250 Euros a month. I end the month with 5 cents every time, but I never get cold or hungry so I can´t complain. Actually I go to cafès a lot, eat more chocolate than I´d like to admit and basically live a pretty pleasant life even if I´m broke.  But as my life is right now, it can´t be considered anything but nice. Nice might even be an understatement. My pink cloud is at least very warm and fuzzy and I´m planning on staying there.   Seeing that I´m never home anymore, I´ve been awful at writing E-mails, keeping in touch and basically doing anything of concequence. But then again, life isn´t this lovely all the time, so I hope those of you who´d like to hear from me more often will forgive me for enjoying it as much as I can at the moment.   I promise I will write more tomorrow and tell you guys more of how I´m feeling and what I´m doing. I promise !

       Moving here, moving there, moving everywhere  Everything... everyone is moving around me. And in two weeks I will be too. It seems as if all I´ve done for the past few days is carry boxes around. We helped my sister and her husband move this weekend and also had a  fantastic  time in München. It was so needed to get away for a while, and even more because Justin had to move out of his place all of a sudden today. We just finished giving his keys back and now we´re trying to figure out what to do with our evening. Both a bit worn out...   And my time will end soon. The new Au-Pair is coming for a visit this weekend and I must admit I´m quite excited about meeting her. I have a feeling that she´s nice. It also makes me think back on the time when I first came here and how it all seemed and how it all seems completely different now. I for instance never thought I would stay in Germany. But I am going to. Next Monday I will hopefully be able to send my university applications away and next week I will also have to start to studying for the language test. Yeap, I´m taking a german test on the 26th of June. Quite stressed about it because I am not at all sure how good my german is, but I suppose I will find out soon enough.

       Butterflies in my stoumache.   Should be packing, but I decided to write first. Very excited about this weekend. Very much need this weekend.    That's where I'll be in a few hours. In München. For the first time ever :) In 3 hours Justin and I will get on that train. In 6 hours we will arrive at München Hauptbahnhof and there we will be greeted by my favorite redhead.  Haven't seen my sister since I went back to Germany on the 5th of January. And I haven't watched Eurovision with her for many years ;) It's going to be a nice weekend. No doubt about it.

      I'm hungry. Starving actually. Wondering why I didn't eat when I had the chance. Now it's almost 1 and I'm on my way to bed and my growling stoumache will just have to wait until tomorrow.  It was a lazy dazed weekend. I slept a whole lot and can't say I did much of concequence. But then again, I needed the space, time and rest for my brain, and I needed to gather my energy for the upcoming weeks that won't be lazy dazed at all.  I am procrastinating a bit at the moment and I want to kick myself for it. But then again, that's nothing new when I'm concerned.   Going to bed now. Sounds like a good idea, and one that will make tomorrow more productive.

       Praise the gods   I got a job for the summer. I actually got a job from the time when I come home, to mid-September when I hopefully go back here to study.  I am going to be working at Skogarbaer, taking care of old people. I am very enthusiastic about it .I have worked so much with children that it will be a great experience to work with old people. Very, very happy =) !!!

       I guess it's time to show a bit of colour and write a bit  Spent my evening at German class and then eating spagetti and drinking redwine with Justin. It was somehow a very exhausted evening, but it will therefore be even more rewarding to go to bed in a sec.  I have a British accent. It's hilarious and sometimes I surprise myself, but it's a nice change. At least I know a few people who'll think it's positive =)   On Mondays like these  If I could, I would write songs about Mondays.Seriously. There is nothing nicer than my Mondays. Usually spent cleaning and running errands with Justin, it seems to be the most carefree and fun day of my week. The weekends seems to demand that one has fun. Mondays on the other hand are supposed to be boring. I hardly work on Mondays so mine are glorious.   The weekend was alright  It wasn't quite what I'd expected it to be, but then again, I had some stuff on my mind. It got sorted out though.  Saturday I did manage to buy a beautiful dress and a handmade green scarf for 2 Euros at a fleamarket. I admit, I love clothes. At the moment my passion is mostly for second hand clothes though. Makes my half empty wallet very happy.  Saturdaynight we went to a concert at the WCM and saw this really cool band called Braindance, which I have unfortunatly not been able to find anything about on the internet for you guys. Will do my best to bring one of their CD's with me home though. They are to be appriciated.   Sunday Justin and I babysitted 4 boys together, Dominik being one of them, and not to be forgotten all the neighbourkids that came around as well. It was fun. Lots of fun and we are looking forward to going back there again next weekend. I am going to miss working with children when I go to university. But I have a feeling that later in my life one may find me teaching. Something, somewhere. I just had a vision ;)

      One might expect me to announce the death of my blog now. Seeing that it's been almost 3 weeks since I wrote anything. In fact I am starting to wonder if anyone has tolerance with me anymore and checks weither I write or not.   It's Friday. It's going to rain within the next hour but I am excited about this weekend, even if nothing special is happening. Maybe it's exactly for that reason that I am excited. I have a hundred things on my mind these days and I need a quiet weekend to sort out my head and make somekind of a plan for the rest of my time here.  A little bit over a month until I stop working here, and 7 weeks till I fly home. Somehow I try not to think about it too much, even if I can't avoid doing so.   I guess I'll just open the closet, step out of it, and tell you what I am so busy doing those spare moments I'm home and not working. I am getting ready to send off my applications. I am going to apply for university here in Germany and it is quite complicated. Not surprising seeing that I am living in the country that invented bureaucracy.  At this point some people might be wondering what I am planning to study. It's called Ethnology and it is really cool and interesting. I've been really stressed and worried about this whole application process lately, testing poor Justin's patience with my worries, but after recieving my studentsprof (high-school diploma) yesterday I got really motivated. I can do this. I know I can because I want it bad enough. It's really nice to feel this determined motivation in my heart again .  Otherwise, I am great. Will be going to see some art tomorrow at the  urlLink WCM  and then on Sunday Justin will assist me babysitting 4 children while Stefan,Stephi and their friends go dancing. Otherwise I am just going to have a beer, sleep in, read and relax.

       Eurovision...   My god. Just watched the  urlLink Icelandic    urlLink German  Eurovision songs. It was sad. Just sad. First of all, the Icelandic video is really bad. I dislike her, but I must say that she usually is kind of cute. In the video she just looks bad. Too much makeup, too much light, too set up somehow.  As for the German video... nahja... it's as bad as the song, and those of you who will watch Eurovision will understand why the video is a cartoon when they the singer . Both Iceland and Germany have great musicians. Why do they have to put such crap songs to the contest???!

      Its alive !!! Tired, but well. Sitting at a fancy hotel in Copenhagen, Justin just gone to bed and me looking forward to my shower and sleep when I finish this entry.  Technically we were supposed to leave Greenland yesterday. But the plane broke down and had to return to Denmark after a while, so it never came to pick us up. It was actually good that we stayed one more day because they were working until 2 on Fridaynight and it was nice to have one extra day to relax with each other.  It was great. But exhausting. Very different from my last impression of Greenland. There was sunshine and about 15 degrees (Celcius) almost every day, a nice breeze and more mosquitos than I have EVER encountered in my life. Those who have travelled with me know Im quite allergic to them. It was very bad this time and I am happy to be free from those flying killing machines. But in some aspects I will miss Greenland. I definetly hope I will get a chance to go back.   I am exhausted... did I mention that before?! and I am looking forward to seeing my mom. A lot. It´s funny how I miss her more and more now that I get closer to meeting her. She is in Munchen right now with my sister. Justin and I will be there in a couple of days as well. Joy Joy ! I am really looking forward to returning to Germany. Not looking forward to my test on Thursday, but I feel like I am going "home" to Germany in a way and it makes me feel very good about my choice to study there.  Sent out 8 university application the day I left Germany. Someone will get hurt if I dont get in somewhere.   Well, this was me, showing a sign of life again. I hope you havent forgotten about my blog for these 3 weeks.

       Going once, going twice, GONE !  Moving out in half an hour. My train leaving in an hour and a half. Stress-level high and luggage... HEAVY ! But I am fine. I am excited. Tired and hungry as well, but I will make it.   As you can imagine, this blog will be on vacation until I return at the end of the month.  I hope you won't forget about me though.

       It's good to be home.   The past 24 hours have been quite enough for me. An evening shift at work last night and a morning shift today. The shift last night was, to be honest, from hell, and the one this morning was only a little bit better.   I am wondering whether today is upside down or if it's just me.    But, I successfully got home with the bus. My pink velvet shoes are a bit wet though from the rain and I tore my bag on a doorknob on my way up the stairs.  This happened in the 3 minutes it takes me walk from the bus-stop. You can imagine how the rest of my day has been.   I don't feel very relaxed, but I am nevertheless going to lie down in bed and see if I can't fall asleep for about an hour. Tonight my mom, my sister and I are invited to dinner at  urlLink Guja's  house. She unfortunatly is in England singing, so her parents will be our hosts for the evening. I wish she could come over though ;)

       Late nights  Someday I will have to learn that it's healthy to go to bed around midnight and wake up at 9.  Going to bed at 3 and waking up at noon is just as much sleep, but most people would agree that it's not very productive.  I don't know why I just cannot go to sleep when I'm home. It's just the way it is. I like being alone so late at night, knowing that most people are asleep and I can peacefully do my thing and relax.   So, now it's one in the afternoon and I'm still in my PJ's, just had a wonderful homemade latte and some breakfast. The shower is waiting for me, and then I might watch a movie with my sister before I go to work at 3:30.    Today is good. I had a great trip to a café with my friends last night, slept well, and have a day off tomorrow. Oh, it will be wonderful. Work was also very hectic yesterday and I'm in a great need of a break. Which I am getting soon.

       I'm back.   And I appologize for the fact that I haven't written a decent entry in a long, long time. My cousin told me that my blog had been in a coma since I went to Greenland. She's right and I'm planning to do something about that. I'm actually not so sure how many people still bother to check if I've written anything.   Just came home from work, had milk and watched Sex in the City. A perfect way to relax after quite a hectic and mentally difficult shift at work.  I do like work though and this was the first really hard shift. It's a very giving job and I enjoy it a lot. Even started wondering this evening if I should become a nurse or something in those lines. But it was just a thought. I'm quite happy with what I chose to study.   It was a PARTY weekend. It's been a long time since I've partied this much and it was a whole lot of fun. And it's really nice to see so many people that one knows. Just go downtown Reykjavik and guaranteed one will bump into dozens of old friends.  Fridaynight I went to two concerts. One at Café Kulture and the other one was a Megas  Sukkat concert at Grand Rokk. Both concerts were brilliant, but being at a Megasukk concert with Brynhildur was an amazing experience. We concider ourselves the official Sukkat fan club since our Interrail with Guja last summer. And of course they played our favorite song. It was just... indescribable.   Last night wasn't quite as exciting as Fridaynight, but I had fun nevertheless. Went to a party and saw loads of people I haven't seen for almost 2 years, and then we went downtown to find a place to dance. We didn't really succeed and I came home at 4:30, a bit more fluffy than I'd planned to be.   And I didn't feel too good when I woke up. But, I made a call to a far away place and it made things a whole lot better ;)

       No news is good news... or?!  Had Monday off. Slept in, had a relaxing day and then had a really lovely evening with my friends. Brynhildur is in town ! After uncountable hours on the phone with her the past 9 months, it was wonderful to see her in person again and just... ay... she's so sweet and so very funny.   Got yet another positive reply yesterday. This time from the university in Würzburg. For those who do not know where that is, it's in Bavaria and it's a really nice city. We'll see what the future brings :)  I was working from 15:30 to 23:30 yesterday. It's an interesting shift somehow... Strange time to work on because you sleep all morning, go to work and then come home to sleep again. It makes very little of ones social life, but I am really enjoying work, so it's alright.   My sister is coming home next week !!! Joy Joy Joy !!!

       Public transport ...  in Reykjavik is so bad. I had to wait half an hour for the bus, and then change the bus once before I got home, over an hour after I finished working. Which, might not sound too bad, but it takes 5 minutes to drive to my work from here. And it takes more than half an hour to take the bus. Next week I'm going to grab my bike and catch some fresh air. Plus, I don't really like being so dependant on the busses here.   Have to work again tomorrow morning. And then I have Monday off. But in fact, I like working there. It's not as hard as I thought it would be, and my co-workers are nice. Waking up so early in the morning is horrid, but it always is.   No more university replies yet. But I'm hopeful and positive ... =)

       Another yes woke me up this morning.   The university of Nurnberg sayed yes to me too. 6 more replies to go. Praying that I will get more positive replies still.  Today was relaxing. Woke up at 1:30 when my mom came in and asked me if I wanted to open the letter from the university. She was probably excited and didn't want to open it for me. So she woke me up. Which isn't too bad because I don't really like sleeping in anymore. At least not so long. It feels like such a waste of the day, waking up so late and not having time to go anywhere or do anything. So, I got up, ate a banana and went out with my mom. She had a doctors appointment and I ran some errands.   Bought some contact lenses so I can see when I start work tomorrow. And I bought some organic, Austrian tea. Planning to have a cup before I go to bed. I am trying to alter my eating habits. I've heared that I eat too much chocolate and sweets and should "eat my salat"... I actually should eat more healthy in general. And I am hoping I'll be able to bike to work on and off. I'd say I'd be able to bike to work all the time but the Icelandic weather just isn't too friendly all the time.   First day tomorrow. Wake up before 7, so I can be there all fresh and ready at 8. My mom is going to drive me. I'm not too stressed about it, haven't actually thought about it too much.  Just going to go there and do my best. Wish me luck... ;)

       Iceland...  I am here. Since late Sundaynight. And it is sweet.   I wasn't looking forward to coming home at all. Quite honestly, if I had had a choice, I would have stayed in Germany. But here I have a job, and a place to live, so it was obvious that I would go home.  And, now that I am here, I am happy. It is nice. A bit cold, but the ocean wind is wonderful and the smell of summer here is so fresh.   I start working at the nursing home on Thursdaymorning. I will be working at a normal ward and at an Alzheimer ward. I am getting a bit tense about it, starting a new job like this, but I am also happy I have a job and looking forward to getting to know new people and to do something different.   I got a letter this morning. Admission to the Munich University. My first yes into a german university. I wasn't sure I'd get in anywhere, me not being Ms. Positive. My goal was to get in at least at one university. The university in Munich isn't my first choice, but now that I've gotten in there, I am more positive about the replies from the other universities. To be honest, I'm quite proud of myself at the moment. And I am happy to be able to say that I will return to Germany. I will return to be a student =) I am going to university !!! yahoo !!!

       Nice, nice day   Slept till noon. Had breakfast, took a shower and did the dishes. Felt blissful not to have to go anywhere or do anything. Called  urlLink GUJA  and we went to the mall and then to the movies. Bought a couple of T-shirts and a pair of socks. A black Tee and a green one. And the socks are striped. For those who know me, these purchases are no surprise :)   We went to see Bruce Almighty. Not exactly what I'd usual go to, but I got 2 tickets when I bought my computer so I used them. It was one of those movies that's so stupid that you can't help laughing. And I laughed a lot. I am actually beginning to appriciate comedies. I didn't used to like them. Now I just laugh. It's nice.   I needed today. Yesterday was a bit dreadful. I don't like incompetent officials. Got enough of those yesterday. But that was...yesterday... and we´ll leave it in the past.   An observant person might have noticed that I've been reading the same book and listening to the same CD for quite a while. No, I haven't forgotten to update it. Le Petit Prince is  the  book lying on my nightstand and since Greenland, I really haven't listened to anything but Travis. How happy I was to find that a new album is coming in just a few weeks.

       Extremely tedious  Been E-mailing my files from our PC to my laptop. We have a slow dial-up connection so it's been taking forever. I'm slowly loosing my mind and think I'm giving up for the evening.   Otherwise it was a great day. I woke up early when my sister called, had breakfast and then fell asleep again and had an amazing, peaceful sleep passed noon. Had some errands to run and then I had a special massage...Höfuð-,beina- og spjaldhryggsjöfnun, which might translate into a cranium equalizer. Correct me if I'm wrong. I have no idea what I'm talking about. All I do know is that it makes my system feel better.   I had a great dinner with my mom, steak, feta salat and Nederburger redwine from South Africa. It tasted magical, after not having dinner at home for over a week or more.   And I talked to my Justin for quite a while. It was wonderful. It is strange how I miss him more and more now that it draws closer to the day when I will see him again. That will be a nice day.

       Another late night     Just watched L.A. Confidential and realised that Guy Pearce is just... too handsome for his own good! Spent the passed 10 minutes surfing, trying to find the right picture to put here.  I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed it.  Plus, it was a great movie. Surprised I hadn't seen it before.   I hope I won't have any early classes this winter. I don't like waking up in the morning.  In exactly 12 hours I have work again. In this time I have planned to sleep, eat and clean my room. Don't think I'll make it, but at least I'm going to try.  Which means I have to go to bed now.

       An earthquake  and I missed it... I was too busy goofing around with my friends at a party. Maybe just as well. Earthquakes really scare me after the one we had 17.6 2000.   I was out partying. I'm sober and home. In bed with the computer again.  I guess I had fun. I met  urlLink Svanur  and  urlLink Guja  and that's always fun. The three of us are...what shall I say...interesting together.   We went downtown and it wasn't so great. I don't like having my ass grabbed or guys asking me if I'll go home with them. And I shouldn't. It's disgusting.  I bought myself a kebab and grabbed a cap home.   Today was good. I got into Uni Tübingen and I got the results from my german test in June. I passed it with flying colours.  I feel quite brilliant about that =)

       Blogging in bed  It's quite a glorious thing. Isn't that every Internet addicts dream? Being able to surf the net in bed... ? Well, I have to admit that I never dreamt this would happen. And I don't know if I'm going to make a habit of taking my computer to bed with me, but I have to admit it's kind of cosy.  Sleeping is also cosy. I just haven't done much of that since the laptop moved in with me.   I got in at Uni Mannheim. And the back of my hands still hurt. What is most embarrasing about the whole thing is that I actually found the key to the mailbox. My mom had left it on the counter so I could open the mailbox if something arrived. And I almost tore off my hands...  You think I'm borderline now ? Well, I'm a bit stressed at the moment and not knowing exactly when I'm leaving and where I'm going does takes its toll on ones nerves. But I think I'm managing alright. I'm just obsessed with the mailbox.

       Wonderful   This is, if anything ever was. Me, in my own room, with my own computer and my own Internet connection.  I'm a happy camper right now.  Apart from the red marks on the back of my hands. They hurt. There's mail in our mailbox from the University in Mannheim. Mom´s not home so I don´t have the key to the mailbox. So I tried squeezing my hands in there and fish it out. Without any luck.   It's a thick envelope. I think it's another admission...   I wish mamma would come home soon. I at least wish I knew where she was and when she was coming home so I could stop thinking every car that passes is her.   I yet have to get a reply from the university I most of all want to go to. My hope is dwindeling.

       It's mine  And it's still in it's box, waiting for me to come home from work. I am also waiting. Can't wait to pick it out of it's box, turn it on and stay up until very late getting to know it.  Finally...after several years of wanting one, a laptop is mine. A Dell Inspiron 500m laptop is mine. And I'm happy :)

       Sundays  Just came home from meeting up with the girls from my old class. It was really nice seeing them and I hope I'll see them a few more times before I leave. I can be a lazy bum sometimes when it comes to communication. Maybe I should do something about that.   Last night was Reykjavik Culture Night. Wheather all the drunkeness I witnessed can be considered culture is debatable. Probably it can be considered Icelandic culture. Harpa invited me to a musical show, and afterwards we walked around downtown. Later I experienced the most spectacular fireworks I've ever seen. New Years Eve makes me cry  - ergo -  fireworks make me cry. This time was no exception. I just think nobody noticed.   I also realised that I will [probably] not be here for Christmas and New Years. So these were my fireworks for this year I guess. Germans don't seem to be so big on lighting up the sky to welcome the new year.   Soon I will have a roommate. A soulmate. I have fallen in love... with a laptop.  I have to have it. There's no way around it anymore... I've waited so long and now my chance is here. I've found the one! I'm sure there's someone out there who understands me.

       Yawning  ...rubbing my eyes, praying that next time I will look at my watch it will be time to run down, change and go home. I'm at work.  I woke up at nine this morning. It was my own free will. And then...I had my hair cut. Only a tiny little bit, but it looks a lot nicer now. I haven't had a haircut for almost a year now. It was worth waking up for.   Got another YES from a university today. This time it was  urlLink Catholic University in Eichstaett . Only 4 more replies to go. Still praying those will be positive too because I still haven't gotten a reply from the university I'd most like to go to.   Otherwise...I'm gone... zzzzzzzzzz

       Busy days  To say the least. Tuesdaynight I was babysitting my cousins with my mom. They are absolute cuties and it was really nice having them around.  After work on Wednesday I again napped (yes.. I love my siesta) and then I went to a family birthday party. Wasn't exactly the most fun thing I've ever done, but afterwards we went  urlLink here  to watch candles being rafted on the city pond. This event was in memory of those who lost their lives in Hiroshima 1945.  I've wanted to go every year, and this time I did. It was quite moving.   Thursday was a day I'd like to forget. 12 hours of work, thereof a 8 hours shift that almost drove me insane. I don't like working with lazy bums. It makes me aggressive and stressed.  I remember few times where I've been this frustrated. And I couldn't hide it.  I worked from 8-16 and then from 18-22. In between I of course squeezed my beloved nap, and fortunatly showed up smiling at the second shift. And I actually enjoyed it, but then again, I was working with good people. Thank god nobody at work knows this link...   Yesterday I had a massage from hell. So much from hell that I couldn't fall asleep last night and I feel like I did 300 sit ups yesterday. I'm going again next Friday. I'm a masocist. It's official now.   And today I was proud. Wet  proud. I finally got to experience Reykjavik Gay Pride !!! And even if I had to wait for the bus for an hour and then get completely wet in the rain, it was worth it. I hope I will be home next year again. Iceland is fun... and I'm going out tonight to enjoy it =)

       Exhausted  I napped for an hour after work. It hurt my heart to wake up again. I realise that I'm exhausted because I slept 4 hours and some odd minutes last night.  I felt like writing a letter when I got to bed last night. So I did. 6 pages of a letter and then I was able to fall asleep.   E-mails are nice. Especially from people you rarely get E-mails from. Long, thick, friendly E-mails. My mailbox has been recieving a few of those lately. It makes my days at work a little bit better.  Junk mail on the other hand has really been annoying me. It is so frustrating to see the "You've got new mail" and then check the Inbox and only find mails filled with info about Viagra, how I can get a great loan and a lot of other stuff I won't get into here.  It is extremely frustrating.   I'm not exactly positive today. Maybe you noticed. It just doesn't seem to be my day. A perfect day to be cynical. My mom thought it was funny. I couldn't agree. I even barked at my co-workers today. Kept the smile around the old people though.   Not sleeping enough probably didn't help. And my mom woke me up, all stressed, telling me that it was 8:15 and that I was late. Infact it was only 7:15 and I was enjoying my snooze to the fullest. I don't like when people wake me up. I have to feel like I'm getting up because  I  want to. Not that I often really WANT to get up at 7. But tomorrow I will do so again.   It's called working. It's alright, but I am looking forward to being a student again.

       Absolutely brilliant  Yesterday was a day to remember. The weather was beautiful, the concert was nice and then my mom surprised me with dinner at a lovely restaurant by the sea. Ate lobster for the second time in my life and  looked at the Atlantic  wondered where I'd end up if I jumped in and started swimming.   It always gives me a strange feeling, looking at the ocean and realizing where I am. On a little island somewhere way up north. Yesterday it was a nice strange feeling.  Maybe I'm learning to appriciate all this after spending 9 months in the center of a continent.   When I came back into town, I got a phonecall and an invitation to a party. It took me 45 minutes to decide what to wear. It would have been a funny scene to watch. Me in a hurry, ripping clothes out of my closet, throwing them around and then... in the end, when my mom was already in the car, running inside again to put on what was at the bottom of the pile.  I don't know what happened, but this seems to be my new thing. Changing clothes at least 3 times before I'm happy. Even when I'm just going to work. It's kind of annoying.   My night was absolutely brilliant ! I haven't had so much fun in ages. After the party we went downtown and I pretty much met everyone I wanted to meet. Danced, laughed, had a few beers and danced some more.  Achievment of the night was without a doubt sharing a restroom with 6 other girls. There of only  urlLink one  I know. Absolutely hilarious. One of those things I'd love to have on film.   Came home with the sunrise. And the sun is still shining.

       Sleeping in is the best thing in the world  Especially after a week like the last, that was a bit stressful at work.  My sister flew away late Thursdaynight. Me and my mom cried her away. And I'm the one that will see her soon. But I still had to cry. She was only home for 2 weeks so I hadn't gotten enough of her yet ;) oh... she's such a sweetheart. I'm going to miss her, but I will see her this fall when I return to Germany. At least I will have to go to pick up all my stuff that I have in storage in her cellar. I have too much stuff. And too many clothes. No matter how I try to cut down, I always have to much. Everywhere.   I got payed yesterday. Lots and lots of money. Of course went out and spent some of it right away and am going to continue to do so today. It's just the way it is when a new month begins. One goes out and buys all the stuff one needs. But it's incredible how expensive Iceland is. On a short trip to the crappy plaza here in Gardabaer I spent a 100Euros.  But then again, I went to the pharmacy and medication is not subsidized here. It's simply just expensive.  In addition I bough 3 CD's. Eniga Meniga, Studmenn and XXX Rottweiler. I'm starting a collection of Icelandic music so I can survive in Germany. I craved for Icelandic music in Heidenheim. Brynhildur saved me when she sent me a Sukkat tape for my birthday. It obviously doesn't take much to save me :)  This afternoon my mom and I are going to a baroque concert in  urlLink Skalholt . It will be nice to get out of town for a while.   Hope you are having a good weekend.

       My life as an internet addict  It´s been 24 hours and I´m back. Not at an internet cafe though. Im at the library in Herbrechtigen, the village where Justin lives, and I just got a student card which enables me to go to the internet here for free. Very nice indeed.   Going to Tübingen tomorrow. Called my (hopefully)flatmate-to-be yesterday and I´m going to stay at her place for the night. Then I will come back here on Thursday, pack my stuff, grab Justin with me and move to Tübingen on Friday. I hope it will all work out.   I don´t feel too grand today. Nevertheless I´m going into Heidenheim soon, to pick up my photos from this summer and run some errands. This afternoon I am going to take a nap. That´s my carrot for the day ;)  Tried to get a mobile number yesterday. Couldn´t get one because I don´t have a permanent address yet. I don´t like it when things don´t go my way. I´m getting used to it though.

      Im here. Alive and alright. A bit confused in what to do and how to use my time, but that will work out somehow.  Realising that its almost impossible to live without an internet connection. Seriously, there is no way to be productive when there isnt any internet.   And theres no easy way to get to Tuebingen quick and cheap.   But... I have a place to stay until then. Im living at Justin's place at the moment, 3 hours with the train from Tübingen. Its so sweet to be together again... Its so sweet to have someone who takes SUCH good care of me ;)   Well, my internet time is almost over. Got to go...

       At Kastrup  Just had to try this wireless thing. Probably going to cost a bit, but it's worth it. Everything went well, I am already checked in and ready to step on my plane to Munich that will start boarding in 2 minutes.   Some of you might be wondering how I feel. Not much actually. I'm tired. I've had a VERY big Carlsberg and I'm just looking forward to seeing Justin at the airport.   I miss my mom and my friends already. Æi, ég á eftir að sakna ykkar voða voða voða mikið... en, góðu fréttirnar eru þær að ég kem heim um jólin.  Ef ekki, þá má lemja mig mjög fast í hausinn þegar ég kem heim næst.   A big hug to all of you from the lonely traveller.

       Just one more day  For the next 50 years I'll have a drivers licence. It's crazy but true. I never thought I'd make it this far, but I did and I'm happy.  Went to the airport tonight with Guja and Hjorvar. We found a really pretty mexican girl there. We took her with us and showed her the northen lights. We also saw a building on fire.   It's been an interesting evening.   In about 28 hours I'll be waking up to go to the airport again. And I'll be leaving.  I go from crying about it to being excited. Don't really know what to feel.   Still don't know if I'll manage to catch my connecting flight from Copenhagen to Munich. I have to get my luggage, have my ticket re-issued and check in for the flight in 2 hours and 20 minutes. It will be interesting and stressful. Lets just pray there won't be any delays.   Justin is going to pick me up. I think he's an absolute sweetheart for doing so.  It makes my life a little bit easier at the moment, knowing that I don't have to spend over 2 hours on a train when I get to Germany.

      I like the telephone It made me a happy girl today. Naturally it matters who one is talking to as well.  It's strange how some friendships are just timeless. 2 hours on the phone with this quite nice friend of mine was exactly what I needed today. I smiled 2 hours straight. Seriously. My jaws  my dimples hurt ... :)  Today was generally just good ;) Started out by not having to pay anything on the bus this morning. Evidently nobody had to. After a bit of pain at the physiotherapists, I met up with Guja and we had coffee, talked, laughed and had some fun. Which is usually what we do when we're together. They are such nice girls. I'm going to miss them... snuff, snuff...  Might be home for X-mas though to see them. Don't tell anyone... it's a secret ;)

       It was fun  I suffered from a grand hangover yesterday and had to wash a lot of wineglasses.  But it was worth it. It was one of those nights to remember. Just good friends, good wine and good fun.   The weather is incredible. Stops me from sleeping proporly. I usually sleep until I wake up(makes sense doesn't it?), but lately I'm waking up several times a night, just to panic, feel scared and calm myself back to sleep. I don't understand.   I don't understand a whole lot of things these days. But I know it is nice to sit here in bed with the computer, listen to the news on the radio and my mom grading tests.

       Another good day  I bet it's the attitude that matters. And the fact that I'm getting enough sleep.   Went to university today. Had lunch with my friends and then attended a class with them. It was fun to be a student in Iceland for a day.   And it made me look forward to the start of my own studies. Studying is fun. I've forgotten how much fun it is to be a student. Not the easiest task all the time, but ... most of the time ;)  It most certainly beats working 8 hours a day at a job you don't really like.   Now I'm going to bed with a book. And I'm going to read as long as I want.  I don't have anything to do tomorrow.

       Today  ...is a good day. Anniversaries are nice. Would be nicer if I had my guy to celebrate with me. Half a year of 'us' today. Not such a long time, but we're working on it :)  10 days till I leave. Got busy today and sorted out my papers. And went on a quick shopping spree at the mall. It's incredible how much money one can spend in an hour.   Travis is a great band. Have I mentioned that before? Definetly going to buy their new CD as well as their first CD at the Duty Free when I leave.   I just finished a very long conversation with my mom so I think I'm out of words for the day.   I hope you excuse me.   By the way...does anyone have a clue how I can change the size and color of my links-font?

       Leaving depression  It might sound strange coming from me - but I hate leaving. I'm in denial right now and I'm trying my best to stay focused but somehow all the things I still have to do are just piling up infront of me. It's scary.  Last night was so lovely that it made me wonder why on earth I am going to Germany.   But I still want to go. For some reason or another. I'm not quite clear about my motives at the moment, but deep down I must admit that I'm still looking forward to going back.   Even if it will be hard.

       Me, the housewife  Yes. Today I was a housewife. My mom only has one hand functioning at the moment so I filled in. And now that I've pretty much fulfilled my duties for the day, I actually think I succeeded. We had a nice dinner, the kitchen is fairly clean and no disaster has hit yet.   And I'm going out. Going to a movie with a certain  urlLink apalingur  and then meeting up with our friends later =) Nice.   2 weeks to go. Don't necessarily want to leave but I have to admit I am really, really, really, really looking forward to seeing my Justin again. It's so hard to be apart.

       Today I remember why I'm moving to Germany  It's not even mid September yet and the weather stinks. Storm, rain...cold... And of course this was exactly the morning I couldn't sleep in. I had to wake up at 8 to take the bus to my physiotherapist.  I swear, I think he doesn't like me. At least he seriously tortures me every time I lie down on that bench.   I had planned to go downtown, maybe check out  urlLink the university  and see if I found some nice people to talk to. Due to the weather, I seriously cannot be bothered.   My socks are wet, I'm hungry and sleepy and I think I'm going to crawl into bed with the newspaper for an hour or two.   Positive side of it all : it's a perfect day to stay in and do all the things one should have done weeks ago. And be happy about it because the last thing one wants is to go outside.

       Vacation  From today until mid October (when I start uni) I am on vacation. I quit my job today.  Only had 3 shifts left, this weekend, but it was time. Plus, my mom is having a small operation on Friday and I'd prefer to be around over the weekend to help her.   And I'd gotten enough from working. It's been a year and a half since I've had a decent break.   I've dealt with the drama. Taken necessary measurements like watching a teen-movie, eat lots of candy and go shopping. Feel fine. Sleepy but fine.   Tonight I'm going to see to Judith Hermann (german author) with my mom. I've read endless interviews with that woman and it'll be interesting meeting her.   Highlight of the week: Watching the game between Iceland and then having a beer with 3 of the german players in the evening.

       Dramatic days  My life has been sweet and simple for the past half a year that I've forgotten how it is when everything gets dramatic.  And it most certaintly did.  The good news is that I'm dealing with it. Only cried once in the past 24 hours, haven't gotten furious yet and I've manage to remain cool, calm and composed.    I'm seriously wondering if I'm about to loose my  Miss Dramaqueen   title. Doubt it though.

       Why not  24 hours of changes. Confusion, tears, sleeplessness and at last - me content with my choice.   I'm going to the  urlLink University in Tübingen.  It has been voted upon by the board and accepted.  I found out last night that the university that I was planning to go to really wasn't so good. Uni Tübingen on the other hand is one of the best universities to study Education at. And they already admitted me, so...that's where I'm going.  It was a hard decision because Augsburg is so nicely close to my sister and Justin. But naturally they both want me to go to a good university, and 3 hours with a train is much better than a 3 hour flight from Iceland... ;)  Yeah, I'm recovering. At least I'm positive again. And truly, truly enthusiastic about my university.

       Map of Copenhagen Airport  I need a better one than they have on their homepage. Is their anyone out there that can tell me wheather I'll manage getting out of an Iceland Express plane, pick up my luggage and my bike and get myself on an SAS plane in 2 hours?!  I'm doubting it myself. Found out today that I can't book my luggage all the way because I'm travelling with Iceland Express. It sucks. It means I might have to leave my bike behind this time. Which almost makes me cry because I've been waiting so long to introduce the streets of Germany to my bike and me.   My illness keeps changing. It began with a throat ache 2 days ago. Yesterday it was a headache from hell. And today, I'm coughing and sneezing. Wonder what will happen tomorrow.... Preferably I'll become healthy again, but I think that's a bit too much to ask at the moment.

       I'm sick  I feel like I got hit in the head with a baseball bat and run over by a truck. I survived work last night, but have been feeling worse by the hour today.   Called in sick tomorrow. No way I'll be in any state to work.   Otherwise, talked to Justin for a long,long time when I woke up today. We both needed it. It wasn't the cheerfullest of phonecalls because we both have lots of worries at the moment, but we managed to give each other a pep talk.  Thing is, it always works out in the end. One way or the other.  It's just waiting for it to do so that's hard.   It is nice having him back in Germany and be able to have a real conversation on the phone.   And I might have gotten a room in Augsburg. Not certain yet but I'm crossing my fingers.

       Positivity isn't my strong point today  Actually, I feel miserable. Couldn't fall asleep last night, and when I finally did, I didn't sleep well.   Woke up to recieve an E-mail saying that I didn't get the apartment I wanted in Augsburg.  Don't know what to do now. Feel a bit hopeless, especially because I haven't even recieved admission at that university yet.   And I'm coming down with something. I feel like I have a tennisball stuck in my throat and I have a bit of a temperature.  And I'm going to work.   Seriously. Today really sucks.

       hummm  In an inbetween mood. My boyfriend is somewhere in an airplane, flying over Africa. It's absurd and I wish he wasn't. Won't hear from him until sometime tomorrow and it's hard just having to wait. I'm not afraid of flying. I just don't like the thought of my boyfriend somewhere high above the Sahara.   It's not my day of being positive. Even if it's actually been quite a good day. Went to my physiotherapist, then to a café with Harpa, home, napped and went to a farewell gathering at Edda's place.   Amazing how Icelandic people can never stay at home. Everyone is going someplace or coming from somewhere.  And so am I.   At the moment I don't like it. I don't wanna stay here either. I wish things could just be settled. Wish I could be settled. Wondering if I ever will be.  Wish my certain someone was here to hold me.

       Thursdays  Are strange. Are the days when I should be studying as hard as I can. Using my time because I dont have any classes. But I havent done anything today. Finished reading a Paul Auster book and did some laundry. And for the past hour and a half Ive been here, at the library, catching up on my internet life.   A friend of mine looked at me yesterday and asked me if I was in panic. I sayed yes. How he noticed remains a mystery to me. I always think I looked cool, calm and composed.   Read my first batch of ethnologie papers this week and it scared me. I am not so sure Im going to make it. Its very scary stuff. It would be scary in Icelandic. Reading it in German makes it a million times worse.   Then I went to class and was supposed to be able to talk wisely about what I had read.  I sat there and couldnt say a thing. Not a single thing. I couldnt even say that I didnt understand a thing. I was silent for almost 2 hours. Its a rare happening.    Yeah, Im in a state of panic.   Otherwise, everything is fine. At least it seems like that from the outside. I cant really complain. Apart from not understanding anything of course.   Coming home for Christmas on the 18th of December. Did I already tell you that?  And tomorrow its weekend again. I will be on the train, waiting almost 3 hours in anticipation, until I pass Giengen, know that the next stop is Herbrechtingen and Justin is standing there waiting for me.

       Already Saturday  And Im sitting in Herbrechtingen, in this wonderful little library in the old convent, waiting for my sister to arrive.   She is bringing me my stuff that I left at her place in June. Amongst those things are my warm clothes, my coat and my books.  Im very excited at the moment. Excited to see her and to get my stuff and really grateful thats she is driving all this way to bring it to me.   I left right after my lecture yesterday. Broke most of my personal rules by having lunch at McDonalds, picked up 450 pages of ethnology readings and jumped on the train.   It was another strange week. Im just a bit lost somehow. And I feel lonely, even if I have no reason to feel that way. It is so good to come here in the weekends. Its so nice to see Justin and just to be here in this little village, relaxing, preparing for the coming week.   I need a cup of coffee. And I need to reply  A LOT of E-mails, but the library is closing in 5 minutes so I doubt I will be able to do that.

      Amazon is a great place.  Bought some books and soon I will be able spend all my time reading.   I should have complained a little more yesterday about having nothing to do.  Soon, I will have more than enough to do.   First on my list = Learn propor German.  I am still unable to sound intelligent and well-read in German. It bothers me, especially now that I will have to start showing my professor that I am not as silly as I seem to be.

       Shoot me  Just had my first proseminar in ethnology. For those who don´t know what that is, it is a sort of a discussion class, usually connected to the weekly lecture.   My professor is tough. He is very interesting, but definetly not someone you want to rub the wrong way. And... this won´t be easy. He sayed that half of us would still be there for the second semester.   He reminds me of Arni Indrida, my old history teacher. Unfortunatly he doesnt have Arni´s looks. They both scare me. At the moment I´m terrified of prof.Hauschild. I think I´m going to turn into dust when he askes me something.   Yes, I am quite nervous at the moment. But I´m going to do my best and I´m going to make it...

       Tuesday  The weekends over and now study life is starting for real. Had my first full day yesterday and tomorrow I will start my first course at 9 and end my last course 12 hours later.  Actually Im looking forward to it. Right now I feel a bit disorientated and I dont quite know what to do with my time.   I dont like it. I always have the feeling I should be doing something, I just dont know what.   My weekend was nice. Very, very nice. I spent some quality time with Justin, relaxed and recharged my batteries. Didnt come back until yesterday, but I think thats how Im going to do it. Sitting alone on a train on Sunday nights just isnt my idea of fun.   I dont like Sunday nights. Its the most depressing time of the week.   Not having internet at home is driving me crazy. It makes me feel so limited, so out of touch, so cut away from the world. It might not be a real, primary need, but I am really starting to wonder wheater I should splurge on an internet connection.   I should go though. Its already late and I have lots of stuff to do.

       Weekend  And a content me. Just went to my first ethnology lecture. It was satisfying. I cant tell you what the professor talked about because it was complicated and I had a real hard time taking notes, but I think its all just practice.   Last night I came home too late. And I had a beer too much. But I had fun, which is the most important thing. And now Im gonna go home, pack and then Im leaving at 4 to see my Justin.   So... Im gonna run now. Have a good weekend.

       wow...   Computer stuff is complicated in English. In German its about 10 times more difficult for me to understand. All I want is to be able to use my laptop to go to the internet. I actually realised just now that I managed to do so earlier but the connection was really, really slow and I somehow have a feeling theres something more I should do.  Im also starting to wonder if I shouldnt just get a DSL connection at home.   Life without internet is hard. Seriously very hard. Addictions usually are.   My weekend was good. I wasnt planning to go to see Justin until Sunday, but on Friday afternoon I was worn out, and Theda (my flatmate) was driving towards Ulm, so I caught a ride halfway. German trains are almost always late. It really sucks and almost made me miss the last train to Herbrechtingen. Fortunatly I made it and was greeted by a smiling Justin and a candlelight dinner.   Saturdaynight I worked 9 hours. It was Heidenheim Museums Night and the restaurant where Justin works needed a extra pair of hands. So they used mine... I washed more glasses, plates and cuttlery than I have ever washed in my entire life. And had some fun too. We got home passed 3 in the morning, tired, but we made some good money so Im not gonna complaint.   I didnt get back to Tübingen until noon yesterday. Didn't have that much to do here so I stayed with Justin instead, especially because he had Monday off.   Yesterday there was an ethnology introduction and today an English introduction. Both sounded interesting, both got me a bit stressed, and both made me realise that now it is "schluss mit lustig".   I'm taking two majors. English and ethnology (called cultural anthropology in the US). Cant choose and dont want to. Think I will make it. Nevertheless... wish me luck :)

       My life as a foreigner...   Its strange. People think Im German. Even when I talk, people still think Im German. It usually takes a while and a few "humm, what was that word again" silences mistakes from me for people to realise that Im a foreigner. Except of course I have to spell my last name. I cant run and hide with a last name like mine.   It does bother me though somehow. No offense, but I dont want to be considered German. Cause Im not.    Anyhow. My orientation course isnt quite what I had expected it to be. Its actually a bit boring and my group isnt getting along too well either. The people Ive talked to the most are the 2 German tutors.  Most of the foreigners here are only here for a semester or two. Exchange students that have already started their studies. It will be nice to start my courses and meet other beginners somehow. People that speak German and will stay here for a longer time.   Agh, Im tired. Lots of things going on in my head and in my life at the moment and all Id like to do is to lie down in my bed and relax.   But Im going out tonight. Think its necessary to try make some friends ;)

       Weep   It was fully worth it to go all this way to the library to check my mails. Its been very long since Ive gotten so many nice E-mails in one day.  Im touched. Thanx =)  Its raining. Seriously raining. And I just came from a shopping trip. Nothing seemed to work like I wanted it to this morning. I didnt really know what to do with the rest of my day, so I decided to go to H and spend some money.   I dont really like shopping. And H scares me a little bit. But, today, I was in the right mood and was quite successful, as well as actually having fun.   Things are fine.  My room has begun to look like its owner (colourful and a bit caotic), I have some food in the fridge, did laundry yesterday, am now formally a student at the university and tomorrow I will start my orientation course.  Im really looking forward to it. It will be nice to get to know some people and try to understand how this system works.   Its just cold and raining. Apart from that, everything is fine =)

      Im back. And doing a bit better.Ive finished everything that I set out to do today and it all worked out perfectly. No stress, nobody mean to me and the weather is even nice. Very good.   Went out with Theda (my flatmate) last night, drank lots and lots of redwine and had a good time. Already getting to know some people. After my scary day I needed it.   Leaving back for Herbrechtingen in an hour and a half.Still trying to decide wheather I should come back tomorrow or on Saturday. Quite frankly there isn´t so much I can do here over the weekend, and my room doesn´t offer much privacy, so maybe I´ll just stay with Justin, enjoy a quiet weekend and come back on Saturday or Sunday. Mal kuggen.    By the way. Changed subjects. Going to study Ethnology .

      Scared... Just got to Tuebingen, sitting at an internet cafe. Been down to the university and basically its just big and scary. I will have to deal with my fears though because tomorrow I have a 105 things to sort out before I go back to sweet little Herbrechtingen at 3.  Did get a lot more payed from the nursing home than Id hoped for. Thats the bright point of the day.   I think I will go down to Neckarmuhl now and see if I cant relax a bit, have Tuebingens best beer and plan tomorrow.   It will be so wonderful to have Justin here with me over the weekend. Basically its just wonderful to have him. I dont know how Id be doing if I didnt.

       Sleepy  My internet addiction is strong. I actuallly woke up, put on the clothes I could find lying around the room and ran to the library before it closed, just to go to the internet.  But at least I'm up now, which is good =) But sleeping is just so nice. Especially late in November when it's cold and rainy outside  And I didn't get any new mail... exactly today, when I wake up extra to check it, there's nothing. Oh well... can't always be popular :)    Randomness:  I realised the other day that if I ever get pregnant (please don't think I am planning that in the near future though) , I will have to give up coffee for a while.  I am so bad in need of a cup of coffee right now, that I can't imagine ever having to deny myself of it.  But I'm sure under those circumstances, it's worth it ;)  I dreamt I was pregnant. It was very scary. At the end of the dream I had a 2 year old and a 3 year old running around me. I was happy to wake up and find that it was just a dream.   I also dreamt I was baking piparkökur (gingerbread?) with Guja. A little later my phone rang and Guja told me that we might actually do that, together with lots of nice people, when I come home.   Eg er alveg ad koma heim !!

       Books and movies  Am always reading a lot... and have lately been going to the movies and renting quite a few DVD's.  Paul Auster is a genius. I read the  Book of Illusions  recently and I am now reading  True Tales of American Life  at the moment. And I found out that high-school kids in Germany have to read  Moon Palace  in English. I think that's quite cool. They didn't seem to like it much though. But then again... they're german =P  Last week I saw The Matrix Revolutions and Luther. I never got around to seeing The Matrix Reloaded and therefore missed out on a step down... The Matrix Revolutions was just bad. So bad that half of the theather was lauging. It went overboard and was not to be saved. I loved the first one so it was a great dissappointment to me.   Luther was good.  It had great actors (Joseph Fiennes plays Luther... mmmm ;) and was just ...generally good made. I recommend it.   But now, I am going to use the rest of my library time to search for some books.  I'll be back tomorrow =)

       Ok.   Everything seems to be working out. At least for the time being.  Won't be able to start Nordistik (Scandinavian studies) or Epanish until next semester. My professor in Nordistik sayed that all I could do with my time until then was to read. Read as many books in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Icelandic as possible.   I am going to a meeting with my professor in spanish in 20 minutes. I know what he is going to say... read, read, read... and learn latin. I will have to take latin again. I am not thrilled about it because it is damn hard, but I do find it interesting, so it's not all bad.   This weekend though I am grounded with Henry Fielding's  Tom Jones .   Sounds fun doesn't it...all this reading? and apperantly LIN (Icelandic Student Loan Fund) isn't going to take my money away from me just yet.   So, it's so far so good.   Now wish me luck ;)

       Yeah.   Had a short  sweet day. Nevertheless a bit tired and worn. Maybe it is all the thinking that I am doing at the moment. And the fact that I had a few glasses of redwine last night and came home late.  Oh, it was fun. Went to Gudrun's place. She had just recieved a package from her sister in Iceland filled with candy, Sed and Icelandic Idol, that we are going to watch some time soon. Oh... all that candy. It was blizzful.   I must admit I get homesick sometimes. Having Gudrun here, as wonderfully Icelandic as she is, makes it all a lot better.  urlLink Gudrun  is a year older than me, blond, Icelandic and an exchange student here.  She likes Jet Black Joe, our presidents wife and she lives in Kopavogur. But, apart from those things she's alright =P  I am not studying ethnology anymore.  I can feel the shock that you are in, but it is a fact and my life has altered since I had my epiphany last week and made this decision.   It wasn't easy...and won't be easy, but at least my nightmares and stoumache aches because of ethnology are gone now.   Life is fine and I am again dealing with it in my cool, calm and composed manner... hehe ;) At least there isn't a storm in my mind anymore. Still a bit windy, but I can deal with that.   Going to the Mensa when I finish this entry to have dinner, then going to the store to buy supplies, home to watch Elizabeth on DVD and maybe I will find some time to clean my room a little bit and call my mom.   It will be nice to relax on a Tuesdaynight.

       Changes, new energy and positivity  Smile on my face and excitement about what is to come. I had a vision the other day. And I am following it, seeing if now, I might finally be content with what I am doing at university.   Had a quite confusing week. But now I am motivated and praying for the best.   Curious? Well... I will keep it that way for a while still. I myself am still realising what is happening.

       Dazed and confused  I have realised something. I am not a very philosophical person. And not very scientifical either.   I am pretty unsure about what I am studying at the moment. Ethnology that is. Apart from having great language problems and the department being  terror pur , I cant imagine myself dealing with all these theories Not that I dont find it interesting. Im just not sure it is what I want to be dealing with it for the next... very many years :)  And I sometimes wonder if I have been ignoring the fact that I enjoy studying languages and that I am good at it. Studying languages just doesnt seem very practical somehow.  Otherwise, everything is pretty OK. I have been spending lots of time with my friends in the past 2 days, remembering that there is more out there than just reading, worrying and being stressed.   And tomorrow its weekend again. Have a bunch of things to take care of before I can go to Justins place, but I sure am looking forward to it.

       Slightly annoyed  I dont like it when people abuse my time. I have lots of studying to do, came to town extra to help Alex with his Icelandic, and we ended up just sitting around with his friends for an hour and a half. Why didnt I say something? Dont know... but I should have.   Now Im going to go buy some food and then Im going to home to continue my studying. Im having a not-so-positive week, but I think food in the fridge, clean clothes and a clean room might help. So, thats what Im gonna do when I get home... as well as studying of course.

       A bit to how Im doing  Sitting here    at the moment, doing my 2 hours of volunteering in the ethnology library, which is in the castle in Tuebingen.   Its about to turn dark outside and in about half an hour I will trottle to university to listen to my extremely british professor ramble on about english grammar. English grammar for 3 hours. It isn't as bad as it sounds. Actually OK, because afterwards I'm going to meet the nordic people and have a glass of wine =)  Tomorrow will be a busy day. Have to take my laptop to the hospital (it's very sick), do some homework for Monday, preferably go to the Second Hand store I found today and then I am going to Justin's place.   I don't have a lecture on Friday so it's going to be a long weekend. Have lots of work to catch up on, and I'm hoping for the best.   Christmas market started here yesterday. It does brighten up ones day, but I still think its a bit early. It's still only the first half of November.   I enjoy : Looking at the pictures taken at student parties at the University of Iceland. I don't know why. It's like an obsession of mine. Of those ppl that I know, most of the girls still look pretty much the same. The guys all weigh 10 kg more. Which makes me look at those pictures and wonder HOW I had such a crush on some of them.   I'm going home in a month and 6 days. Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

       A bit to my last entry.   Before I left for Germany I threw a party. After the party we all went to a university party, where these brilliant pictures were taken.  Apperantly everyone back home has seen them. Except for me. Maybe for a reason because some of them almost made me embarrased. At least it's obvious that we were having fun.

      My last entry seems hostile. I actually wrote a long, nice entry that Monday as well. Somehow it just seems to have disappeared.   Which is a shame because that weekend a week ago was absolutely wonderful. Dinner at an Italian restaurant, massage, redwine, icecream and a Sunday stroll sums that particular weekend up in a few words. Sound great? .. well, it was :)  Last week Justin was here with me. Came on Tuesday and we left together on Friday. It was nice to have him here. I was incredibly stressed for my class on Wednesday (as usual), but it wasn´t as horrible as I had imagined it would be. Maybe because the professor didn´t ask me anything. At least I don´t think I will be so nervous next Wednesday. Nervous of course, but not about to loose my mind from pure stress.   After that class, relaxation came. Justin met me and a friend in town and we had lunch, walked around and enjoyed our afternoon.  I skipped my english grammar lecture and practiced my english instead ... with Justin ... over a cider at the Irish pub =)  Then I dragged him with me to the weekly beermeeting of the nordic people, and those who are studying us. I like those people. It´s always a lot of fun !  Thursday was relaxing, lovely and should be repeated. Breakfast at 3, stroll in town, all-you-can-eat German pancakes and a funny night with Gudrun and Udi at the Jazzkeller playing funny games.   Friday was a bit lost in being tired and sitting on the train.  Saturday even more lost because I was sick. Must have eaten something very bad... at least I was in bed ALL Saturday feeling horrible. Did manage to shower, eat a bit and watch Ice Age and Resevoir Dogs in the evening. Was very lucky not to be alone at home... Don´t think I would have managed being sick like that by myself.   Yesterday we got social. Went to lunch in Steinheim and then visited a friend.  And then I went home.   Had to study this morning.... And now, I have to go because my time is up...

       Snow  I'm hungry. Wondering how that is possible, considering the fact that I haven´t done much but eat in the last few days. Christmas has been nice.  Christmas Eve was wonderful. Good food, good company and lots of good books :)  Yesterday we woke up to go to the annual Christmas party with my dad. I came home with a headache. Every year I come home and wonder why I bothered going. But I go every year. It's just something one does. It's tradition.   Then we came home, ate  hangikjöt , played Trivial Pursuit and watched a movie. An evening with the family. Very enjoyable.  Today we're going to go out for a walk with my dad and their puppy. In the snow. The puppy is the cutest thing ever...little black labrador.  Will be fun for sure

Tedious 18 hours ahead of me. But I just realised that my mom will cook for me tomorrow night and I will sleep in my own bed.

       In less than 48 hours I will be home  And I am extremely happy about that. I am having a day of December depression. Even if things are actually quite OK.  I am just a bit lonely, a bit stressed and a bit worried about the long trip I have to make to get home.   But as stated before - In about 44 hours I will be in Iceland and then, I won't have anything to worry about anymore =)  Sadism... In English I have a so-called  tutorium  (weekly class, tought by a student in a higher semester). The tutor, a very stressed little person, just sent me an E-mail telling me about a mini-term-paper we have to write over Christmas.  I would have known about this already had I not skipped class yesterday. I just couldn't be bothered going. That girl just throws me off with her nervousness. I sit in there and have to concentrate on being nice and not saying anything to her that might make her even more nervous. Seriously, she must have nothing better to do but to torture us. Maybe she needs to feel like she's in control.   My suitcase is already full. And I have only packed the Christmas presents so far. At least it will be half empty when I go back... ahem... or filled with books and stuff from home which I actually find more likely =)  I feel like Santa Claus.    Justin and I met up with Kristin  Volker last Sunday. When they left I just couldn't help crying. I will miss not celebrating Christmas with my sister. This time she is staying here with her husband. My brother is coming home though, which surely is a compensation. I would nevertheless prefer all of us to be in Iceland, together, for once.   I will return tomorrow.  And hopefully I will have some time to update my page.

Dont see what rain and Christmas have incommon. But soon... I'll be home and hopefully it will look more like Christmas there.   Going to Heidenheim later to meet up with Justin. He is working at the moment and I just got up...I can be so lazy sometimes, but quite honestly, there isnt much I have to do anyways.   Positive: LIN (Icelandic Student Loan Fund) doesn't really care about me changing subjects I have successfully finished my Christmas shopping I dont have to take Latin  I might be going to Spain  And... on New Years Eve I am going to a cool party =)

       I have a headache  Probably because I am hungry. I am going to do something about that soon. First though, I have to finish what I came here to do.  It is amazing how productive one can be through the internet. And today I am going to continue to be productive...because I am going to finish my Christmas shopping ! Oh, I just love this time of year...   The concert on Saturday was brilliant. Ok, I am a bit objective here, but I think they are a really cool band. They are recording a CD at the moment, so soon I will be able to share their music with all of you :)  Unbelievable but true, I have already spent my 2 hours here and have to leave. Plus, my stoumache is growling loudly, so I really better go and grab something to eat.

Actually I was supposed to go with Justin to practice this morning, but I just couldn't be bothered getting up.  I had nightmares last night. I woke up very scared... I dreamt some girls from my old class wanted to beat me up. Don't ask... I have no idea why I dreamt something like that.   Well, I have to run now... hope everyone has a good weekend !

       Still sleepy  Officially the alarm-clock woke us up at 7. Now, some 5 hours later, I still feel like I just woke up. It's obviously Monday.   Just came back to Tübingen after a nice weekend. We did quite a bit of studying, but also managed to go out partying on Saturday-night. I went out with 2 guys dancing... it's a rare happening but we had lots of fun. I really needed a night like that, just not to think about anything, drink a couple of beers and dance the whole night through.  Going home that night was breathtaking It was snowing...everything was so quiet  clean. I love snow. I wish it would snow more often around here...  Eventhough we were went out Saturdaynight, we managed to get quite productive yesterday. I worked on my essay and Justin on his project.  It's worrying me a little bit...the fact that I do not seem to be able to write much these days. I just sit in front of the screen and think, get distracted, try to think more and every 2 hours I get insanely irritated with myself because I haven't written anything meaningful yet. I managed 2 pages yesterday. Justin said it sounded good, and I actually think it was OK, but somehow it just strikes me as odd that I, who writes and talks all the time, cannot use the communcation element when I have to. Maybe I just have to have myself fixed ;)  Hard times coming up... finishing the essay, moving, tests and a mid-term paper.  But after that it will be sweet and soft ... I go to Spain, come back and my mom will be here, celebrate easter and go back to university. It will be soooooo sweet.....

       All I want is for the weekend to come...   Stayed up until 2:15 studying last night. I might have been done earlier had I not met up with Gudrun and some other people for an hour and a beer, but after sitting in the library for such a long time yesterday, I needed some relaxation and good company.   Today I have to work on the written report, and finish the minutes. And I also have two hours of a Spanish class, which actually will just be fun. I'm hoping I can catch the last train to see Justin tonight. The amount of work I must do won't get any less, but somehow it's nicer and more relaxing to get a hug once in a while... ;)  You see...now that I have such a wonderful laptop, I can do my work anywhere.

       My new hang-out place  The Brecht-Bau Library. The Brecht-Bau is my building, the building where most languages are tought and where the library for all those languages is. Seeing that I am studying so hard(most of the time at least...), I am spending most of my time in this wonderful library, which (I just found out last week) has lots of computers where you can surf as long as you like.   I haven't been too productive today. It took me about 2 hours to put together one page of the minutes of last English Lit. class. I am in charge of doing them this week together with a guy from my class.  And I am also trying to work on my part of a written report I have to hand in with 2 other girls. It's on multiculturalism in Britain. And I'm suppose to write something intelligent about the literature that this multiculturalism has produced.   As much as I can talk - I feel like I have a permanent writers-block these days.  Won't help me much excusing it though...  I gotta do what I gotta do  ;)  My motivation...   I'm going to Spain in March !!! =)

      Winter sleep ? Not quite. I just haven't gotten close to a good internet connection since I was in Iceland. Believe me. It's hard.   Back in Germany, a bit in the middle of Monday stress, but otherwise doing quite alright. Have a class to go to in 5 mintues and after that I am invited to a birthdayparty. The problem is I don't have a clue how to get to the party. Or back for that matter - but I guess that won't be a problem since Theda, the girl I live with, is going as well.   The weekend was good. Nice and relaxing. With my love... :) We played just a little bit too much of SimCity 3000 (me on my laptop and him on his PC), and I finished my assignment that I meant to finish weeks ago, but fortunatly didn't have to hand in until today.   Lots of things going on. Lots of stress too - but I know that in a month it will all be behind me so it's OK.   Last week was beautiful. Surprising and wonderful. Tati, my little brazilian sister came for a visit. We have been sisters for 7 years :) ...since Jordan ´97 and last met in Brazil 4 years ago. Time passes and we grow, but the sisterhood will never change.   Now I really have to run... hope everyone is well and that I will get a chance soon again to blabber away....

       Happy New Year  As I was lying in bed around 4 O'clock this morning, trying to fall asleep - I finally found a word to describe the year 2003. It was chaotic.  It was an interesting year.Filled with experiences. I have probably grown a bit.   Greatest experiences of last year: Surviving my time as Au-Pair Going to Greenland Starting university  and ... falling in love ;)   In 2004 I hope my existance will stabilise. And I hope for good health for my family And for myself of course.     I'm leaving Monday. Today I have an assignment to finish. I haven't started it. Wish me luck.

       I dont like Mondays  Especially being alone on Mondays. Plus, I just finished spending 48 hours straight with Gudrun. So, its hard trying to be alone again. Now Im going to eat...alone... and then go home... alone.   Im complaining. I know :) Justin is coming tomorrow so then I will stop complaining.. I promise.

       Be happy for me  I passed the Spanish exam. I just barely passed... but I passed, which means I can go into the middle-class next semester.  I'm a happy camper. Not so pleased with the fact that I didn't managed to show the teacher any of my brilliant Spanish knowledge ;) , but I passed and that's actually all that I needed I do to.   I need coffee. Desperately. But yesterday I decided to see if I could live without it. I have a horrid headache, my shoulders and neck hurt, I'm sweating unusally and I just feel off. Very off. But I am not going to give it. I stopped smoking (over a year ago now !!!) and I can live without coffee too. I'm not saying this will be a goodbye - forever to coffee, but I'm trying. Just trying ... Willpower is always an interesting thing. So far I haven't been very good at controlling mine. Especially when it comes to chocolate and coffee.   At Justin's place. Just relaxing. Played SimCity 3000 today. Getting a bit tired of it though. After a weekend of playing it, one figures it out and succeeds every time. That's no fun.   Any cures of caffein-need other than drinking coffee?

       Homesick  I guess it happens to the best of us. Today it's my turn. Woke up feeling sad and it took me a while to realise what the problem was. I somehow don't expect myself to get homesick. Why, all of a sudden? Well... it's drawing closer to my birthday and it'll be the 3rd year in a row that I'm not in Iceland. Vacations are here and I don't know what to do with myself. Gudrún is going home over easter. And I'm homesick. It's a simple as that. How can one not miss it... ?

       In Tubingen  But probably not for long. Going to go see Justin tomorrow again or the next day. I just think I will probably be more productive there than here. It's so easy to be a lazy-bum here. Justin gets up in the morning and because it's not my own place, I don't have much else to do but study. And I really want to start writing my essay so I won't have to be in stress just before I go to Spain on the 14th of March.   I think I will succeed. But today I am still on vacation. Going to the movies with my Gúgú now. Going to see "Mona Lisas Smile". Gotta love chick-flicks.   Ps. Finished reading 101 Reykjavik yesterday. I laughed a couple of times but mostly I just found it quite sickening... It's definetly not my idea of Icelandic reality...

       And the idiot-award goes to...  Today I opened a door into my face. It hurt. A lot. But it was hilarious. Especially because it hit the left side of my face...the door opens to one's right.  Sometimes I wish I had a video-camera following me :)  Er buin ad vera ad velta thvi fyrir mer hvernig ( flest ) islenskt kvenfolk fer ad thvi ad vera svona miklar brussur. I Tubingen er allt fullt af erlendum studentum, serstaklega itolum, frokkum og spanverjum og thaer eru alltaf svo penar og saetar og thegar thaer eru klaufalegar er thad bara kruttlegt. Eg, og okkur, hinsvegar (og eg vona ad mer verdi fyrirgefid thott eg dragi saml?ndur minar i Tubingen inni thetta) tekst ad hella nidur, missa allt i golfid, rekast a hurdir og adra muni og thad er bara ekkert elegant vid thad... Sidur en svo. Eg skil thetta ekki ! Eg vil lika vera svo pen, saet og sjarmerandi ;) I stadinn er eg bara islensk brussa =P  All is well. Justin and I went to a small party last night and I had a very needed (and deserved) beer and some pizza. It was just the evening I needed. Today Justin went to work and I've have been (and still am) enjoying the solitude and the relaxation of not having to do anything. Woke up and went to the library, borrowed some music and then went for a long, long walk around town.  Somehow I've begun to really like this little village. It reminds me of Gardabaer in a way. It's nice and quiet, and people say hello to you on the street. There's a road that goes through town called Lange Stra?e (Long Street) and you can walk from one end to the other in half an hour. There's a farm 5 minutes away from the Town Hall and there's only one bar, open only on Fridays. I think it's wonderful. I don't know if I could ever live in a place like this, but it's a good change from the hectic student-life in Tubingen.   I borrowed a few Icelandic books from the university library yesterday that I plan to read over the weekend. Thad ma buast vid bokagagnryni i naestu viku ;)  Otherwise... it just feels GOOD to be on vacation !

       I'm completamente kaputt  I feel like I got hit in the head with a hammer. In reality, it was just Spanish verbs.  As sad as it may sound, I am not estatic. I'm braindead, exhausted and confused...   I started studying too late last night, went to bed too late, woke up too early and did too bad on the Spanish exam.  Fortunatly it wasn't anything important. Just me trying to skip the first semester of Spanish because I already know some.  I doubt the teacher will realise I know any Spanish. I actually studied hard for the test and I came in there knowing quite a few things. It was just a difficult exam and seeing that I haven't attended any of the classes, I didn't know what to focus on. Yeah, I'm trying to defend myself here...   At least I know now that I'm too old for drinking liters of coke and staying up late studying. It just doesn't work anymore.  I woke up and felt like I had a hangover. And then I had visual problems on my way to university.   But, enough complaining.   I don't have any more tests. I don't have any university until the 19th of April.  And most importantly.. I am GOING TO SPAIN in less than a month ! =)  So, after a bit of sleep, everything is truly good.

       I survived  It was only 45 minutes and I am nevertheless absolutely drained.  I haven't used my brain so much in a long, long time.   It was hard, but different from what I had expected. I had problems with the things I thought I would find easy, and I found the things easy that I thought I would find hard.   And I actually managed to write an essay that made some sense. At least to me.  Let's see what my professor has to say about it.   Now it's time for Spanish. I don't have any words to express how happy I will be these time tomorrow.   Ecstatic? Probably...

       At the library again  Woke up at 8, just to go to university to sign up for a German writing course for foreigners. And of course, it was full before I got to sign up. I can try again on the 15th of April. Which will mean waking up at 6:30 to go there and wait in line because all the new exchange students will be here by now.   Urr... I don't like waiting in line - and I especially don't like it when things don't go my way. I better get used to it though. It seems to be normal when signing up for classes at the university here.   Otherwise I'm fine. It snowed last night, which was nice. It's all melting away now though...   This is where I am...not very attractive at the moment, but I assure you...it's a great place to be =)

       a bit freaked  I am taking an English grammar test on Thursday. Needless to say, I have not studied half as much as I should have... or even a quarter of what I should. On the university site, there is a mock-test where I just tested my knowledge... which isn't at all what I thought it was.   Granted - I am panicking a bit, realising that the test is a day and a half away and I still have some serious studying to do. It's just always the same when it comes to me and English tests. I've always just believed in doing what I can without studying too much...or at all...but now I realise that for this particular test I really, really, really have to study. Maybe I should stop blogging and do that now.  Oh...just realised it's dinner time. Zach and Gúgú (öðru nafni Guðrún Helgadóttir) are gonna be waiting for me outside the mensa [the cantine] in 5 minutes 'cause we're going to have dinner together.   Then I promise I'll come back here and study until I drop.   On Friday afternoon I will be calm again. And then Valentine's Day is on Saturday. Don't really know if we're going to celebrate it in any grand manner, but I suppose I'm at least going to get  my love a card or something... ;)   Around the corner are some more fun days...Fasching (carnival), my birthday, our anniversary and then... of course, my flight to Spain =)   Zach just called and told me that Gúgú is starving. Apperantly they are already waiting for me.  Maybe I should be a good friend and go ...

       Absolutely brilliant  For those who walk past me I probably seem strange.., I am sitting outside the office in Justin's school, with the computer on my lap. Yesterday I realised I could use their wireless connection with my computer. I don't need any passwords or anything, just a seat outside the office where the signal is the strongest.   I would have never thought this school, in a tiny village somewhere in Germany, would get themselves a wireless connection. But incredible things happen... And tomorrow I will probably also have internet in my room. Isn't great? well... I think so :)  I'm doing quite well. Have been studying Spanish all day (ahemm...since we finished breakfast at 2) and I've been making some progress, and just finding all my former knowledge again. It's all there, somewhere in the back of my mind. I just have to fetch it.  Tomorrow will be the end of my semester. I still have my tests, but my last seminar and my last lecture will be tomorrow. The plan for next semester was issued last week and it sounds so interesting. I'm very enthusiastic at the moment...In English it will be a lecture on women's writing, and a seminar on the ethics of reading: rasicm and literature. I hope I will manage to get a space in that seminar. It just sounds so good...   University is great...

       I'm alive.   And without stress this time. Just doing fine. :) I've moved. I have handed in my paper, I have booked my trip to Spain and now all I have to do before I can really start sucking in the beauty of life is to take two tests and write a mid-term paper. And then all will be sweet.   My dorm room is absolutely brilliant. The bed consists of a wide plank, two wooden boxes, and a thin matrasse. My chair is the average, gonna-fall-apart-if-you-move-too-much, chair from  university. The little "bathroom" cupboard above my sink smells like a mixture of all the makeup every girl who ever lived there wore. And that even if I deep cleaned it on Friday. In addition I have a little table I don't know what to do with and an ugly light in the ceiling.   But I love it. Seriously, I love every minute I spend in that room. The view is beautiful, I can hear my neighbours enough to know their alive but not to the point where I get annoyed, and all the furniture is removable, so maybe, eventually, in the distant future, I will have at least gathered myself a nicer bed and a good chair to sit on and study =)  But now my friends are waiting for me to go eat in the cantine. I'm starved so I will leave now.   Guja... takk fyrir að lækna mig af lyftuhræðslunni. Þú hefur ótrúlegan sannfæringarkraft.

       I´m back   Haven´t written anything for a week and I´m sorry - but hey ... at least I´ve been having fun ! The thing is also that the computers here don´t work very well and there´s a lot of people wanting to use them.   But, enough of excuses !... We just came from a café, with our wonderful conversation teacher Roberto. He´s so funny and the 4 other girls in my class are great so we have a lot of fun together. And this week, I have really started to speak Spanish, instead of listening a lot and saying something when I need to, I blabber all the time. Not always correctly, but I´m learning.   I had a conversation class of my own yesterday ! I had to go to the doctor because of my cold. I put on a hat, scarf, gloves and walked to one Centro de Salud (Health Care Center), they sent me to another one, and from that one I got sent to the correct one. I was walking an hour and a half in the rain to find the correct one... I was quite frustrated when I finally got there...but they were nice and I managed to talk to the doctor in Spanish, tell him what was wrong and understand his questions and instructions. So, I got some medicin, went home and slept and today I am much better.  And, I am very proud of myself for having managed to go to the doctor in Spain and only speak Spanish =)   The weekend was fantastic. A bit tiring, but sometimes it´s worth it. Friday there was a big birthdayparty and almost all of the school was there (about 30 people) in a small room in one of the student-apartments. We had an awesome time and this Friday, which will be my last night here, there´s going to be another birthdayparty ! Saturday my friend Rubén, who lives in Madrid, came for a visit. Together we saw all of the sights in Salamanca, almost every church, the university buildings (the university in Salamanca is the oldest in Europe) and lots of other things. 2 days of walking around, talking and sightseeing. We haven´t seen each other since I was in San Sebastian with  urlLink Guja  Brynhildur, and that was only for one night, so there was enought to talk about. Going to see him again on Saturday, because I will spend my last night at his place in Madrid.   Everything is so pretty here, so well restored, clean and wonderful ! Oh, how I wish I could stay longer ! At least I know I will return. No doubt about it!  I´m starting to get this sad feeling of not wanting to leave, but I´m trying not to think too much about it. I know it´s only been 2 weeks, but the school is so great and I´ve been learning so much and having so much fun that it´s hard to leave. Not that I don´t have fun things to return to... but I guess you know what I mean ;)   If you wanna see some pictures, go to  urlLink SALAMANCA FIESTA , click on  Pictures  on the left and then find the pictures from Thursday the 25th (the first one).

       My 3rd and last Monday in Salamanca  How I wish I could stay longer... although I am also looking forward to going  "home",  seeing my mom, my sister and of course Justin :)  I had quite the weekend. On Friday there was a birthday-party and almost all the school was there, about 30 people in one little room ! It was great fun and afterwards we went to Irish Rover to dance. I haven´t had such a night in a very long time ! ... On Saturday my friend Rubén from Madrid came to visit. Basically we saw all of Salamanca, every church, every museum that was open, the university... and of course all of this included lots of walking, all day long both Saturday and Sunday. It was nice because, as I´ve mentioned a couple of times before ;), Salamanca is beautiful. Very beautiful! The only problem is that it has been really cold in the past week and quite windy. It´s still cold, but now it´s raining too ! It was really nice to see Rubén. We were together in a CISV camp in Sweden 1999 and I haven´t seen him since I was in San Sebástian with my wonderful chicas Guja and Brynhildur. Still, it didn´t feel like I hadn´t seen him for a year and a half. That´s the great thing about chatting on the internet... you can keep in touch so easily.  Today it´s like I suddenly speak Spanish. Until now I´ve been listening a lot and been a bit scared of talking because I don´t know so many words and I´m a bit unsure in some of the tenses, but today has been my day in speaking Spanish. I´m so happy about it because if there´s anything that annoyes me, it´s having the feeling that I cannot communicate. I remember my first few months in Germany - I was frequently very frustrated because I didn´t know all the words and couldn´t say what I wanted to say.  And as you can imagine,for me not to be able to talk decently is awful :) But, I managed to learn German, and now the next thing on my list is to learn Spanish as well as I speak German. It might take a while still... but hey... I got time ;)

       So here I am   On a rainy day in Salamance,with a cold. It is not fun. I have a bad cough and my throat hurts -but I´m hoping it´s getting better so I´ll be up and going for the weekend when my friend Rubén from Madrid probably will come visit me. My cold has caused me to be a little bit out of the fun for the past few days, mostly I´ve just been focusing on school and getting better, but I always meet up with the others every night for an hour or two. Yesterday we went to a very dangerous place called Jacko´s where one can buy a litre of sangria or beer for 2 Euros and a litre caiparinha or some other cocktail for 5 Euros. There´s a lot of hung over kids at school this morning. I´m not one of them, because obviously I was a good girl and went home early.   Bara fyrir Hlif: Erum mest á O´Haras, og hittumst audvitad alltaf undir klukkunni a Plaza Mayor. Eg fylgist oft med folkinu ad bida med mer og thad er oft svo fyndid. Stressadar stelpur ad fara a deit og svona. Fekk mer napolitana con nata i fyrradag eftir ad hafa lesid bloggid thitt... mmmmm.... namm !!! fae mer adra i dag, ther til heidurs :)  Anyway...my conversation teacher is back in the classroom so I must go and continue talking about domestic work.

      I´m melting At an internet cafe at this plaza...the Plaza Mayor...   I´ve been sitting outside in 20 degrees and sunshine for the past 2 hours and decided I needed a bit of a break.  The past few days have been fantastic ! Wednesday we had tapas with the teachers from school and then Wednesdaynight we all went to a Saint Patrick´s Day celebration at an Irish pub and then to Medievo, had some sangría and danced into the night. It was great ! Thursday I was a bit tired, but my class  the teachers are so funny that it´s impossible not to have a great day every day! Yesterday was a national holiday in Spain, so we didn´t have any school. I spent the day reading, and sitting at the Plaza Mayor with the others from school. In the evening we of course went out. First to the Irish pub and then to La Biblioteca. Again, lots of fun, but it was good to get into my bed and sleep in this morning ;)  This city is so amazing, always filled with people and things to do. It is without a doubt the most beautiful european city I have every been to. Just imagine living next to something like this...    That´s the cathedral that´s infront of my house. Amazing, isn´t it?

       Wonderful world  Been sitting in a cafe talking for 2 hours with the class. I have talked more Spanish in the past 48 hours than in my entire life... Its very hard, but Im learning and remembering so much and its great fun.  Yesterday I had class until 3, then I went shopping with 2 girls from my school and saw more of the downtown. In the afternoon I had a nap and did my homework, had dinner and then met up with the kids from my school at the Plaza Mayor. Didnt stay out very late though. I want to save my energy for the studying.   Today I changed classes. I had been put into the advanced basic group and I realised already yesterday that all I would do there would be to revise things I know already. So, I am in another group now, will have to study a lot more and revise things for myself, but since I only have 3 weeks, I am going to make the most of it ! Plus, the sun is shining and Salamanca is a beautiful city so I can study outside ;)   The school is great. The teachers are fun and teach really well and one recieves a lot of personal attention. Most of the others are a few years younger than me, but Ive already made some friends and am looking forward to 3 brilliant weeks in Salamanca. Pretty sure I wont actually want to leave again... its just too great here !!!!

       What a strange dream   I dreamt I came into my room and saw that everything except my bed had been taken out.   And, I couldn't find the janitor to get him to give me my stuff back.   Fortunatly, this is not what happens when ones rent is late. They just send you a letter, saying that you have to pay 3 Euros more.   Don't think I'm a slob - the bank transfer between Iceland and Germany takes 2-3 days. Therefore, the first of every month I have money in my Icelandic account that needs to be on the German one on that same day.   It's impossible and Iceland won't put my money directly onto my account here. Unfair isn't it?  So... my rent was late, and I have nightmares about being evacutated out of my nice little place.  Ps. I take back everything I've ever said to anyone about the nice weather in Germany and the beginning of spring.  Tübingen is COVERED in snow !

Despite enormous setbacks, including the fact that most people refuse to  recognize who you are or even that you exist at all, you've built yourself into quite a  productive person. You've got a little trouble maintaining a sense of personal order,  but through the mess, you're still very industrious and have a small but pivotal impact on  almost everyone you know, and even people you don't. You make a whole lot of stuff.    Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the   urlLink Blue Pyramid       You are Victoria of England.  You are not afraid of hard work but still have time for the arts.

       An unfinished essay - Due tomorrow  Don't you just love the stress of an essay deadline? Somehow, no matter how hard I always try, I am always writing my essays at the last minute. Seems like my brain functions the best under pressure. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit. The essay is there. All 8 pages of it. It's just unedited, unfinished and not so brilliant - yet ;)  I was sick all Sunday night. Lay in bed with a horrid stoumache ache and slept about an hour and a half. Turned 360 degrees every 15 minutes to try to find a comfortable position, stood up walked around, tried again and in between I just lay there, feeling sorry for myself. In the morning it got better and I caught about 4 hours of sleep. I was still at Justin's so I went back to Tubingen yesterday afternoon, but didn't touch my essay all evening. My stoumache was still upset, I had a headache and low brain-capacity, so I decided to leave it, collect my energy and be productive today instead.  I was extra nice to myself and went shopping on Amazon =) Bought 12 books for 20 Euros... all of which connect to my studies. It's so nice being a literature student sometimes...

       Joy joy  I passed  the English grammar exam. I didn't really think I wouldn't but... it's always just such a joy to know for sure.  So... now I can go on to the next semester without any problems. You see, without passing this exam, one cannot take many interesting courses. And about 50% of the people that take the exam fail...   My essay writing isn't going as well as I would have wanted it to, but I'm going to try to get my act together today and just  DO IT.   I have too many ideas, too little motivation to form pretty sentances and too little space for all that that I could say.   Now I'm going to go around this library, find some DVD's to please myself with when I've finished the essay, and some music to listen to.   In a week and a day I will be going to Spain. Now that is pure JOY :)

       This is becoming a lazyblogg  And I fully understand if you can't be bothered waiting for my entries any more. I wish I had some excuses. Quite frankly, I have none. Now I have an internet connection at home in Tuebingen and one at Justin's place as well. I'm out of excuses. I'm just lazy.   Last week was wonderful. Justin was in Tuebingen and we did everything and nothing. Relaxed, enjoyed each others company, watched 3 movies (The Bourne Identity, O Brother Where Art Thou and Millers Crossing) and... celebrated my birthday =) Yes.. for those who don't know it, I turned 23 last Friday ! And, for the first time in 3 years, I don't feel older, I´m still "jung und knackig" (young and crispy) and will stay that way until I turn 25. Then it really starts to get scary...   Justin got my internet set up at home so now, when I'm there, I'll be connected 24/7. Which might also mean I'll be home more. We'll see. In the upcoming weeks, there won't be much of that though. Right now I'm Justin's place, writing my term-paper on Doris Lessing's "Debbie and Julie". Quite an interesting story, but not many (read  any ) resources on it to be found anywhere. So I'm just sucking it out of my thumb at the moment. Have been doing fine today, and I hope the week will continue to be so successful. Don't have all the time in the world... supposed to hand it in in a week, but I'll manage. At least I think I will. My perfectionism just makes me stressed sometimes.   Frozen pizza in the fridge, waiting for me to warm it up. Very tasty ... ;) Student food indeed !

       Ég meina það sko   Það er þreytandi að læra. Heilinn á mér á í vandræðum með að vera í notkun amk. 10 tíma á dag. Ég vaknaði í morgun. Klukkan átta. Til að tala við húsvörðinn, ná í pakka sem höfðu komið til mín og kaupa aðgang að þvottavélinni. Og ég fór sjálfviljug í tvo tíma sem ég þarf ekki að mæta í. Verðlaunaði sjálfa mig svo með siestu á milli 2 og 3, mætti fersk í bókmenntatíma, át í mensunni og lærði heima. Það lítur út fyrir að mánudagar þriðjudagar og miðvikudagar verði dálítið strembnir. Sem betur fer er ég ekki í skólanum á fimmtudögum og föstudögum líka ! ;) Ég held ég myndi bara brenna yfir um og engan veginn hafa tíma til að lesa neitt af viti.   Stendur til að lesa Tristram Shandy yfir helgina. Vonandi bara að veðrið haldist svona gott svo ég geti sitið úti og lesið. Búið að vera 15-20 stig og sól hér síðan í seinustu viku. Yndislegt bara. Á að rigna alla næstu viku. Þannig að það er um að gera að njóta þess á meðan á því stendur...   Æi, ég er syfjuð. Hryllingskúrsinn bíður mín í fyrramálið. Er ekki búin að lesa fyrir tímann. Tel það mikilvægara að vera vel útsofin... alltaf mikilvægara að vera vel sofinn :)

      Ritað sl. föstudag   Þeir gusa mest sem grynnst vaða   Ég veit bara ekki hvað ég á að halda. Og hvort ég á að taka þetta til mín eður ei. Þessi speki var semsagt málshátturinn í páskaegginu mínu (eh...okkar...mamma gaf okkur Justin það víst þótt ég væri skiljanlega treg til að deila því með honum). Ég er enn að reyna að skilja af hverju örlögin höguðu því svo að ég fékk þennan málshátt en ekki eitthvað sætt og skemmtilegt.   Á ég að taka þetta til mín?!  Svo var það náttúrulega vandinn að þýða málsháttinn yfir á ensku. Gekk ekki þrautarlaust fyrir sig og endaði með því að ég bjó bara til nýjan málshátt: The smallest dog barks the loudest. Betri tillögur? Ég þarf augljóslega að æfa mig dálítið í þýðingum...   Sniðugheit dagsins: Fæ einn kúrs þetta árið næstum því gefins. Það er nefnilega skylda í norrænum fræðum að taka einn kúrs í forn-íslensku. Forn-íslenska fyrir byrjendur, sem kunna enga íslensku. Ég þarf ekki að mæta í tíma (sem betur fer því þeir eru klukkan 9 á föstudagsmorgnum) og prófið er þýðing úr Gíslasögu sem ég dýrka og dái... og kunni einu sinni spjaldanna á milli. Pínu svindl... en það er ekki mér að kenna að það er ekki gert ráð fyrir Íslendingum í norrænum fræðum :)  Hinn kúrsinn sem ég tek í norrænunni verður hinsvegar töluvert strembinn fyrir mig. Inngangur í bókmenntafræði, sem er ekki slæmt út af fyrir sig, en hann verður á þýsku og ég þarf að halda fyrirlestur sem verður vafalaust eitthvað skrautlegur... Kosturinn er sá að við verðum að lesa danskar bókmenntir sem mér finnst nokkuð spennó.   Er á heildina litið mjög jákvæð gagnvart önninni sem byrjar á mánudaginn. Veit að það verður nóg að gera (er í rúmlega helmingi fleiri tímum en á seinustu önn) en flestir kúrsarnir vekja áhuga minn og þetta verður nú aðeins einfaldara núna þar sem ég er komin pínulítið betur inn í kerfið.

       Sleeping is nice   I've done quite a bit of it today. I woke up early, got everything done and then took the train back to Justin's. Somehow I was absolutely exhausted so I tried to read a bit of Charles Dickens and then successfully fell asleep. I don't know why, but springtime always seems to make me tired, even when I was a kid it did. Not that it matters at the moment. I finished what I had to do in Tübingen and until Monday I am still on vacations. So, I'm going to enjoy this last bit as much as I can.   Today I am formally a student of English Literature. Finally the change of subjects has come through, and I was immensly happy to look at the paper that I got which said:  Neuere Englische Literatur, Fachsemester 2  (New English Literature, 2nd Semester). It made me feel like I'm getting somewhere. Not very far yet, but at least I'm moving ahead ;)    On the subject of literature...    Darling, it seems that you belong in Gone with the Wind; the proper place for a romantic. You belong in a tumultous world of changes and opportunities, where your independence paves the road for your survival. It is trying being both a cynic and a dreamer, no?    urlLink   Which Classic Novel do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Is Gone with the Wind a classical novel?!

       Once again I have changed this site   I realised in Spain that not everyone sees my blog as I see it. So, I have cut out some stuff and put only one menu. For those who are missing a link to their blog, I'm sorry. Maybe I'll add some back when I've decided better how I want this site to look.  I'm home. In Tuebingen. Haven't been here for a month and now that I am, I'm not getting anything done because sitting infront of the computer is so comfortable. I have put up my curtains though... My mom made me long, burgundy curtains that are absolutely gorgeous and make this room look very cosy. Apart from that, they will keep the sun from melting everything in here, and keep the cold out in the winter. Very nice.   But now, I'm getting tired. I still have some unpacking to do, my bed still has to be made and I have to wake up at 7. So, I suppose it's time to say goodnight....

       Almost a week later  But I guess I'm forgiven. I have been too busy enjoying my family's company =) I was in Munich until Saturday. It was wonderful. Sometimes I wish we didn't all live so far away from each other, but when I think about it more carefully I realize that the distance doesn't really matter...at least it hasn't affected my relationship with my mom, but then again we write each other e-mails and sms's all the time.   Saturday Justin came to Munich to  pick me up  but actually more to see my mom and my sister. It made me extremely happy to see all of them together, and to see how much my mom and my sister like him. Obviously it matters to me what they think of him...fortunatly they think he's marvellous just like I do !  The trainride back to Justin's place Saturdaynight was horrifying. Bayern Munchen had been playing a game in Munich that day so all the half-drunk, loud and sweaty football fans were on their way home. On the first train I sat on Justin's lap, in the second we shared a seat and then we almost missed the third train...  We were very happy to come home. And very exhausted.   Sunday we celebrated our second easter together. Of course it involved looking for eastereggs and eating endless amounts of chocolate. We still have mountains of chocolate to work ourselves through, but I don't see that as much of a problem ;)  The last couple of days we have spent in complete and utter relaxation. Right now I am planning the new semester at university, which is starting Monday, and just bought some books over Amazon. I'm going home to Tuebingen tomorrow to get some stuff done, but I suppose I will be back here for the weekend.

      In Munich  What a week ! Been from Salamanca to Madrid to Frankfurt to Stuttgart to Munich...  Sitting in my sisters apartment, happy to be here because she is here, and my mom is here. Happy to be back because I have my Justin back... but I would have loved to stay longer in Salamanca.   It was so hard to leave Salamanca. Fridaynight we had a party and then we all went out dancing at Irish Rover afterwards. I had not thought I would become so sad, but I sobbed my way out of Irish Rover, past the cathedral and into my bed. Saturday I then went to Madrid and spent the night at Ruben´s place before I flew back to Germany. It was nice, but I was tired and missed Salamanca and really just wanted to go home,or back to Salamanca. I guess it didn´t really help that I knew of my mom, my brother and my sister all together in Munich. I would have really liked to be able to clone myself that day .  Sunday I flew back to Germany, and yesterday I came here and I will stay here with my mom until Saturday. She´s flying back to Iceland on Tuesday, but somehow I have a feeling I won´t have to wait so long to see her again ;)  And now... I just want to drink my wine and relax. Maybe watch a movie or some Sex in the City ;)

       My last day in Salamanca  At school, half through the day, feeling quite sad that it´s all over. Not sad to be going back to Germany, but I would love to stay just a little longer. It has been so wonderful. So very wonderful...  Tonight there is a party, so I´m not leaving for Madrid until tomorrow. Tomorrow night I will be going out with Ruben in Madrid ! ... and then Sundaymorning he will drive me to the airport and I will fly to my Justin :) And the best thing is, at this very moment, my supermom is in an airplane, on her way to Germany ! I will see her Monday or Tuesday !.. after 4 months of being without her... it will be a happy moment.   Got lots of pictures yesterday. I am going to find a scanner and publish most of them because they´re great photos. Lots from my birthday and lots from Salamanca. I´ve looked at them 10 times already...  Just got my certificate handed to me... My grade : Excellent =)  If I was to hand a certificate to the school and to Salamanca I would say the same.   It´s been excellent !

      fyrir að ég er að fara í frí á morgun. Legg af stað klukkan 8:15 frá lestarstöðinni til að fara til Bæjaralands þar sem ég og Justin eigum bókað hótelherbergi á þessu hóteli fram á sunnudag.    Sundlaug, sauna, og góður matur. Því miður verða skruddurnar að koma með, en það verður bara dásamlegt að komast aðeins í annað umhverfi og taka því rólega. Sundbolurinn kominn ofan í tösku og ég er að fara að sofa.   Dauðþreytt alveg. Átti rosalegan dag, en nenni því miður ekki að segja ykkur frá því núna.   Verð skemmtilegri eftir helgi. Ég lofa...   Ps. nýjar myndir frá því í dag...

      Miklar breytingar hafa átt sér stað. Ég var búin að fá nóg af drungalegheitunum og ákvað að hleypa grænu-dellunni sem ég er með þessa dagana inn í bloggið mitt.   Og héðan í frá verður þessi síða bara á íslensku. Sú síða sem ég notaði fyrir íslenskuna hingað til verður núna á ensku.   Og ég er þreytt. Vann í fyrirlestrinum mínum um sögu Tübingen til klukkan 3 í gærnótt og í allan morgun. Mér tókst að flytja hann í kvöld, stóráfallalaust og í fyrsta skipti án þess blaðið virðist heftað við nefbroddinn á mér ! Ég var bara með 6 lítil kort með punktum á, og þrátt fyrir ólýsanlegan andlitsroða, stam og smá rugling á kortum, held ég að mér hafi bara gengið vel. Amk. á minn mælikvarða og það er það sem skiptir mestu máli.

       Stress-stuðull : 150 %   Ég er vonlaus í að vera stressuð. Smá stress, svona 25 %, virkar jákvætt á mig en með hverri prósentu eftir það deyfist heilastarfsemin hjá mér, þangað til að ég er utan við mig og algerlega gagnslaus.   Það ætti eiginlega að rannsaka mig þegar ég er í þessu ástandi því ég er orðin það dofin að ég get ekki einu sinni sagt hvað veldur þessu óskapar stressi.  Ég get nefnt hitt og þetta, en ekkert sem fær ykkur virkilega til að vorkenna mér. Þannig að það er líklega bara best að hætta að væla og snúa sér að öðrum málum...  Klukkuna vantar nokkrar mínútur í 12. Ég er að borða kvöldmat, örbylgjaða svínakjötskássu. Ég vaknaði klukkan 8 til að læra og var í skólanum til klukkan 10 í kvöld. Ég er nefnilega búin að komast að því að ég þarf að læra miklu meira. Betra að ég fatta það núna þegar 4 vikur eru liðnar af önninni, heldur en þegar 4 vikur eru eftir.   Helgin mín var yndisleg. Ég er ástfangin af Sviss. Það er hreint þar, ótrúlega fallegt, gott kerfi, töluð 3 tungumál, þar eru vötn, snjór og fjöll... og gott sumarveður. Eftir svona 5 ár getið þið leitað að mér í símaskrá í Sviss. Amk. er á planinu núna að flytja til Sviss þegar ég er komin með BA-ið mitt í vasann. Oh...það væri svo yndislegt !  Skemmtilegast af öllu var þó auðvitað að hitta stóra bróður...hann er bestur í heimi !

Ég er að læra til að fá Magister gráðu, það tekur 4 og hálft ár, 2 ár grunnnám og 2 ár aðalnám, en það er engin prófgráða tekin á milli eins og með BA og Masterinn. Háskólinn hérna er nýbúinn að taka upp BA kerfið aukalega, og ég fór í dag og spurði hvort ég gæti skipt því mér finnst það af mörgum ástæðum meira spennandi kostur. Herrann sagði að ég ætti að klára Magister grunnnámið mitt og svo mætti ég koma til hans og skipta. Án vandræða ;) Ég er svo glöð því ég bjóst alls ekki við að þetta myndi ganga upp.   Ég fæ nýtt batterí í tölvuna mína til mín í næstu viku.  Batteríið mitt er hætt að hlaðast og ég hringdi í þjónustumiðstöðina...einfalt mál, ég fæ bara nýtt með sendiboða. Alltaf skemmtilegt þegar maður fær góða þjónustu.   Ég er að fara til Basel um helgina !  Hef ekki komið til Sviss síðan ég var 17, en núna á ég bróður sem að býr í Basel og hefur boðið mér í heimsókn ;) Það á að vera rosa gott veður og ég hef ekki séð Friðrik síðan um jólin þannig að ég er augljóslega farin að hlakka dálítið til !   Og, síðast en ekki síst:  Ég get loksins farið á fætur á morgnana og notið þess. Ég hlusta núna alltaf á Rás 1 í á morgnana, og finnst það bara YNDISLEGT ! Án efa besta leiðin til að byrja daginn sem ég hef nokkurn tímann haft.

       "My hands are small, I know"   Í dag varð ég meðlimur í Amnesty International.   Eftir fréttir sl. viku fannst mér ekki nema rétt að reyna að veita mannréttindabaráttunni í heiminum smá aðstoð. Þótt ég geti ekki mikið gefið, þá er ég samt að reyna.   Það er hræðilegt hvernig hermenn Bandaríkjanna og Bretlands hafa traðkað á mannréttindum í Írak, myrt og misþyrmt, ... og samt er Bush með 46% fylgi.   Er það bara ég, eða er ekki eitthvað alvarlegt að í veröldinni?

      Bananalýðveldið Ísland  Það svo dæmigert fyrir stjórnarhætti á Íslandi hvernig þrýsta á þessu fjölmiðlafrumvarpi á landann með góðu eða illu.   Heyrði brot úr umræðum Alþingis í gærkvöldi og er hálforðlaus yfir því hvernig þetta fer fram. Spurning hvort íslenska þingið sé til fyrirmyndar í lýðveldisríki... ?!    Er vöknuð, orðin pólítísk og er að fara út í sólina til að fara inn á bókasafn að læra.

       Og...skrifað núna   Justin kom úr vinnunni og fór ekki á hljómsveitaræfingu. Ég tók tölvuna og fór inn á bókasafn, í fyrsta lagi til að hann gæti lagt sig, og í öðru lagi svo ég gæti í þykistunni lært.   Vá hvað ég er ekki í stuði til að skrifa ritgerð. Eins og mér finnst í rauninni gaman að skrifa ritgerðir, þá fresta ég því alltaf út í hið óendanlega. Það virðist samt virka. Einhvern veginn. En samt ... ég ætti kannski að venja mig á betri siði.   Það er kanína í ískápnum. Kvöldmaturinn... ahemm... þótt mér finnist fátt betra en góð steik - þá get ég bara ekki hugsað mér að borða svona lítið héraskinn...   Urr - smá orka óskast. Bara smá... verð að skrifa ritgerð. Og hætta að kvarta :)

      Skrifað um hádegið   Bara einn af þessum laugardögum  Komin í brúnu buxurnar, Justin ekki heima í allan dag og nokkuð augljóst að ég er að fara að læra. Mikið. Þarf að skrifa ritgerð fyrir mánudaginn, auk þess að lesa bók eftir Karen Blixen, komast (helst) í gegnum helminginn af David Copperfield og læra heima fyrir spænsku.    Ritgerðarefnið mitt er frekar heimskulegt. "Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus. How vast is the gulf between the sexes?" Ég er í ritsmíðatíma á ensku og við fengum 4 ritgerðarefni til að velja úr, hvert öðru vitlausara. Ég valdi þetta af þeirri einföldu ástæðu að þetta endalausa blaður um hvað kynin séu ólík fer í taugarnar á mér. Í raun og veru erum við nefnilega bara spendýr, þurfum að nærast og fjölga okkur. Kannski dálítið háþróuð spendýr með hátt sjálfálit - en engu að síður...   Við fórum á tónleika í gærkvöldi. Það var allt í lagi, en ég var í fúlu skapi allan gærdaginn, stressuð og leiðinleg, og nennti eiginlega ekki að djamma - en nennti heldur ekki að vera ein heima. Mér finnst sko ekkert skemmtilegt að vera í fúlu skapi. Mér leið bara eins og ég væri með múrsteina í maganum, allt fór í taugarnar á mér og ekkert virtist geta kætt mig við. En dagurinn í dag er betri. Kannski af því að ég er bara ein og þarf ekki að tala við neinn fyrr en einhvern tímann í kvöld.

       Ég hef ekki tíma   En ég ætla samt að blogga smá bara svo að þið haldið ekki að ég sé orðin letibloggari.  Ég hef nefnilega bara svo mikið að gera og er búin að vera í hálfgerðu stressi þessa vikuna - sem virðist bara vera að aukast því það er mikið að gera um helgina í lærdómi og félagslífi. Ef ég hefði lært eitthvað um seinustu helgi væri ég kannski ekki svona stressuð, en það var bara of gaman og ekki alveg stemmning til að vera að draga upp skruddurnar.   Við dönsuðum okkur í gegnum laugardagskvöldið, sýndum listir okkar í latínódönsum og skemmtum okkur konunglega. Á sunnudaginn grilluðum við svo upp í sveit ;) Það er stundum einstaklega gaman að vera til !!!  Annað nýtt - ég svaf loksins vel í nótt ! Fékk þá snilldarhugmynd að setja pullurnar mínar 3 undir rúmdýnuna hjá mér og viti menn, loksins er ég komin með sæmilega þægilegt rúm sem mér líður vel í. Svo fékk ég pakka að heiman sem er alltaf yndislegt, jafnvel þótt að innihaldið séu gamlir sandalar og gamall jakki... og smá sending frá mömmu sætu. Það er bara þessi tilfinning að vita að þessi pakki og þetta dót var heima í höndunum á mömmu fyrir nokkrum dögum. humm... skæl... ;)  Jæja, ég þarf að fara að drífa mig að pakka og fara í bæinn að stússast svo ég geti náð lestinni klukkan 17:06.   Nýjasta nýtt í mínu lífi : eBay og að hlaða niður bíómyndum  Sex and the City á Kazaa. Afar sniðugt.

      Sl. mánudag skrifaði ég snilldarfærslu sem heimurinn mun því miður aldrei fá að sjá því netið mitt ákvað að virka ekki þegar ég ýtti á  send  og þar með var færslan horfin. Ég var augljóslega svo spæld að ég gafst bara upp á bloggskrifum um sinn, jafnvel þótt ég hafi látið lítið í mér heyra sl. viku.   Ég á að vera að læra heima en letin er öllu yfirsterkari. Eldmóðurinn er týndur þessa vikuna, mig langar helst að vera bara heima að sofa eða lesa bók. Nenni engan veginn í tíma eða að læra heima, en ég býst við að hitinn sem hér er hafi mikið með þessa leti að gera. Það er hægara sagt en gert að læra í 25 stigum, raka og glampandi sól. Já, annirnar eru kjánalegar hérna, en á heildina litið er samt betra að þurfa að lifa af sumarveður í nokkra mánuði heldur en rokið og rigninguna heima mestallt árið... ;)  Eftir þrjár klukkutíma verð ég svo komin í helgarfrí aftur. Ég kvarta og kvarta og gleymi svo hvað vikan mín er fljót að líða. Verð samt að vera obboslega dugleg við að lesa fyrir prófið mitt 23.júlí. Merkileg þessi munnlegu próf. Maður les og les og les, vitandi að prófið verður bara 20 mínútur og að það er ekki nema brot af því sem maður las sem kemur á prófinu. Hef eiginlega aldrei farið í svona munnlegt próf. Í MR vissi maður hvað maður átti að læra fyrir munnlegu prófin og gat líka gert sér í hugarlund hvernig spurningarnar verða. Ég hef ekki hugmynd um hvað prófessorinn mun spyrja, en vonandi á ég þá eftir að vita nóg til að geta svarað honum. Það hjálpar mér töluvert að geta amk. talað almennilega ensku og þurfa ekki að vera stressuð yfir því.   Hefur íslenskunni minni hrakað? Ég var að lesa yfir þessa færslu og finnst orðaröðin í sumum setningunum dálítið einkennileg, en get samt ekki gert betur. Finnst ég samt tala miklu betri íslensku núna en ég gerði fyrir ári, sem er kannski ekki skrýtið þar sem ég er núna með mjög mikið síblaðrandi íslendingi sem heldur mér við efnið.   Talandi um Guðrúnu, þá er hún búin að setja inn FULLT af myndum á síðuna sína. Þar má sjá mig, okkur og fullt af öðru skemmtilegu fólki. Kíkið á  urlLink þetta  !

Ég er það ekki.. ætti ég að segja honum það? eða halda því leyndu.. ég er svo hrædd um að hann hætti við mig.. hann er sko ættaður frá Pakistan.

      ...sofa út  ...fara í langa sturtu  ...hlusta á Rúv á morgnana  Er í skólanum og ætti að vera að læra. Er bara eitthvað utan við mig í dag - líklegast vegna þess að í fyrsta skipti í sirka 2 vikur svaf ég reglulega vel. Ég vaknaði í sjokki í morgun, viss um að ég væri búin að sofa yfir mig því mér datt ekki í hug að ég gæti verið að vakna á undan vekjaraklukkunni ;)  Ég átti dásamlega helgi, bara allt voða rólegt og chillað, las eina bók, skrifaði eina ritgerð, horfði í 101 Reykjavík á þýsku (eyddi mestallri myndinni í að benda Justin á mikilvæga hluti (ráðhúsið, mjólkurfernurnar, Snæfellsnes, Laugarveginn...), talaði töluvert í símann og lék mér aðeins í tölvunni. Bara gott mál.   Er kannski næstum búin að fá áhugaverða sumarvinnu :) Vona hið besta...  Ég er hérmeð hætt að tilkynna nýjar myndir. Ég set hvort sem er inn myndir amk. tvisvar í viku og þeir sem hafa áhuga geta bara gáð.  Annars væri líka dálítið skemmtilegt ef fólk myndi nota kommentakerfið. Mér finnst ég bara vera að skrifa fyrir sjálfa mig þessa dagana, en kannski er ég bara orðin svona leiðinleg...

      var 17.júní og upp á það var haldið með grillveislu hjá Guðrúnu. Það var alveg ofsalega gaman, borðaður harðfiskur og flatkökur, hlustað á Botnleðju, rímur og Bubba, gerð tilraun til að syngja þjóðsöngin, grillað, dansað og ... teknar  urlLink myndir  =)  Þetta var einstaklega sniðugt kvöld.

      Kvensjúkdómalæknir með viti óskast í grennd við Tuebingen.   Þetta er nú orðin löng og sorgleg saga, þessi leit mín. Það er nefnilega hægara sagt en gert að koma sér upp glænýju "læknasafni" í öðru landi og það hefur nú gengið upp og ofan hjá mér. Sigur seinustu viku var að ég fann mér heimilislækni. Sigur morgundagsins verður vonandi að ég sé búin að finna mér tannlækni. Ósigur dagsins í dag var hinsvegar fundur minn eina stórskrýtna frú kvensjúkdómalækni.  Ég vaknaði snemma til að vera mætt stundvíslega klukkan níu. Sleppti meira að segja að borða morgunmat til að vera ekki of sein. Leist mjög vel á þetta þangað til að ég hafði sagt lækninum það sem hún vildi vita. Þá spurði hún mig hvort ég væri orðin 'pilluþreytt'. Ég neitaði því en hún virðist ekki hafa meðtekið svarið því á því andartaki byrjaði hún langa og stranga ræðu um getnaðarvarnir, þó aðallega pilluna. Hún teiknaði heilan helling fyrir mig, lífskúrvu kvenmanns, tíðarhringinn, frjóvgun eggs (mér fannst ég svolítið vera komin aftur í líffræðitíma í 7.bekk) og útskýrði svo fyrir mér tengsl tíðarhringsins við himinn og jörð, sagði mér að ég væri að fara gegn þróuninni og myndi aldrei læra neitt á meðan ég væri á pillunni og margt annað sem mér fannst svo absúrd að ég ætla mér ekki að tíunda það hér. Undir þessari ræðu sat ég í klukkutíma, kom út með blað um hina svokölluðu tíðarhringsaðferð og afar ringlaðan haus.  Og ég sem vildi bara fá recept fyrir pillunni....  Þar sem ég var að segja Guðrúnu þessa sögu áðan og sýna henni teikningu læknisins, kom til mín ítölsk stelpa og spurði hvort ég hefði verið hjá kvensó. Hún hafði lent í því sama hjá sama lækni. Henni hinsvegar tókst að fá recept fyrir pillunni...

      Mér finnst ekkert gaman að vakna. Alls ekkert gaman. Og í dag var það hreinlega bara sársaukafullt því mig langaði SVO að halda áfram að kúra í hlýja rúminu mínu en ég er að fara til læknis klukkan 9 og þurfti því að rífa mig á fætur.  Aumingja ég... mig langar SVO að sofa út...

      Átti yndislega helgi með mömmu í sætu sætu borginni minni. Gengum um, borðuðum góðan mat, sátum í sólinni og svo...þurfti ég líka smá að læra.   Hélt fyrirlestur um Ísland rétt áðan og gekk bara rosa vel. Gaman að halda fyrirlestur og vita allt um allt og þurfa ekkert að undirbúa sig... svolítið "the easy way out" úr þessum enskutíma mínum, en þar sem við þurfum að halda einstaklingsfyrirlestur um hvað sem er, fannst mér nú bara rökrétt (og einstaklega einfalt) að tala um Ísland sem er auðvitað  bezt í heimi  :) Harðfiskurinn féll nú ekki alveg í kramið hjá blessuðum þjóðverjunum en þá er bara meira eftir handa mér ! mmmm... namm...   Myndir frá helginni komnar !

      Þessi miðvikudagur: tæplega 30 stiga hiti, tilraun til að læra undir próf, hlaup á milli lækna og bið á biðstofum, próf, ísát og langur eftirmiðdagsblundur.   Mjög langur eftirmiðdagssblundur sem hófst klukkan 7 og lauk klukkan 10. Held raunar að ég fari bráðum að sofa aftur. Ég þarf að vísu að taka til hérna áður en að mamma kemur, en ég er bara alveg gjörsamlega búin að vera einhvern veginn.

      Þriggja rétta máltíð - Brezel í forrétt, banani í aðalrétt og súkkulaði í eftirrétt. Skolað ljúflega niður með grænu sítrónutei. Hljómar eiginlega bara ágætlega.   Svo ætla ég að fara að sofa. Tvöfaldur þvottur bíður mín klukkan sjö í fyrramálið, svo ekki sé minnst á lærdóm fyrir prófið í forn-ensku sem ég er að fara í á miðvikudaginn.   Maður skyldi ekki halda að það byggju stúdentar hérna. Það eru endalaus læti í þessu liði. Friður á mínum gangi sem stendur, en virðist vera partý á hæðinni. Er hætt að láta þetta trufla mig. Ég vildi þetta sjálf. Auk þess er ég nú vanalega ekki hérna nema helming vikunnar, og þá tæplega nema til þess að sofa og fara á netið. Kannski ekki nema skrýtið að mér finnist ég ekki ennþá vera nema rétt flutt inn.   Það ætti að banna Ebay... Ég hef ekki keypt neitt merkilegt nema digivélina, en það er svo gaman að skoða sig um.

      Ritgerðin búin og komin á diskling, ég búin að pakka niður í tösku og setja sólgleraugun á hausinn og nú á ég bara eftir að stökkva út og ná í strætó.   Keypti í matinn í morgunn og fór svo inn í eldhús til að smyrja mér brauðsneið rétt áðan. Hefði betur látið það ógert. Þar sat erkifíflið sem býr hérna inn á ganginum, ber að ofan á stuttbuxum (og ekki sérlega kræsilegur) og kjaftaði lítinn ameríkana sem var að reyna að elda hádegismat í kaf. Það skal tekið fram að ég hef rifist heiftarlega við þennan unga króata og það andar töluvert köldu á milli okkar. Hann sýndi sínar bestu hliðar á meðan ég var þarna, lifti upp rasskinninni til að reka við, kvartaði yfir því hvað ég sæist sjaldan og blaðraði einhver ósköp um ekki neitt. Urr. Sem betur fer er ég í of góðu skapi til að láta þetta fara mikið í taugarnar á mér.  Semsagt, 20 stiga hiti og ég á leið í tíma...

      Loksins komin heim til mín. Póstkassinn var úttroðinn, pakki fyrir utan dyrnar og þungt loft beið mín innan dyra. Sem betur fer ekkert lífvænlegt í ísskápnum ;)  Einhvern veginn gott að vera komin heim. Það er útaf fyrir sig ekkert slæmt að búa í ferðatösku, en ég hafði jú bara pakkað niður fyrir 5 daga... Á tvöfalt stefnumót við þvottavélina á þriðjudaginn klukkan 7. Væri gott að muna að kaupa þvottaefni í þetta skiptið.  Stutt helgi hjá Justin - kom á föstudagskvöld og fór aftur í dag. Sé hann svo ekki aftur fyrr en 17. júní. Finnst dálítið langt þangað til, en mamma er að koma á fimmtudaginn og verður hjá mér í tæpa viku þannig að ég ætla nú ekkert að kvarta.   Er frekar andlaus þessa stundina. Held ég skutli inn myndunum frá hvítasunnunni og andleysist svo yfir ritgerðinni sem ég á að skila eftir 23 tíma. Alltaf gaman.

      Mér gekk einstaklega vel á munnlega prófinu mínu.   100 sinnum betur en ég hefði þorað að vona... og 200 sinnum betur en að ég hélt að mér hefði gengið þegar ég kom út (ég fékk niðurstöðurnar 5 mín. seinna)...  Prófessorarnir sögðu að ég vissi voða mikið, að ég talaði næstum lýtalausa ensku og hefði ekki haft neina ástæðu til að vera svona stressuð !  Og ég sem var að taka prófið ári á undan öllum hinum. Mikil gleði...og nóg ástæða til að fagna  ;)

      Ég vaknaði við óbærilegan hávaða í nótt og var í nokkrar sekúndur fullviss um að það væri kominn heimsendir. Ég man meira segja eftir því að hafa velt því fyrir mér af hverju það væri kominn heimsendir núna en var annars alveg pollróleg yfir þessu. Ef heimurinn er að líða undir lok getur maður hvort sem er ekki mikið gert...  Fattaði svo að þetta voru þrumur. Og svona líka háværar þrumur... Ég er augljóslega ekki vön þessu sumarveðri, brjáluðum hita á daginn og þrumuveðri á nóttunni. Held í staðinn að mín hinsta stund væri upprunnin :)  Stóra prófið á morgun. Gæti farið að gráta úr stressi en læt það eiga sig í þetta sinn. Kannski gengur þetta, kannski ekki. Ef ekki, þá tek ég bara prófið aftur næsta haust. Velti því fyrir mér í gær að hætta við, en svo hugsaði ég að ég væri búin að eyða alltof löngum tíma í undirbúning til að droppa þessu bara daginn fyrir próf - og þar að auki er meiri aulaskapur að hætta við en að falla. Það stendur annars ekki til að falla. Ég er búin að lesa allt vel í gegn og hef staðið mig vel í tímum. Ég er bara aðeins að fara á taugum.   Á morgun kemur svo Justin og verður hjá mér yfir helgina. Eins og stendur komumst við ekki bæði hérna inn... en smá tiltekt hlýtur að laga það. Eftir viku kem ég heim. Vildi hálf óska að ég hefði meiri tíma hérna til að vera í fríi og njóta mín, en það er ekkert annað í boði en að fara heim og byrja að vinna eftir verslunarmannahelgina. Ekki það að ég eigi ekki eftir að njóta mín heima ... ;)

      það játast hér með að ég hlakka til að koma heim. Aðallega því þá fæ ég að sjá fullt af fólki sem mér þykir vænt um, og ég fæ að borða bland í poka og góðan mömmumat.   Hinsvegar get ég ekki ímyndað mér hvernig mér liði ef ég væri að flytja heim. Það er svo lifandis skelfingar ósköp gaman að búa hérna og ég veit hreint út sagt ekki hvað þyrfti að ganga á til að ég flytti heim! Kannski finnst einhverjum þetta sorgleg lesning, en mér finnst bara miklu betra að vera hérna en heima. Ísland er og verður alltaf bezt í heimi en...  "Gvöð, hvað mig langar ekki að búa þar" ( urlLink Guðrún  að tjá sig í gær)

      Átti frábæra helgi. Lærði ekki sérlega mikið, en naut þess hinsvegar til hins ítrasta að vera til. Stundum verður maður líka að kunna að forgangsraða jákvæðu hlutunum :) Það voru nefnilega útgáfutónleikar hjá  urlLink hljómsveitinni  hans Justins á laugardagskvöldið. Hvílíkir  urlLink snilldartónleikar  ! Svo var djammað til kl.5. Mjög gott og stundum bara very needed...

      í bili. Ég veit ekki hvað ég á að gera. Það varð þvílíkur misskilningur og það er ekkert internet þangað sem ég er að flytja. Ég meika það ekki. Eftir að hafa verið súpersnilldartengingu hérna í hálft ár, sé ég ekki fram að lifa án þess. Ég er föst í dáldið djúpum skít. Ég veit ekki hvort þetta reddast allt, en ég get víst lítið gert í því fyrr en á morgun. Æ, æ....

      því ég er að flytja eftir 9 daga. Bækurnar mína komnar í kassa og það sér ekki högg á vatni í herberginu mínu. Á kannski aðeins meira dót en ég sagði við nýja leigusalann minn í gær... þarf nefnilega að geyma dótið mitt þar í viku áður en ég fer formlega að borga leigu 1sta ágúst. Á eiginlega eftir að sakna herbergisins mín hérna því ég var búin að koma mér svo vel fyrir en hitt er nú ekki mikið öðruvísi,pínulítið með rúmi, borði og stól og hillum.   Æi, þetta er allt pínulítið skrýtið og gerist SVO hratt en ég vona að þetta gangi vel og að ég hafi tekið rétta ákvörðun. Er að vísu eki ennþá búin að skrifa undir leigusamninginn þannig að þetta er ekki 100% ennþá. Ekki alveg en næstum því.

      Í dag helltist yfir mig ógeð á bloggum. Mínu eigin sem og flestum öðrum bloggum. Það eru allir að blogga en í raun hefur fólk mest lítið að segja. Velti því stundum fyrir mér hver sé eiginlega tilgangurinn, t.d. með því að telja upp hvað maður hefur gert um daginn þegar það eru hvort sem er vinir manns sem lesa bloggið og þeir ættu jú að vita hvað maður er að bardúsa.   Kannski öðruvísi með mig þar sem ég bý í útlöndum og hef eiginlega bara stöðugt samband við 2 manneskjur heima, en ég er sjálf afar sek um að telja upp atburði dagsins, eða vikunnar, og hafa svo ekkert meira að segja.  Það má ekki skiljast sem svo að ég hugsi ekki, held það sé frekar að ég er einhvern veginn orðin dálítið heftur bloggari í seinni tíð, þori ekki að vera alveg hreinskilin.  Það hefur líka margt breyst síðan fyrir tæpum 2 árum þegar ég byrjaði á þessu. Þá var ég jú Au-Pair hjá oft ansi athyglisverður fólki, var á lausu og hafði nógan tíma til að vera að einhverju sprelli. Núna, tja, ég ætla ekki að segja að það gerist aldrei neitt, síður en svo, en hlutirnir eru í fastari skorðum og svo... er ég dálítið yfirborðskennd stundum.   Þetta skal ekki lesið sem minningargrein um bloggið mitt. Ég játa að það er bloggþreyta í mér (ætli ég hafi smitast af  urlLink Guju ?) en ég hef tíma til að jafna mig á henni því Dúlla er að fara á heilsuhæli í Englandi fram í næstu viku. Fyrir þá sem ekki vita hver Dúlla er þá er það fartölvan mín, sambýlingurinn sem gerir mér kleift að blogga, kaupa föt og bækur, læra, hlusta á tónlist, horfa á fréttirnar og DVD og ýmislegt fleira. Ómissandi alveg. Hún er pínu lasin og verður sótt á morgun. Snúff. Vona amk. að hún komi heil til baka fyrst ég fæ ekki að fylgja henni...

      að ég gleymdi að skrúfa almennilega fyrir vatnsflöskuna mína áður en ég setti hana ofan í skólatösku. Ég hef svo oft hugsað um þennan möguleika þar sem ég skrifa með blekpenna en greinilega ekki nógu mikið því áðan fylltist taskan mín af vatni með þeim afleiðingum að amk. 20% af forn-ensku þýðingunum mínum þurrkaðist út. Ég er ekki búin að ná að meta skaðann ennþá, enda bækurnar hráblautar og ég svo súr að ég fór bara á netið til að reyna að róa mig áður en ég fer að læra. Urr...   Annars lauk hinu ljúfa lífi með bjór á Marktplatz í gærkvöldi. Þangað til 23.júlí verð ég að vera agalega dugleg að læra og löt að gera allt sem mér þykir skemmtilegt. Ekki það að það sé leiðinlegt að læra, eiginlega er það bara fínt þegar maður er búin að koma sér í gang, en ég hefði samt einhvern veginn viljað geta notið sumarsins hérna pínulítið lengur en í tæpa viku áður en ég fer heim til Íslands.   Ég hitti 8 sæta Íslendinga um helgina. Það var alveg rosalega góð lykt af þeim, þeir brokkuðu til mín og hneggjuðu af ánægju ;) Við Justin fórum í heimsókn til vinafólks okkar sem á nokkra íslenska hesta sl. helgi, og eyddum 2 tímum í að knúsa og kjassa þessi hross, sem eru þau allvinalegustu íslensku hross sem ég hef kynnst. Fórum ekkert á bak, en það stendur til með haustinu þegar ég kem aftur og við höfum meiri tíma.   Gleðifrétt vikunnar: Justin er orðin skegglaus. Hann var búin að vera með alskegg síðan í lok mars og á sunnudaginn var hann búin að fá nóg. Ég líka. Fyrir löngu! Mér fannst ég hafa eignast nýjan kærasta þegar hann var loksins búin að raka allt af. Mikil gleði. Mjög mikil gleði ;)
