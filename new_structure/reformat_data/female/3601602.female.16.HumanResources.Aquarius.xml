      Not really.  But my first exam is in three days so i kinda need to study.  But instead i'm writing in my blog.  Aren't i smart...... But aren't there like millions of studies that say if you indulge in creative things like music or writing (tee hee) you do better on things like science and math both of which i have an exam on in the next week.  Hopefully i'll do okay.  And i know everyone tells me i'll do fine, but i have frozen before on tests and i don't want that to happen this week.  Especially on french history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

      Guess why?  Because my b-day is on groundhog day!! Therefore it is automatically cool. To me, anyway.  Guess what!!! My french history project is done, done, done!!!!! Hurray and yippy! Is that how you spell yippy? But there's only  one  week of studying until exams which will be super hard because we have to know a bazillion diagrams and charts and laws and procedures and all that other crap that i will only want to remember if i'm arrested or something. so i guess i should go study or something... maybe Canadian Idol is on.....

      I learned this last night when I went to see I, Robot. It was waaaaay better than I thought it would be. I'm not usually the sci-fi kinda girl, even though my two brothers totally are, but I really enjoyed it. Except for all the freakin' product placements!!!! Geez, they mentioned Converse All-Stars like 5 times in the first ten minutes of the movie. It was horrible.  Anyway, a robot asks Will Smith what it means when you wink because he saw Will Smith wink at Chi McBride, who plays his lieutenant. And Will Smith's character says it is a sign of trust, "something robots wouldn't understand". Will Smith's character has a prejudice of robots. But I won't tell you why because I don't want to spoil the movie for you when you go see itwhich you really should.  You know, all these years, I've been thinking winking was a come-on or something. Silly me. So now, when people think I'm coming on to them, and they're not into it, I can say it's really a sign of trust between us. Foolproof flirting! Sweet!

      That sentence sounds so much more exciting than reality. Too bad. My band is actually the youth band at my church, made up of five people. Or six, if you count my dad, who's our band instructor, but who's been playing his guitar with us since it started up in May. He's said since the first that he'd only play with us until we sounded more "together". After all, we have two capable guitarists. And M. and S. sound better then ever. But my dad's still playing with us. Why??? Also, some of the things he does are really annoying. Like, telling us to be quiet, which he does in a way that's fine for elementary school kids, but is soo condescending for five teenagers. And how he turns up his guitar amp way loud, then tells M. and S. to turn theirs down so we sound more "balanced". I know it's not his fault he's hard of hearing (practically deaf) but he should consider the people listening to us. They won't be able to hear M. and S. just like I can't, when I'm sitting right near them.  Sigh. I love my dad, I really do, and usually we get along really well, but sometimes I need to unload. This is a good way to do it. Yay for blogs!!!

      Blah blah blah....I can't think of anything to say.  My brain is ooooooozing out my ears and I'm becoming a puddle on the floor. Ugh.

      I have to go to work in 45 minutes so I just thought I'd write a quick message about how much this sucks!  It's Canada Day and I'm on dishwashing. Instead of watching fireworks I will be smelling lobster for five hours.  And instead of going to see a concert tomorrow like I was gonna, I have to work again.  Man, if they weren't paying me for this, I don't think I'd go at all.
