       Oh...... Look, its Mid Fucking year evaluation time. that's right! ...The goddamned Monkey on your back is ready to give you the 411 on what he/ she ( I prefer Horses Ass) considers your net worth to the Company.  How pathetic!.... shiiiiiiiiit .... Let me just roll the clock back ... To 10:30 am July 21, 2004. Place: some where in the corporate world of Commercial Services . Who: a small fatMotherFucker ... (tothose who dare speak of it ...aka my boss) sits adjacent to me watchingEighthours of damn golf while interceptinginbound sales calls and munching on MYDAMN PRETZELS( hope the spit tastes good to yah bro !)His Pastime: talking cash shit with his fucking home boy and BAP. How Great........Mrs ... BAP or as I like to call her ..Magoo( Bitch can't see without her coke bottle glasses or astigmatism contacts... Constantly whines his name about 30 or more times a day Daaaaaaaannnnny!.....Fucking Great ... What a goddamned circus. Now I am told I have a mid year revue ....I feel my temper rising as he gleefully takes magoo back and she emerges all smiles .... ( keep in mind all week this mother fucker quoted good things come to good people ... (do they have a saying for evil doers like me. I wonder?)Well now its my turn ... I fucking sitting there and he points a stubby crooked finger at my quota numbers ... Speaking very quickly and sharply .. Stating this is what counted the most. Then he stated some more bull shit as he flips over the page. I couldn't believe ME  fucking eyes...... !!!!   The Truth be known I swear I sprouted horns and a goddamned tail .... As my words soared out now in reverse: kcuf eht tahw for those who are of a holy background that is what the fuck ... I Couldn't believe what I was reading .. Me .. A fucking training mogul, damn doormat for all,.. Was now reading that I wasn't capable of communicating with others ....... Yes ... Others ...(I guess those Account Execs...That I trained and Telesales Reps oh and don't let me forget the Managers referred to me for training ooooh ... And even my horses ass of a boss comes to me to answer questions don't count. My eyes ... Now slits .... Read feverishly on .... NOT A TEAM PLAYER, CAN'T GET ALONG WITH OTHERS,as this Son of A Bitch mockingly whispers ... Look at me not at that paper. Well,I knowat that moment .. Fire flew from ass and propelled me forward in the hard uncomfortable piece of shit called a chair.....And Iexpressed myheatedopinion and let me tell ya it was hot in there... I bet peoplewalking by werescorchedand could possilbystill be rolling around trying to put out the flames. I stated I would not sign off on that piece of shit for all the fucking money in the world..( however I could be persuaded if it included a group of small spider monkeys shooting from his ass ).I was so fucking pissed I took the rest of the damn day off drank goddamned rum and ... Took a long goddamned shower ... (to wash the bull shit off ).....People the Workaholic is in and taking fucking names .... grrrrrrrrrr!
