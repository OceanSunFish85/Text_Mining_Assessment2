       Hey everyone! As you can see from my title..YESI'm up to something! Not into trouble though. I just realised it this morning while listening to Avril Lavigne's "My happy ending". Umm.. I don't know, it's like all of a sudden I felt so sad. I was writing an e-mail to one of my friendsin the Philippines.I realised that "why do we have to leave?". I mean,we were perfectly stabled and happy but forsomereason someonehas to take it away from us!That song('My happy ending'),it didn't meanto me aslove song, but more of a memories song. I don't know, it'sodd. I mean the song is meant to beas love song then a memories song. *sigh*, it's really weird. It's hardto explain. I know what I'm feeling, but to explain it to someone is hard. I'm just really homesick right now! And is school is about to start in a month(first year in hs!). ARGH! This is really annoying, I want to say it but I can't. I can't put in words. Right at this moment, I'm fucking teary eyed. Argh! Why do I have to feel this again! I thought I'm over it! I WANNA GO HOME! I DON'T BELONG IN THIS PLACE! And the sad thing about this, the only person I can talk to about this is my sister. I don't have any friends.Well atleast here.I can't talk to my dad eitherbecause he has too much things going on in his mind and I don't want him to worry. Well that's about it. Thanks for caring, and take care!

       Hello everyone! It'saThursday(duh!)and it's really sunny and warm. It feels sooo good. I love the summer.You're out of school,you get to be lazy,it's sunny,warm, and did I mention no school?!? Hehe. Hmm.. but usually, my summers are really, really boring. I have nothingto do thanto stayhome, watch t.v., eat,and basically go online. But unless, it's my sisters day off (i have 2 elder sisters). We always go out whenever its their day-off. We go to downtown, lake, hangout with their friends, watch a movie, it's fun. Well, nothing really has happened to me yet though, it's too early. Well actually, something will happen and I'll just go write it down.... Well you see, my sister's friends arecoming today at our house. She said that they're staying for the WHOLE day,WHOLE day! Holy shit! I have no problem with her friends,it's just that, I don't know, I just don't like people coming to our house. You know why? Because I always end up cleaning up the mess and cleaning before the visitors come. IT'S SOOO ANNOYING! I don't mean to be whinning, but IT ISREALLY ANNOYING! Oh heck, whatever. I don't know, I just feelthat it's unfair on my side (long story). Well, I guess that's about it. Toodles! P.S. I just realise that I made the stupidiest post ever,lol.haha.
