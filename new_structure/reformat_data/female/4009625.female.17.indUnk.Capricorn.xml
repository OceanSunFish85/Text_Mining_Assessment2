       The Olympic Games will be hold in Greece in Aug 13th this year.I would be at school that time.However,I will pay more attention to this great game cause I love my nation.  But I suppose that the total of the gold medal may not over 28.As a matter of fact, we are weak in some fields like track and field, swimming which has many items.There will be many gold medals.We are lacking in those good sportsman.  However,in my opinion,we'll have much surprise from the new sport stars.  Good luck!

      Well,I'm in the band named c'est la vie,and I'm the lead guitar player.  Three months ago I went to fashion front to buy DVDs.And I decided to buy two whose cover prints the electric guitars.So I bought the School of Rock and Freakey Friday.These two movies talks a lot about the rock band,which I am intersted in.  A 10-year boy call Zack in the School of Rock play this design of guitar--flying V     Shut up! It makes me crazy!To own it is my dream.But Ican'tfound it anywhere in GZ,like Tom Lee and Venson.  Maybe I will buy it in HongKong after my doing well in the NMET.

        After I went to the neworiental school these days, I suddenly realized that English is really an inportant thing ,especially in China.I think my oral English is quite well, and I always look down upon the person who has a bad pronunciation.In fact, in northern China many people don't speak pure English.Take "CCTV"for example,they say "say say tea way " instead.How terrible they speak Enlish!      By the way ,I prefer American English to British English.  I went to the neworiental school for improving my grammar and learning some exam's skills.NMET comes to me as the dayswent by.And I believe I can deal with the English examination very well.I became mature in this summer vaction,I'm not longer a child.I am seventeen , going on eighteen.Practise makes perfect!
