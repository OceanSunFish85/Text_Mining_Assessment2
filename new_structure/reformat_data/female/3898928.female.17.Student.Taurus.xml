						   Books I was really excited to get this book, âPractical Christianity in Crisisâ. A lot of people I know have already read it but I still want to read it for my self. Itâs quite interesting and there should be a few more books in the series. Today Iâm hoping to finish âGuilty Pleasuresâ, which was a birthday present from Lana. Itâs not a romance novel although the title might suggest it. After that I want to finish âA Rhyming History of Britainâ. Iâve only got three more sections left and two of them are short so it shouldnât take too long. After that I will only have âThe Sherlock Holmes Storiesâ to worry about, as well as âPractical Christianity in Crisisâ.  Music So, for the longest time Tchaikovsky was my favorite composer, then a few years ago I gave into temptation and decided I like Mozart more. Recently Iâve really been into Strauss but I think Iâm going to have to go back to Tchaikovsky being my favorite. âHeâs prettyâ¦â kind of like Mark if youâre in on that joke.   So, Iâve got to get back to work but next time expect some talk of movies and dance.  - Ã la prochaine

						   Alright, my first post was very random, I know. Iâve got another live journal where I attempt to keep some order. This is just for fun and because some of my friends have blogs here. I like to keep with the times. Anyway, Iâm off to the movies so, Later All!

						       So my new lap top should be getting here tomorrow. I'm really excited. I'm hoping it inspires me to be more productive on school work. I always seem to be behind schedule.     I got a new book today. Itâs the second book in the âAnita Blake: Vampire Hunter Series.â So far Iâm liking it.  Iâm also reading a book on Medieval History and a book on British History.      Tomorrow I have dance as well as school work and then Iâll probably pack Friday morning. I think weâre leaving in the afternoon for Cincinnati. Iâm excited and scared at the same time. Thatâs a whole other issue though.     Anyway, I just thought Iâd drop a line here since Iâve started updating my live journal account again. Iâll hopefully remember to update in a week or so., Au revoir!
