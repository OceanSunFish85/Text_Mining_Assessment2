            I met Joana on April, 13th 2001 on the IM chat. It was the time when I freshly moved to new city and my life was just occurring notable changes. I felt excited and full of enthusiasm, with big plans in my head drown into work. Optimism and good, fun mood was the typical sign of myself those times even more specially than usually. Joana came into my way as a person very much alike me â she was fun, self-confident, she had worked out opinions and mainly, she was crowded by life which was shooting and leaking out of her the way I could have felt the wetness on my hands. That was my first impression of her â the crazy and talkative girl, who likes to have people around, who talks to anyone, is not afraid and shy at all, who is aware of her capabilities and modesty isnât her strong side. It was what caught my interest on her and didnât let me forget her.       Even if this âfirst-impression Joanaâ was very interesting and magnetic to me, with the time flowing and us two getting closer to each other, I was slowly starting to be concerned about such a person. I, deep in my essence, was quite a sensitive person, reacting to details, getting affected by many things. And she felt sometimes too cool (super), and out of it too cold, too strong for me. I wasnât much like her and this difference felt unpleasant on me many times.      Now I know this girl, Joana, for more than three years already. We have not spent them body near body, but I can say we have spent them very intensively and with a tight contact. We have maybe been together more than normal couples, who share the same bed. It was a good opportunity to get to know Joana in details, deep into her soul and real, true way she is. Adding the 75 intensive days, spent together 24 hours daily, I can say I have quite a precise idea about my girl. During all this time my knowledge of Joana has been constantly updated. My Joana was getting developed from the âfirst-impression Joanaâ to the real Joana from the perspective of my mind. Development was long, complex and very detailed. As detailed and complex as the personality along with the relationship of a person can only be. During all this time miracles were happening. It was because slowly, step by step, Joana was converging from a âfun-to-talk girlâ âfirst-impression Joanaâ to âideal-girl-to-live-withâ real Joana. Besides few things, each detail that showed a more real Joana was nice to me. Each simple new piece of knowledge that I have discovered made me wonder and say âGod, I like this girlâ. And so it led to final discovery, that Joana was exactly the girl that perfectly fits myself and that I appreciate for she is very much like me. And that is ideal. If there is something not so fine or weird she does, I just stop and smile âhm, thatâs how I do too...â. If there is some really not important details that she claims about, I just stop and smile âhm, thatâs cool she is like thatâ. So how is she?   	              How my Joana is   My Joana is a mixture of feelings, properties and attitudes that give a wonderful result for me. If I would be designing the girl of my life, having to set millions of details, configurations, propertiesâ¦ I would most likely compose something a lot like Joana.       What I appreciate the most on Joana is that she is natural. What fascinates me the most on her is how cute she is â how she lives her life, solves her problems, deals with destiny. Joana, in my eyes, is a person who is configured to be closer to a practical, smart and rich (in soul) prototype of a personality.          She dispose of a perfect (for me) amount of each of the other ingredients though. So, she is sensitive, but not too-sensitive. She is understanding and she can show true feelings by her actions and behavior, but she does not give up to plenty of crying, sorrow and self-pity. She usually does not get affected by artificial or shallow emotions; she deals with hers in deep levels.      She is practical, fast and smart. She can deal with common or less common situations in life, she is independent and appropriately responsible. She does not get stuck on troubles, she always finds a way out. Rules and order are not her absolute values thought â she can risk, she can be lazy, she can do a spontaneous thing, she can be irresponsible. Thatâs what I love.            Joana lives naturally, she rarely manages herself. Joana can be impulsive, she doesnât need much to get excited, to get happy or to get sad. Her overview and mood stability isnât strong yet, she still doesnât resist the in-time affections of various kinds. Sometimes she has a little problem to take things easier, not to experience situations too dramatically. Sometimes she would need the ability to see and manage details as a part of one unit, when instead, she flies confused between its individual pieces.      Joana has character. She is typically her and does not change key attitudes and opinions by weather. Few rules and principles are always part of her, what makes you rely on her and trust her. And thatâs another valuable characteristics: she is reliable and trustworthy.       Joana declares true, non-material values â and this is the second thing I appreciate the most on her. Sometimes, she holds on them too much and approaches different things too seriously and critically, while she could take them lighter and with fun. But, she is also able to enjoy fun and meaningless things specially with the right person or people. She can say funny things, she can play and do funny things. She is quite open-minded and free to experience new things, but on the other side she approaches many things with prejudices.      Joana can be cold. But healthy cold. She does not allow to be taken advantage of. She is able to think straight and to protect herself from being abused. She has her pride, but she is not proud. She is a strong, experienced and wise person. She most usually states based on her true experience, what makes her be right in many things.      Joana likes to enjoy, she is passionate. There were times I was scared of this property, because I think that life is not just âto enjoyâ. Life is about something higher, about something long-term, not just about in-time joy. I am glad I found out later, that Joana wasnât a total âenjoyerâ. She likes to eat, she likes sex and she likes to sleep. In appropriate amount. Iâm glad we are very much the same in all these things.       Joana is impatient. Sometimes too much :) I think that many times she misses beautiful things by being like that. Sometimes I miss some deeper sense with her. But, itâs my Joana, impatient and impulsive girl, with a smile on her cute bally face that drives me nuts. And I love her for that.      For the end I must say, that no matter what details Joana has, how the little pieces of her personality and appearance are changing and developing, I just like her. I like her just because she is Joana. Itâs as simple as that. Maybe itâs not logical, maybe it doesnât make much sense. Maybe too simple, maybe crazy. But itâs so. I like my Joana and I will always like her. No matter what.   Milos 20.6.2004

       urlLink    That's how I must look today... such a mood, like doing not much, looking, maybe even thinking, even if Im terrible at that. It's a lack os happiness, of sadness, of words to express my feelings. It must be that I'm too full of it all, of the same places, people, things. I need to change urgently, to move, to act, to do, to be, to live again. Good that it's on its way... urlLink

      So, as you must know I have a boyfriend from Slovakia. We met 3 years ago, online through ICQ. During these 3 years we met twice already, once in Slovakia and then in Brazil. The last time we were together was in January/04, I miss him SO much! Next September Im moving to Slovakia for good. We want to start out life together, to have our own house, our work, to build our things. I can't wait for that already! This is my boy's company page: http://www.mad.sk He's a web designer, so he knows all about these internet things. I'm sure he does better than me in this blogging...

      I finally graduated! It was such a hard work with my final project, but I finally made it, and now Im feeling much better, lighter, calmer. IÂ´m now going to enjoy my last 2 months and some days in Brazil; IÂ´m going to my parentsÂ´ for couple months, and then back to Brasilia to arrange the last things so I can leave. I canÂ´t wait already! But for now, IÂ´ll just enjoy the last days in this beautiful and cool place Brazil is.

       urlLink    O frio chegou, e eu, como tenho muita sorte, estava em Chapada dos GuimarÃ£es. Pra quem nÃ£o sabe a cidade fica num chapadÃ£o, jÃ¡ Ã© fresco sem frente fria, imagine com uma. Ao menos fiquei em casa, vendo a neblina lÃ¡ fora, tomando chocolate quente, comendo rosquinhas doce. Ah, vida dura...  urlLink

       urlLink    Outro dia eu estava preocupada com uma coisa: como serÃ£o os sapatos na EslovÃ¡quia? serÃ¡ que vou achar alguma coisa que eu goste, e que nÃ£o seja europeu demais, que vÃ¡ tirar de mim a identidade brasileira? pois Ã©, procurei, procurei, e o que achei para os dias frios foi essa bota. NÃ£o precisava ser branca, mas atÃ© que Ã© legal.   urlLink
