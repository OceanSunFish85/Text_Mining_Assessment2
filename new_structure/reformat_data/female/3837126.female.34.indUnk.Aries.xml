       Well, the other day the most extraordinary thing happened. I was doing a Reiki treatment on myself and was working near the second chakra when I saw a beautiful little ball of light in my uterine area. This was decidedly not normal for me. I am not usually a visionary. I feel stuff but do not usually see them but this time I did.    It didnât take me long to figure out this could be a pregnancy. I looked at the date of my last period on the notes I keep and discovered that, yes, I was late.    So upon my next grocery shopping expedition, I bought an E.P.T. test kit without saying anything to anyone and last Sunday I took the first test. It was positive. Even given the evidence, it was hard to believe. I mean we had just 2 months ago decided that another baby wouldnât be too bad. We decided to leave it up to God and if it happens, it happens. It just didnât seem possible it would happen so fast after making that decision. So a few hours later, I took the other test. It was positive too.    I told my daughter first, she is 13 and was home and my husband wasnât. After we decided we couldnât wait to tell him, we took off and drove to the workshop he was at to tell him the good news. He was very happy.    Monday morning at 8 am I was on the phone trying to get an appointment with the doctor. My doctor called me personally and though he couldnât fit me in till the next day, he did order the blood test which is required to verify the home tests. I went and had the unsurprising results by 5.   Today I went in to see the doctor and though we didnât have to time for a formal prenatal check, he was able to address my concerns and take my history. He seemed as excited about the baby as I am. This doctor is a family practice doctor and is probably my favorite doctor of all time. But I wasnât certain he would be willing to take care of this pregnancy because with my history, it is considered a high risk pregnancy but he took it in stride and also was very encouraging about my Reiki as well. That is some doctor.    I have my first actual OB check on august 3rd where we plan to make certain there is only one baby and do the requisite tests and stuff.    So where did the name Whosit come from? Well, on Monday when I was speaking to the children about the baby, I ran up against the awkward language of someone trying to talk about a baby we donât have any idea if it is a boy or girl and we do not know anything else about. I didnât want to simply choose a sex because my son is young enough to latch on to it as the truth and be disappointed if it turns out to be different. So I was extending my sentences with âhim or herâ and âhe or sheâ and all that when my daughter caught on to the problem and dubbed the baby âBaby Whositâ. It seemed appropriate so thatâs how we began to call the baby Whosit.    I am going to blog this pregnancy so I can one day say to Whosit, âbefore you were born, you were bloggedâ. Also this will be a handy way of keeping records about my pregnancy and keeping my friends up to date on whatâs happening with Whosit.    Unless something happens in the interim, I will most likely be updating this when I have my next doctorâs appointment on august 3rd.    Until then,  Lylah
