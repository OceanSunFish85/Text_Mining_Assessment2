      I made a Dr. Appointment for me on the 31st @ 130 to check a spot on my hand.   I pray it is nothing!!!   Its kinda scary,  Ken says he thinks it cancerous.  BUT ya know..i have learned one thing in life...I will always be ok... so I say its not going to be anything..(positive thinking) ...but I hope they take it off..cause i hate the way it looks.  :-)    Just dyed my hair again..I love it this time... Cant wait for hair to grow longer........   I want some excerise equipment... wanna keep my self in shape. GEE  this is all about me...  I dont normally do that....   But now that I am on that subject...i have been pondering lately.... I listen to the people here at work talk.... men as well as women... and everything they say is "ME ME ME"  and when I ask well what does your wife think or what about your husband...i get this look like I am nuts... one person even responded....  who cares..what he thinks... Maybe it is just me...but I always try to think about what the other person wants/needs/or how they feel.   am I wrong for thinking this??  I think not!  but maybe so.... like I said...just pondering............

I know one day he is going to make it big.  I am so proud of him.  He came home yesterday and was telling us that a company that didnt even return a call on his resume, he will be teaching their whole IT security department... :-)  can you see my proudness showing through???????????  I keep telling him he is so smart.  One day he will realize it.  He is even going to have to go to California for SANS training.   My heart just swells for him.  Our kids are doing wonderful.  Kimberly broke my heart. She brought a test to me and Ken and she said.  I know I am not doing well....I need some help.  My heart broke into a million peice.  Bless kens heart.  He is going to get her to read to him every night.  Have I said how lucky I am lately?????????  I am extremely lucky.  Thought lately I feel as if he is so distant from me.  I dont want that to happen.  I truely love him.  I feel that I never knew what love was til now. I hope I dont screw it up...  well gotta go.

You all should of been proud of me and not mocked me. and stand next to my husband the one I love and adore,  and tell him thank you for standing beside me and making me realize what I didnt want to see and pray that he will be proud of me as well.

      Sometimes I think I love way too much...does that make sense???  I love Ken so much and I am afraid to show him how much..I guess I am afraid that I will get hurt.  We are looking into getting him a new vehicle.  I was wanting one myself.  But I have changed my mind.  I dont really care what people think ya know.  Screw them is my attitude.  If you dont like my mercedes....then stick it up your rear.   I really want to loose weight but I find it impossible not to eat at least something.  So I am going to try to eat a little at lunch time...and then that be my last meal.  I think I can do that.  I want to stay sexy for my baby....  See how my mind goes...I keep thinking and thinking....I want to clear my head.......well gotta go..am going to go help my mother n law move.

      well...I have a day of thinking.....the kids thrilled me (well 2 of them) by asking me to ask their dad to let them live with me.  I dont know why I am like them, I am scared to death of them, see their is one thing I know about him.,...it is that he usually gets what he wants..and I am so afraid that he will do something to make me loose the kids forever...and that is what my kimberly is scared of Work..i got to thinking about that today too....I had to sign something stating that I agree that they charge me 10 dollars in taxes every month..ya know its not the 10 dollars...but its the fact that they say I have to carry the cell phone...and that I have to be on call, and that I have to work that SAT....or answer the call at 2 am...then they are going to charge me for that ummmm luxery..then say you cant use the phone for personal use??  i have never used if for personal use and never will..but GEEEEEEEE I wasnt going to use this for bitching...but both have made me so upset that my teeth hurt from gritting....and I dont want to bother my ken about it....   well such is life.....I am just glad that I have my family...ken and all   4 kids..... i love them with all my heart......

      LOVE&gt;.....................I feel so loved!!!  I love it when I feel this way.    I have really been down on me lately...but tonight I have had a chance to rest and think.....  Yes ,... I have gained some weight... I can get it off ...... I know I can....  and you know what else ................... I can run a network too ... I will be given a chance... and I will prove it to everyone.  I also...will prove to TERRY SR&gt;  that I am not scared of his ass no more and I will get  my kids.  and Ken and I will have a wonderful family with our 4 kids.  I even understand why he doesnt want a 5th.  I am not upset with that any more either.  I Love my Ken with all my heart.  I will always want one of his children.  BUT... I know 5 is alot.   I will always love ken.  We always tease around about how much we love each other.  But let me tell you, the way he makes love to me, the way he makes me feel, no matter what I look like whether its a day that I feel like crap or a day I feel sexier than ever..he always tells me I am beautiful.  I know GOD meant for me to meet him.. and to love him... he knew exactly what each of us needed. .... BABY if you read this....I LOVE YOU

      I feel like shit again!!  I totally hate the job I am at.   I know  more that most of the people on the level above me.  Today one of the Engineers made a comment to the people at the bank we are working on that I am level one.Making me feel about an inch high.  I could of cried.   I really feel lately that I am not wanted...not needed...and stupid.  Cause if I was smart. People would want to hire me. I feel totally worthless when it comes to my carreer.  And why in the hell am I so scared of standing up to the kids real father????  I guess I know what he is capable of...and that really scares the hell out of me.  He could convince a nun that she had sinned...ya know what I mean???  He is good....so I dont know how to handle him.  Thank god Ken and all 4 kids love me....  I am not bitching...I am just getting things off my mind so I dont dwell on it.

      Oh my God!!!!!  Kimberly about Ripped my heart out.....not her fault....but Whenshe comes to me crying like she did or afraid to talk.....I break down... I cant stand it.   She wants to live with me so bad.  She says her daddy threw away her diary because she wrote in it that she wants to live with me.  He threw away both of her diaries...What kind of a dad would do that??  I know...a dad that never wanted you in the first place... He is such a sorry dad.....  now look at me... i have 3 children by a man who never wanted them....and I will never have children by a man who wanted  the child he had...(his ex will never know how lucky she was).   Why cant all dads want the children they create??  But its fine with me he doesnt want them..but he uses them as pawns to hurt me....GOSHHH  WHAT AN ASS I was married tooo...

      Today...I was all happy....well there are some things in my life that I am not happy about...but I didnt know I was living a lie.  Today..someone who knows about me...and I dont know.. sent me a message that my husband wasnt happy with me.  Says that I do not make him happy in bed.  (that cut me like a knife..says he is bored with me already).  Told me that he is not happy with the way I keep our home.  I have to admit on this one..I am not happy with that either.  I have been talking to a Dr. explaining to him that I seem to not be able to get anything finished.  He took some blood work, but asked me about the things I have been worried about (I had a huge list) and he said his wife got like that.. we are still waiting on the test results, but he told me to take a breather and relax and stop worrying.(did I say with relaxation and some understanding his wife is better)  Well I am about in tears again and I hate when I do that at work.  See here is where the lie is... I thought my husband was happy with me. So I went along all happily thinking some of my life may suck but I have this husband I thought he understood that its not that I dont care... I care alot... I hate the way  things are kept.  Now what do I do?  Here I am saving up for things to make his office look great.  I have not been eating lunch so I could save money to do this...Now dont I feel stupid.  Cause this person even told me he was upset cause I never finished his office...but I was just waiting on getting pics of the kids and from our wedding and wanting to order the posters and things....Why cant I do anything correct...why cant I make anyone happy??

      OHHHHHHHHHHHH  AGONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I swear I am having the LONGEST and WORST period every.  I feel like I am in constant PAIN!!!!  My darling husband is so sweet,  besides being so patient with me, he has been holding me so tight, and even laying his leg across my stomach to put pressure on it to keep the pain from being so bad!!!!!   I know I have the sweetest husband alive!!  I do love him so much.     I have to put in an insert concerning my DR appointment.,  I can tell the meds he put me on are working,  I am trying to hard to catch up on the house and things so I can finally be caught up and continue to keep a clean home.  But we have been through alot lately, and my poor baby keeps getting sick and my sweet hubby even broke his leg....GOODNESS!!  I feel so bad for them.  The older kids have been ok.  Kimberly was put on some meds for ADD but I do not like that at all.  Austin has been acting up, but he is still so sweet.   He wants to live with me so bad just like his sister.  Terry jr, well he really tries hard to be good, but sometimes he has to let go.   I think its the BIG brother syndrome.  I am so happy I have 4 wonderful children.

      I feel like shit.  We had friends coming over and I got up after a rough night of not sleeping and worring, and cleaned the house and wanted to make everthing look perfect for our friends and my husband.  I had a whole 2 hours of sleep.  Well they got here, and now look at me...I am at home again.  Everytime we get a chance to go out I get stuck at home. Last time I could not go because we have no sitter.  The time before that we did actually leave the house, His Aunt started acting up,we went home.  She went back out, he went to his friends house and guess what I stayed home and cleaned.  This time noone wanted to wait for the sitter.  You have no idea how I felt when I was told that I have to stay here. Sometimes I feel like such an outsider.

      I am so frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want to clean my nasty ass house but I cant seem to find the time to do it right or I start but can never finish it.  By the time I leave work it is 600-630 and I dont get home til about 630-700.  Then I cook dinner and feed everyone (I usually eat standing up so I can get done faster) then I  make sure homework is done ,bath children,. Pickup the Kitchen  notice I did say pick up and not clean. by the time  i get a chance to go to the bathroom its 11 o'clock at night.  Then I think....  I can clean now...then I am too tired to do it .  My job is so mentally exhausting that It is hard to function when I get home.     I will clean my house,  I do not want to live in a pig stye.  I am so tired of it.  But, when I do get it clean I dare anyone to leave a mess.  I will go OFF&gt;  I know I will.   I think my family is staying sick cause I cant get our house clean.   I want a HEALTHY AND HAPPY family.

      oh hum... Yesterday was a bad day for my Ken. I wanted to hold him all night long and make hard passionate love to him.  Sad thing is...I didnt feel like he wanted me.  this has really made me upset.  He laid next to me and masterbated....I normally do not care.  But this nite...I really wanted him.  I get up early so I laid down knowing he needed to have some unwind time.  Then he didnt really go to sleep until it was time for me to get up.  I am not really taking this personally..But it does hurt my feelings...I want my hubby to lay next to me and hold me all night.  Guess I am selfish for that.  But I dont like this feeling that he does not want me.  It really makes me feel awful.  I have been feeling bad since gaining some weight. (but I am working on that)....But I know he still loves me...I just want him to desire me.

      UUGGHHH......What a day...Why cant people leave MY family alone. I am talking about my family as in my husband, terry, kimberly Ausitn and Brian.  It started this morning.  Mawmaw called to see how Mymommie was doing.,...and how was her heart.  I told her that I think she is doing ok that I havent heard from her.  She started talking about what happen the other night and How she was told it was Mine and Misty's fault for taking the kids over there.  Well I told her it was my fault I am the one who asked Dad to watch the kids.  I am the one who was suppose to bring them over. If I knew what was going on then I would have not let my 4 children go.  I told her that I did not know what to say when the boys asked my what a Whore was.  She asked how Ken was...I told her that after the argument that him and mom had I was very worried about the both of them.  WEll the next thing I know I am getting another phone call from MOM......asking what did I tell MawMaw...well come to find out that mom told mawmaw she didnt cuss in front of the children and I let the cat out of the bag when I mentioned what the children heard...I didnt mean too...then she said why did you tell her what went on at my house..I didnt I just said they had an arguement.  Well Mom told me that she was going to tell Ken what a lousy DAD he is and that I am the one raising Brian.  That is not true.  Ken does alot with all of the kids and she has no right to say anything like that about my husband.  Well when I said yes he does do things with them she named off stuff a mom would normally do anyways....uugghh...THEN in the car Mawmaw called....She said she just got off the phone with mymommie and they had it out cause mawmaw told mymommie that she must not really love ken and brian and us because she is dragging us in it and hurting Ken in the process.  She then said that she told mymommie that if she is not careful about what she says around Brian then all that we have fought for will be gone.  That Stacey will find a way to take Brian away.  Then she said mom told her that if she called the HRS right now..that they would take all 4 kids away.  (this is not true.  i have been working real hard on getting caught up on all of this.) But me and my big mouth repeated what Mawmaw had said.  And Kimberly heard it.  The first thing Kimberly did when she got in the house was start throwing up.  It made her so upset. I asked her what was wrong and she asked me who would call the HRS  and make them take them away from me and Daddy (that is what our daughter calls ken).  I told her not to worry about it cause it would not happen...But I hated to see her have that reaction. I do love my family and I love mom and Dad...but why ...I dont understand any of this.  I am not going to question it I am not going to mention it to Ken....cause I dont want him any sicker than he is...but it does seem that I may have to start posting here alot to keep me sane.  I dont want to go off on anybody messing with my family.  But I will.  NOONE is going to seperate us 6.  THIS IS MY FAMILY and I will fight anyone who wants to tear us apart.

      MY HUSBAND...... I love my husband with all my heart.  I hope he really does know much Love him.  I am so mad at his mother right now that it isnt funny.  She knows that he is a depressive person and that we have been struggling..not personally but with finances....and what does she do?? She drags him in the middle of her and his dad.  I love my mother n law very much....but I hate to see my Husband treated that way. I was so worried about him last night.  I was afraid he was pushed tooo far last night.  He doesnt realize how much I worry about that and it does make me angry when I see someone who knows about him ... to push him that far....  I am also upset that she talked in front of the kids the way she did.  Brian and Austin told me that she yelled at them to be quiet when they tried to talk to her when they were at their Dadaddies. And they both asked my what a WHORE was.  Because she kept saying that in front of the them that their Dadaddy had his whore in her house.  I wish the kids would of never went over there.  I pray to god that Brian doesn't go to his mothers house and say what he heard.  We have fought so hard for him that I pray nothing ever happens to turn the judges decision around.  I know she is hurting and I do understand.  But I pray for now on that Ken and the Kids do not get stuck in the middle.  I never knew I was capable of loving someone as much as I love him. They also say that you cant love a child that is not yours as much as you do your own...that is  a LIE.....I love Bri - Bri just like if I was the one who had him.  Well I guess I should stop writing,,,but my mind is so full....and I am so scared and worried about my husband right now. I have been praying ever night that God takes special care of him to help him through all of this.

      Lately I have felt as if Ken doesnt find me attractive anymore.  I have been trying to diet. But now...I am going to do more than that...I am going to Diet.  I cant figure out what else may be wrong.  I want my husband to want me.  In the last month he has stayed up more than laying down with me.  I know his back is hurt and I know I was on my period.  But I truely feel as if he isnt interested in me.  Damn it my heart hurts.  But I will do what ever I can to make him want me again.

      I am so PISSED off that it isnt funny.  I dont think I have been this mad in a long time.  I should of known when I woke up in such a wonderful mood.  Did 2 loads of laundry a dishewasher full of dishes got my son up and cooked for him and my husband, I felt great!!!!    The day at work was a Monday but I could handle it.  Then my private line rings.  Its Amy.   Asking me if ken was going to go to work today!   I said yes he is going to try hard to get there.  She said Well I need to know now not later.  I called Ken to make sure he was feeling kinda ok.  He was in pain and took some meds he was going to wait for the meds to set in before going to work.  WELL I called that bitch back to let her know then she started in on me, she said that she needed to know now and that she couldnt wait til later to find out if she needed to find someone to teach this class.    She said the classroom needed to be set up and I asked if she was sure.  One of the classes the students do it.   She started in on me....WELL rick said....blah blah blah....YOU KNOW WHAT....I dont give a FUCK what RICK says.   He needs to keep his ass out of that OFFICE . I am so tired of people like that BITCH and like the COKE snorting geek to walk all over ken.  And now look...I am so pissed off I cant enjoy my family tonight.   Why cant everyone leave my family alone?????   Ya know....Ken is doing what he loves but he cant enjoy it.  I realized a while back that I wanted to work for a company and do some networking while teaching the others the enjoyment Networking can be, like Ken did me.  And because someone ran their mouth and lied saying that he took took my MCSE tests that I didnt get the job that Justin had promised.  DAMN IT...... and now I am stuck in this stupiud ass position talking to users who cant even remember to take a floppy out of the drive. Or loose their shit cause  you tell them not to stoere stuff on the hard drive and then their computer crasses, or the user who fucking cant even find the start button.  NO WAIT the best one yet.  The vice president of the bank who blames you for him typing in the generic password wrong , when all it is , is the name of the company and he says its your fault he cant spell it write.  UUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   if I find out who told him that Ken took my MCSE after I studied hard and sent my kids to my moms for a month so I could do nothing but study, and .....I will kill that mother fucker.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have only had a few dreams in my life and being an Engineer was one of them,  I have a couple of more some will come true some wont.........but damn it.   someones lie is  going to keep me from doing my dream.  I just knew if I got in with a small company then a larger company would notice me.  Or we could of made that company big.  Oh well....aint nothin I can do about it now,...what is said is said.....what is done is done.......But I warn ya now.....I will slap the cunt if she talks to me again in that tone of voice.  This is a warning and a promise.  It is not a threat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

      I never talk about sex / love making between my husband and my self.   But, last night I cried when he was making love to me.  Not because it was rough, not because he hurt me.  But because, I have never felt such love and tenderness in all my life.   It was the most amazing time I have ever had.   He made love to every inch of my body. The feeling of his hands running gently across me as he made me shut my eyes and not open them as he caressed me not knowing where he would touch next.  His sweet, tender Kisses.  The  words that he was saying to me.  Hearing the love in his voice when he  told me he loved me over and over again. We of course had made love a lot, had sex a lot, fucked a lot.  but last night was just amazing. The true  feeling of love.     This was truely one of the best nights of making love that we have ever had.  The other one I would put above this and I cried that night too, was the night we made love that it was so wonderful that he set the date for the wedding.  I never knew I could love someone like this and to be honest, sometimes its scary.  I want to protect my heart.  But I know deep down I dont need to protect it from him.  One of these days I will let me guard 100% down and he will realize that I love him as much as I say I do.  I thank God every morning and every night that he gave me such a wonderful family.  He gave me kimberly and austin and terry..knowing I would gather strength, and wisdom and give my love to and grow with.  He gave me Brian and ken to also share my love with, I have so much to give all of them. I think he gave me Brian to grow with as well, and to love with a special love. But Ken, I think he gave me him for a special reason.  God knew that I had love to give, but he also knew that I needed love and I did not know (dont) how to accept it.  I think he put us 2 together, because he knew we both needed true love and he knew Ken would teach me, not only to accept love but to teach me how to be love and how to give love to a man.  I know this sounds sappy.  But I really KNOW not think...that Ken is my  soul mate.

      I have learned. I am not a good person.  I went out last night, with the intent to get my nipples peirced.  I had to wait on the guy so Misty said lets go have a drink.  I didnt think my husband would mind.  I thought it would relax me. We got the drink and then went and got the percing.  WEll husband did mind. I screwed up my marriage and I am not sure if I can fix it.  My heart hurts, my neck hurts, my throat hurts. My nipples hurt.  I was told last night I was a bitch ,.  Well I guess I am....I was told I was like Stacey. That hurt me more than anything.  I try to make sure he has everything he needs and some of what he wants.  I didnt realize I was such a bad person, but I do know now.  I was told I was having an affair.  He said with my ex husband.  That is the grossest thing that I have ever heard.  If that man ever touched me again I would cut off his dick..cut off his hand and place the dick in it.  I was the scaredest I have ever been last night, why? becuase I let a drink come between my husband and me.  It didnt scare me that I was held down.  hurt like hell, not breathing is scary but I must of deserved it.  Just like I told Misty, he wouldnt hurt me without a reason cause he loves me.    I will never go to a family function again.  Cause all knows.   I wont tell them I made him so mad that he held me down by the throat, that is embarrassing,(I didnt mean for that to happen) I wish the bruises on my neck were not there, and the scratches on my face cause I dont want anyone to know.  His mom must of told maw-maw,  cause now she is calling.  I guess everyone thinks I am Stacey now.  Is there need to stay in this family? Yes there is, because I love him.  But I will NEVER go to family functions again. cause NOW I know that I will be treated as Stacey and I am no stacey.  I gucked up one night.  I have to go get my house in order.  I wont have time ever again to sit down and type. So I say GOODBYE to everyone.

      I dont know what to think about me any more.  I use to think I was a good wife and a good mother.  But I must not be.  The other day,  I made Ken a dinner that really sucked.  I was trying to make a great dinner and it turned out to be the worst ever.  Then he told me how I should keep our house clean but I dont.  It is my responsiblity, but I cant seem to get it done.  I have been trying hard to play catch up.  Tonight I am staying up to finish the laundry. But today out of no where.  My mother n law came over, returned her computer?!  (still not sure why) and then told me that she would be coming over to help me clean house and iron everyweek,  That really made me feel inadequate.  Plus the oldest 3 really acted up today.  But I truely think that is because they had to go home to their dads and did not want to. But it made Ken feel like they were picking on Brian.  So see...I am not a good wife, and not a good mother.  Cause if I was either,  none of this would of happened.  It seems the harder I try, the worse I get.  DAMN IT!!  I really hate me.

      I have so many thoughts running through my head.  I asked Ken to take me for a drive last night.  But the kids were all up late.  I wanted to talk to him.  But last night again, he got up set with me and didnt come to bed until morning.  He accused me of not wanting to blow him any more.  That is so far from the truth. He doesnt know that in our fight the other night a tooth got broke.  IT HURTS...and that in the inside of my mouth I had a HUGE swollen layer on the inside of my lip with a cut on it.  It hurt to eat more less blow.  But I didnt want to tell him cause I did not want to hurt him,  But come to find out.  It hurt him cause I didnt blow him.  I do love him with all my heart and I didnt know if it would hurt him if he knew I really got hurt the other night.  One more bruise left and It will all be over with.  THANK GOD!!   I love my husband with all my heart and I will never do anything like that again.

      I am so pissed at my ex -  He made me live through HELL when I was pregnant knowing he did not want the babies he created.  But, then he gets his Girlfriend pregnant and he is thrilled.  And to beat all..he is going through the clothes I saved that my kids had when they were little, and is going to let his new baby wear then.. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.....  You know what I dont understand why do guys want babies by other people and not by me?  I wish Ken was the dad of my children he is a wonderful father.  I love to watch him with Brian, and with the older kids!    He plays with them, loves on them, scolds them.  He is so perfect!   I found the most perfect man.

      My darling Husband did it.  He got the job.  He went to sign the papers today.  and then we had lunch.   It is so wonderful to see him as happy as he has been the last two weeks.  I keep telling him I have all the confidence in the world in him.  He doesnt realize sometimes just how smart he is.  Its just not smart.,  Its the Knowledge that he has and his ability to actually put it to use.  I think that is one of the things that attracts me to him too...I love a smart man.    Ok now on a uggh note.....I dont know why I am so afraid to show him how much I love him. I tried last week, but it was at the wrong time, and was accused of just loving on him cause he got that job.  Which isnt the truth...but did want to show him how proud I was/am of him.    Another note:  I am so glad that our baby Brian is back home.  Last week, we all 5 missed him so much....but this week I am having real problems missing the oldest 3.  I dont know when the last time it has hurt this much not to have them with me.  I am so lonely for them.   I am also having some serious problems with sleep...I cant seem to do it.  I am tired.  but cant seem to sleep...What is up with that??  My medicine for calming my nerves is missing as well.  Thats a whole other story....

      Why does not anyone ever listen to me?  I have tried to explain to everyone how it makes me feel and they seem to not care at all.  I dont mind help I really do not, but... I can iron.  I dont mind helping me match since I cant see some colors....But it makes me feel so Inadequate when someone has to come into my house and do something I should be doing.  I have tried to be nice about it... and I did not mean to get ill, I could not help it,  I just wanted to cry.  It makes me feel that I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing and that I am a failure.   I have said this...over and over again...but yet noone cares.  It makes me think also that they do not like the job that I do when I do iron (which is every day but weekends) .   AND.....I NEVER!!  let the kids leave without combing their hair and brushing their teeth!   What it looks like when they come home from school I cant help.   Well I am done steaming....Its not really steaming its just that my feelings are really hurt.  I mean hurt bad.

      Yesterday,  Everything was going as normal.   MyMommie picked up Brian from school.  I met them at the gas station.   Brian asked if he could go in with me when I was going in there to pay.  He kept holding myhand and saying...I love you mommy. I love you mommy.  Of course I was telling him I love him too.   Well when they left he kept calling me, just to say I love you and to chat.  I finally asked him what is wrong because Brian does not really like to stay on the phone and talk.  He told me he did not want to go at all today.  He says that alot...but today...I know he is serious.  After I talked to Him he talked to his Daddy.   After talking to his daddy, Stacey called and demanded to have Brain for 30 days.   That is not how it works.  It is not what is in his divorce papers.   After both of them cussed at Ken we called our attorney.  He in turn called them and let them know that we will be filing for a clarification of terms, and that they could keep my baby for a week.  But we must get him back.  will finish later.   6/6/03 Well it sounds as if we wont get our baby through the summer except for weekends.  UUGGHH....I will miss him sooo much.....  I want all 4 of my kids around all the time.    I really hate that his mom wants him to be around the abuse that goes on in that house.   I know we are basing it on what a 5 year old says...but I know he would not make up what he has said.

      ok.....Why won't it go away??  I don't understand.    The more I fight the feeling the more it comes.  I swore I would never write on this again.  but I since I am pretty much sure noone ever reads this.....But......I truely crave to have his baby.  I want a part of him to grow inside me. to nuture.  and to know that when the baby is born that the baby will have a dad who loves her/him intensly.  And have grandparents around too.   I know he does not want a child (which I do but dont understand) I try real hard to cover my feelings about this..but sometimes it makes me ill.  (which I dont understand at all either)  I do not know how to explain this but love....I love him so much...I want something of his...something we can share...something that we can both love and grow with.  also,  noone could ever take this child away from us.     OK...I am about to cry again...but I had to write this out ...so I can STOP thinking about it.You know, when someone asks you....what do you reallly want????????  all I can think of is to have my Kens baby.............................I pray that I can stop this feeling....its hurts my heart so.... to know I cant give him and he does not want...the one thing that I want to give him.........Please lord take this feeling away..........

      I feel so sick to my stomach.  Its a little of combonation of cramps....and a ucky feeling.  This weekend  We went to see my parents.  Ken and I got into an arguement on the way down there.  I didnt realize how unhappy I made him.  He gave me an ultimatum. I have to get the house clean in 2 days or he leaves me.  I am worried til I am so sick.  I hated leaving my mom.   I had to make my kids (well atleast 2 of them) go with their dad cause they did not want to. And now I am so worried that I am loosing him.  He has been asking me what is wrong.  I dont want him to know I am worriing.  I actually feel like I am going to throw up.  I hate feeling ill.  But I do not want to go through life with out him.  The sad thing is ....  I truely understand why he would leave me and I dont blame him an inch.  I wish I could be a better wife.  I am going to pray all night that GOD makes me a better wife and mother.  I feel so lonely tonight.  I want to be held.  I am no where near having the house clean.  but If I dont lay down I will get sick.   I just wish I could sleep some.  I do love him so.

      my heart hurts. My baby is wants to leave me.  How did it come to that?  It is all my fault.  I dont like feeling this way.  I want to show him that I love him.  But at the same time.  I am scared to show him cause it will hurt me even more when he leaves.  This is tearing me up.  I really do not think that he knows how much my love is for him.

      I dont understand why, when I think things are starting to look up and going to start being great, that it seems as if  I am wrong.  I dont know why he is so distant from me these last 2 days.  I have tried to show him I love him.  I have wanted to make love to him badly. (Unfortunately he is sleeping durning alot of those times).  I just want to go in wake him up and devour him.  He thinks I do not want him.  I do not know what to do. I do not want to loose my husband, I truelly love him.  I have to figure out a way that he knows all the time that I love him.  Next weekend is our annivserary.  They say the first year is the hardest.  I sure the hell hope so.

      This last week has been amazing.  Its like my ken and I have re-discoered our selves together.  It is so wonderful!!  Its amazing to me how I could love someone and feel as loved as I do right now.  He is the most awesomest (is that a word) person that I know.  He always ask me why I love him,  that is the hardest answer to give.. its not one thing in general...its a lot of littlle and not so little reasons why.  But I have to say its his intelligence that attracts me the most.  He has got to be the geekiest ;-)  smartest man I know....makes me wet just thinking about him.  Well He is at work today and I am going to go get the baby from grandmas.   We had the last 2 nights to ourselves..(you would think I would be drained ;-)   , but I just want to start all over again, making love to him).  We use to stay in bed ALL day long never getting out. but I had to go to work ;-(       Well...I just feel like my heart is going to explode with all of this feeling.    I just had to share it .  LOVE IS GRAND!!!!!!!!!!   Oh....and for those who love movies...we went out last night to the movies and seen Bad Boys 2.   IT is the most funniest movie  I had watched in a LONG time!!  </post></Blog>
