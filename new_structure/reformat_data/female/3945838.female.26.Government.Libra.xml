      Seeing that I'm known for going off on bitter diatribes about miniscule parts of life I'm going to write about a couple of the things that annoy me.    I'm annoyed with very few things in life. The problem is that these very few things REALLY annoy me. For instance bike riders. Yes, they annoy me. On the bike trail they scare me by flying past while I'm running. On the street they are supposed to abide by the same traffic laws as cars but instead drive past you when you're at a stop light and you're forced to maneuver around them until once again you're at a another stop light and they do it again.     Another thing that annoys me is being disappointed in someone. Yes sounds silly I know but itâs a big part of how people get to me. If you say you're going to call - CALL. Essentially if you say you're going to do something do it- otherwise don't say you're going to do it. That's not hard- is it? The golden rule is not hard to follow. If someone can't follow this simple rule we all learned in kindergarten Sunday school you have a serious problem. Treat others the way you want to be treated. That's not hard to do - is it? I didn't think so but evidently some people just fail to recognize how to treat people. I can be disappointed in a person maybe three times before put them on the flake list. Disappointment in someone is covered under my mentality for cheaters as well. I hate cheaters- some may say this is due to my own issues. Yeah, yeah so what if it is. Cheaters are bad people. You can reform yourself and what ever but you are what you are and if you're presently cheating you're not a good person. Karma will come after you- trust me.  That's about it for now. I can't think of anything to go off on at the moment but once I think of it trust me I'll type it all up.

      Okay, seeing that this is my first post I must admit that I don't know what to write.  I believe what this will turn into isa place for me to say whatever I'd like to say and essentially gripe about what annoys me in this world.  My truck was broken into the other day. The window smashed, purse stolen. The funny part was that it was parked in broad day light near a running trail where many people were working out. I HATE THIEFS. I see no reason for their existence and if it were up to me we would do like they do in third world countries and cut off their hands. Yeah, yeah some would go with the argument that they're unable to afford the niceties in life and its not the criminal's fault that they had to steal- give me a freaking break. Karma wise they're screwed. Plus, there's that special place in hell that thiefs go to. For the $0 they received and the 5+ hours of hell I went through having to cancel my cards I hope they're satisfied.
