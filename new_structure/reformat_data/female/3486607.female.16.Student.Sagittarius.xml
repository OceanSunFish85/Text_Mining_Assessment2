       Tomorrow my parents are having a Memorial Day cookout. So today I'm working my ass off cleaning the house. It's not too bad except that right now I've been working on the bathroom, which means ive been trapped in a small room with a lotta chemicals.....feeling a little sick now.  Well anyway....I wanna know what you all think of this place. If you know how to better it, please let me know, I could really use some help.

        This is my first post ya'll. It seems as though everyone else is getting sites and I'm curious as to how well my blonde brain can handle this, woohoo! I'm obviously in the process of setting it up, so give me some feedback and let me know what I need to do and/or fix to make this sucker work. I'll probably go to James for help on this thing. Well off to figure out what i can do with this baby!

      Well everyone is finally gone. I feel really drained and really alone. I hate feeling this way. No matter how many people I may be talking to or be around, I just feel so totally alone, lost in the world, fighting to find my way to the surface. I'm stuck in something that I'm not sure i can get out of, the worst part is that I cant specifically pick out what has me trapped.

      We are having a Memorial Day picnic a day early. My house is filled with people. My uncle john brought this guy Josh.....I know I've seen him before, but still........OMG he is so fucking hot!!!! And he is bi! I love gay and bi guys, they are hot and cool. On the other hand today is also kinda a downer...people dont stick to their word. I had two friends tell me that they would call me today, one when he got up and the other when he got home. I haven't gotten any calls today. Oh well, I didn't really expect the first to call, he never does when he says he will. The other I did expect to call, but I'll live. Also I've had Nicky all day without anyone to really help me with him. Its a  fight to find someone willing to take him so that I can go to the bathroom. Hell, my biggest help was Josh and he ain't even family.

       Oh it's about time i got to this. The point of this site is mainly ranting. A way to get things out, not always bad either, sometimes you just gotta rant about all the goodness. If you'd like to become a writer on here to be able to get things out, let me know. I also have the tag board so we can all comunicate like one big happy family. This is a release site, no more games, no facades, just honest writting, with the occasional thing that makes no sense whatsoever. If you don't like that. Oh well!

       Wow! I just spent about two hours or so putting together a post for James' site. He should feel really lucky. Any of ya'll that are reading this and don't know James' site go to it its:                http://logosamor.blogspot.com/   You can also get there by going to his profile on here and choose from his many sites. They are all good.   Oh anyone that likes the tagboard.....thank James, it was his doing. I am so totally incompetent with technology. Oh well!

       Oh people really annoy me sometimes. First you got those that have to know everything that you are saying to another person. Then those that lie to get their way, those that lie to attempt not to hurt another. There are those that say one thing and then act entirely opposite of that. Then there are the "friends" that dont want anything to do with you over something so incredibly stupid. Ah, the people who think that they should kill themselves because of another person. Those that mess around with others feelings. The people that like to hurt others to make themselves feel better. And then just those that have been annoying me.  If you are reading this and happen to fall in the catagories, I'm sorry. This doesn't even apply to some people. Just my way of getting out my frustration and anger at certain people that are annoying me lately without using names and offending people.

      Oh my goodness, I posted somethin! Holy crap.  Anyways, I noticed something... Why exactly is it that both the pages that Katie 'owns' (per se) are negative? Katie's Hellhole and Life of the Lonely, really doesn't sound fun... nope. I have an idea!!! We can come up with a new blog and call it  urlLink PansyFruitMuffin  and have it be all gleeful and stuff, wouldn't that be fun? ....No? Well, I tried anyway. Back to the negativity, I'm done being stupid for now.

       Well it's been awhile since I've posted. I don't really have much to rant about right now......  Here is a song that I love, it's one of my absloute favorites. Yeah, yeah, yeah.....I know, it's a sappy stupid song to some of you, but oh well you'll get over it.      Because You Loved Me     by: Celine Dion    For all those times you stood by me For all the truth that you made me see For all the joy you brought to my life For all the wrong that you made right For every dream you made come true For all the love I found in you I'll be forever thankful baby You're the one who held me up Never let me fall You're the one who saw me through through it all  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You gave me wings and made me fly You touched my hand I could touch the sky I lost my faith, you gave it back to me You said no star was out of reach You stood by me and I stood tall I had your love I had it all I'm grateful for each day you gave me Maybe I don't know that much But I know this much is true I was blessed because I was loved by you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You were always there for me The tender wind that carried me A light in the dark shining your love into my life You've been my inspiration Through the lies you were the truth My world is a better place because of you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  I'm everything I am Because you loved me    Written By: D.

      o0o0o0o0o My baby Jaime joined! Yay! But she don't know what to write... boo... Something will come of it, I can feel it in my toes! Or is my foot just asleep? Either way I'm feeling something tingly here. All kinds of new paths are presenting themselves at this very moment, well, maybe not, but I'd sure like to look at it that way. Kinda like earlier today... it was quite boring ya know, all I did was clean my car. But you put a whole new spin on it when you mention that I nearly killed myself with Raid because my car happend to be infested with angry wasps and ugly big nasty spiders, then its an adventure. Made for TV movie I tell ya. But I don't know what the heck I'm talking about, I'm too darn tired. I think some sleep ought to do me some good. So, adios amigos, the village idiot James must run off to bed now.

      Yeah its been awhile, I know. And it sucks, but it's gonna be longer. My parents are being a pain and I'm not allowed online. They also said I am only allowed the phone to talk to Malcolm (for any that didnt know, that's my boyfriend ^_^), so I'm getting annoyed with them a lot, but I must keep my control. I'll write when I can.

      ... I was awakened by an awful stench. To my greatest horror, the giant branch that fell on me, was actually the cow itself. And the incredibly terrifying stench was its crap, on my face. This is turning out to be the worst day of my life, I should run home and clean up now but...

      and then it happened a giant branch came down on me.  I was knocked out.  I then dreamed of a beautiful world where everyone was biped versions of animals.  It was totally amazing there were many people there some wonderous with wings while others were dragons.  In this great dream world there were other dream worlds and each one was just as unique as the last i couldn't believe the site.  This world was totally amazing and i wish i could never leave....................

      I nearly crapped my pants when all that happened. Not only was I beaten to within an inch of my life, but she threatened to castrate me too. I ran for my life, and my genitals.  I tried to run as fast as I could, as far as I could. But apparently I couldn't, seeing as how I ran into the tree, very fast, although not very far.  It happened to be that same tree that had the cow in it . . .

      ...Until some odd woman came up and started beating the crap out of me.  I felt very amused and ashamed at the same time, laughing because she was rather short, but she was managing to hurt me.  "Ever mention those cows again and I'll castrate you!" She shrieked.   Geez, what does she have against cows?
