      From the Mind of a Freak   I have no idea why I am typing this, I mean, who cares what a 14-year-old girl thinks about her country and the problems in it. Who cares how a little girl views people? See those ants over there? Theyâre more than a billion of them, and Iâm the one all the way to the right next to the ant carrying the moth. I am just one of billions, and according to the people around me, Iâm a scary freak with nothing better to do with life than sit in corners. So now Iâm out of the corner, and does anyone really care? Probably not. But Iâll make the best of it.   To start off, Iâll start talking about people in general. They think, âThat person has a black shirt on, they must be bad.â Or âThey donât believe what I do, they must be evil.â Just because someone does what he or she wants and not what everyone else thinks is ânormalâ that doesnât make him or her a bad person. If you come up to them and say something nice to them, they wonât pounce on you. Come up and bad mouth them, then theyâll fight back. But of course, people are people and they fear difference. Why is that? Because the idea of a perfect âsocietyâ is one where everyone is the same. It will not work, however. You cannot take a group of people and make them all the same; human nature is to rebel against that sort of thing. No one can suppress this nature. So then why do people try to? Why do they bother? Because at the same time, people also have a nature of being scared of other people not like them. Although, some can overcome this nature, more so when someone is older but sometimes he or she cannot get over the fact that not everyone is exactly the same. And they donât have to be the same.    This is where therapists come in, these professionals tend to try and change someone for the better of the whole. Although, I wonât be so stereotypical as to say all are like that. Some even encourage difference. But some just wonât get off your back. Anything that doesnât seem right to their perspective must be changed at all costs, doesnât matter what the person thinks. And if something is wrong, they have a pill for that. Cover up sorrow with a happy pill; people shouldnât learn to deal with the fact that he or she will be sad at times. Once again, not all are like that, but I canât help to notice this fact when people talk about mental health and therapy. Therapists are paid to âcareâ; Iâd rather talk about my problems with someone who cares about me and not their paycheck.    Arrogance is a huge problem as well. All the school kids are laughing at people from other countries. Why? Because they sound funny. What? They sound funny why? Their accents arenât funny, its just the way they talk, get over it. Itâs not a big deal. But the children of our country cannot understand this they are learning to hate. Where are they learning this? From those that do hate. All it takes is one person to hate for someone to copy them and it keeps going like a chain. The hate chain probably will never be broken, but it can be decreased. We have to slow and try to stop a large majority of the arrogance or this country will not flow, the current is already slowing down. If we canât learn some respect then we cannot unite together because weâd hate whom weâd be uniting with.   Now Iâm going to change topic to something more debatable, Iâll start off local with Gay Marriages (I live in MA). Another example of fearing difference, and itâs more of a religious battle than anything else. I really donât care if that man kissed that other man; itâs not going to kill me. I have worse problems to worry about then marriages. Itâs not their fault theyâre gay, they didnât choose it, itâs the way they are. If they could, donât you think theyâd try to act straight? But no, the bible doesnât like two guys kissing, so lets get this whole country mad about this because we can. Its not as though gay couples are coming out with assault rifles and shooting everyone. Let it go, we have worse problems to deal with. Mind your business.   This also brings up abortion, another religious topic. A baby is a very life-changing occurrence. But the thing is, itâs not my business if a parent decides that they would make a bad parent. If we made abortion illegal, the cloths hangers would come out and more than a fetus would die. Either way, the deed is done, and we already decided to make abortion legal. We are overpopulated as it is, and a fetus is apart of a womanâs body, and they canât have an abortion if they wait too long because then itâs considered a baby and can feel pain. If the lady doesnât want to be a mother, let her do what she wants with her body. But if she keeps coming back then sterilize her so she can stop wasting the abortion doctorâs time. Letâs move on and stop worrying about other peoplesâ business. The fact is, I donât care about someone not having a baby. I have better things to worry about then something that has already been decided.    This brings me to politics. I donât hate Bush; I hate his administration and the CIA for screwing us over. But Bush is a puppet with literacy problems. However, I like what he did in Afghanistan, but then he went to Iraqâ¦what? I thought Bin Ladenâs men attacked my country. Saddam was doing his own thing, it may have been bad but we had no business to take over his country. He may have been a horrible leader, but thatâs his problem and his peoplesâ problem. Or it was. We couldnât find Bin Laden so we went after the nearest Muslim. Bushâs daddy should have killed Saddam a long time ago, but Iâll give his Father some credit, he probably did send a sniper out who failed. It happens. But we should be finding the guys who hit our country, not someone who may have owned some powerful weapons. Saddam was smart enough not to attack America, so we went over and attacked him. No self-defense, we were just bullies in a playground. If Bush had said, âSaddam is a bad man, lets get âem Johnny!â We would have all shaken our heads and this mess wouldnât have happened.    And because of 9/11, all these safety measures have been put up on airplanes. Oh yeah, Iâm going to take over an airplane with a razor blade. Itâll kill the pilots and Iâll rule the sky. Then Iâll crash into the field of enchanted daisies and kill everyone. âNever sacrifice freedom for security.â My best friend always says that. Itâs a quote from one of our founding fathers. A quote long forgotten. This country is hardly free, it has rules and restrictions and laws, so why make it less free? But of course, people have way too much fear; they have to get over the fact that sometimes countries are attacked. Itâll never go away as long as people are here, so donât bother, just live life as much as possible. We are restricted by our religions, the government and reality, so why restrict it even more with security? Some security is good, but donât overdo.      Political parties, everyone has them and weâre no different. We have two main parties, Republicans and Democrats. Republicans make the rich richer and the poor poorer (my family is feeling this effect) but at the same time Democrats over tax and get the government too much cash. Both have problems. We shouldnât even have political parties. It causes hatred between them, we should vote for who we want because of who we want and not the party they are in. We should have listened to George Washington when he warned us against political parties. But we arenât very good listeners. What can you do? Well, I sit back and watch, I laugh at people hating the other party. Itâs just funny how childish both sides are.    Religion is a mouthful for just one word. Look at our constitution, then take the bible and take out God. Itâs the same. Religions give us rules and restrictions, as does the government. They walk hand in hand. I have nothing against religion; I just hate how we all must belong to a religion. Why canât we just believe what we want without having to belong to a group? We use religion to be stereotypical a lot of times. Why organize? Why canât we just believe a bit of anything we want? Well, we can, but people find that âbadâ. Everyone needs a religion right? Everyone must have one. Thatâs just the way people think.   Iâm Agnostic, myself. I get a bad rap because people hate how Agnostics donât care about how the earth came into existence, and they hate how Agnostics need so much proof to believe. Some ministers, priest, reverends, ect think itâs better to be Atheist because at least most Atheists believe in something even if itâs a scientific belief. But what does it matter? Why should Agnostic even be in existence? Why canât I just believe what I want without being labeled? The fact is Agnostics are more peaceful than Atheists. Agnostics donât speak up as much or fight really. And there are so many less Agnostics than Atheists. But people find it disturbing that someone needs solid proof for everything. But Agnostics donât deny beliefs. They just donât believe in them, but they wonât deny that those beliefs may be true. Atheists deny, but Atheists speak out more. Atheists, in a sense, fight. Agnostics just sit there and let things happen because they donât care, people think itâs wrong not to care. The truth is, I really DONâT care, I donât care if you yell, âGod is the best!â because thatâs your opinion, if it makes me uncomfortable then thatâs my problem. I can deal with it. I can live with it. I can live with saying âUnder Godâ when I say the pledge of allegiance (on rare occasions because I donât like where this country is going.) The only problem I find with it is that the original creator of the pledge didnât put it in there, but Iâll get over it.   Now, as for Obesity, itâs going to come down to the fact that our government will have to control what we eat because we arenât strong-willed enough to eat well. We shouldnât have to go on diets, just make sure we donât overdo on the high fat, high calorie, and high carbohydrate foods. And we must have some sort of exercise activity. Or at least exercise somewhat. Get yourself moving. Iâm being a little hypocritical here because I stay inside all day, but I am planning on obtaining an exercise activity by taking a martial arts class. And I do move around quite a bit when Iâm not online. I walk around when listening to music; I do push-ups in the morning or at night. It doesnât have to be sports to get us moving, just something. But because we all canât control our urges, we eat âlike a dog that feeds until he suffersâ (Bad Religion, âHow much is enough?â). We must learn to be strong; we have to in order to stop the predicted future for America, one where 100% of Americans will be obese.   And then there is sex. Sex is overrated. Itâs a process of making babies, but all the movies make it seem so great, late night TV is all about it. Itâs a natural process let it go people. I donât care how much fun you have with it, Iâm only 14 and itâs all around me. Itâs in all the movies, ads, magazines, no wonder there are so many teen pregnancies. People just overdo it so much, and you can even watch it with porn movies. And weâre all taught that itâs wrong to have sex at a young age, yet all around us our movie stars are having it, and stars are idols to many people. Itâs hypocritical. You tell us not to but you do. We should stop publicizing sex, stop the porn, and focus on our lives and what we want to do and not what the world around us says is great.   I guess this means I need a conclusion. Well, the conclusion is, this country needs to do some cleaning up. But we just started out we still have time. America has been around for a little more than 200 years. Thatâs not a lot compared to the thousands of years that Christians claim this world to be, and its really not a lot compared to the billions of years old the scientists claim this world to be. We must watch out, however. We cannot make too many mistakes, and we must continue to realize that the government is not our friend, it is too be feared. Big Brother is watching us all, we must be careful of him. We must be ready to fight him if it becomes necessary. And we must be weary of Patriotism, too much of it can blind us from the mistakes of our country. We have to learn to stay out of other countryâs affairs uninvited. And we must concentrate on now; we should stop worrying about how this earth was made and live on it. And we shouldnât worry about how itâs going to end. Letâs just concentrate on living our lives, because life is short. Death comes fast. But donât fear death; just meet it when it happens.   Katherine Poliquin 2004

       urlLink        Cops Disciplined for Tasering GrandmotherKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  -   Police said Friday two officers have been disciplined and department policy changed following an investigation into the officers use of a taser when arresting a 66-year-old grandmother who honked her car horn at a police cruiser. Louise Jones was arrested in June on charges of misuse of a car horn on a city street, resisting arrest and intentionally inflicting bodily harm on an officer. Her husband, Fred Jones, 74, was also arrested and charged with interfering with an arrest. Police said Louise Jones tussled with officers when they tried to give her a ticket for honking the horn. One of the officers used the taser, which is capable of issuing a 50,000-volt shock, to stun her. The officers said Fred Jones then came downstairs and jumped on one of the officers' backs. Louise Jones said she pulled away from the police when one of the officers grabbed her arm, and her husband said one of the officers had his knee on his wife's chest. As a result of an internal investigation, the department has increased the threshold for when taser use is appropriate and now requires a field commander to look into each taser deployment. Police also have developed a task force made up of community members and department personnel to look into the department's current taser-use policies. ``This was an unfortunate incident that I believe could have been avoided if there would have been a less confrontational environment,'' said Chief Richard Easley in a statement. ``Officers of this department, however, are held to a very high standard in their professional conduct, regardless of the conduct of other persons.'' Police said the investigation was delayed because Louise Jones and other witnesses declined to be interviewed by investigators, though the department did review affidavits from Jones and the witnesses that were submitted by her attorney. Police said the officers involved did cooperate in the investigation. The statement didn't indicate how the officers were disciplined.     If some granny was attacking me, I'd use the taser too. Don't know why those cops are being punished for doing something awesome like that. And if you honk at a cop car than you must be pretty damn stupid.         Btw, I would have made a link to the news story instead of posting it all here, but that area is only availible to walmart members.
