Cute n interesting fellow, really enjoyed the 3hours chat.. shared alot of stuffs together..      Suddenly gto a call from mum, told me ah boy;s feet is swollen and is on his way to see doctor..

            Wu Tian Jian Wei Ni Bu Ku Ming Tian De An Wen..Wei Ni Bian Jian Jiang Xiang Xin Ni De Yan Shen..      Used to sing this song together with me in the car..remembered the time we used to spent together rollerblading, chit chatting at east coast "The rock", our rooftop, bumper boat, haunted house, runway and our peaceful home in seletar and many more..      Got to get used to the new life now... watever is gone now will never be back.. Thank you for all the sweet memories and moments we have once shared..Whenever i look at the precious moments figurines, i will think of you..each figurine i have definetly carries some special meaning.. how m i goin to forget you..Will you still think of me when you walked past precious moments store next time?      Remembered all those songs i burned for you? I always ask you to listen to the lyrics, cos the songs says all..We shared a few "Jing Dian" like.. Wu Ding, Zhi Shao Zou De Bi Ni Zao, Yong Qi, Love Me, Wang Le Yin Chang..      Nw can only try to be "Siao Sa" and let you go..
