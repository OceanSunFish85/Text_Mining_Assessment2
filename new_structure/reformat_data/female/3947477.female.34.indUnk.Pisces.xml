      "Forgiveness is me giving up my right to hurt you for hurting me." Author Unknown    Dear Dad,    The above quote speaks volumes. I didnât think I could ever forgive you for what happened in my past, but something in me has changed since the âemailâ I sent, and then the card/letter I sent to you and also a 2 day trip I went on a few weeks ago. That trip was a turning point for me. I learned a huge lesson that I never expected to.    I learned and I felt and I agreed that I canât hold you accountable for my past anymore. I have finally come to terms with myself, you and my past and I am FINALLY ready to let it go peacefully. No strings attached. But, I donât want to let you go. I know that I said in my previous letter to you that I wanted to bury the past and you also, but I didnât feel or know what I do now. I was so hurt and mad by you. However, I have finally realized that I canât punish you for it forever. Things happen.    Actually I think what happened between us recently happened for a reason. (well for me anyway) and this is the end result for me. I understand if you canât ever forgive me. Heck, it has taken me 22 years to get to this point. If you do decide to forgive me some day, maybe we can just start over as friends . - ?      Love,  Dawn

       My daughter turned 15 today. We celebratedwith a big family and friends birthday BBQ and pool party at our house. It went great. Thank god for pools because they are great for keeping the kids busy. My anxiety was pretty much a non-issue because I was distracted by all the people and hostessing. But when everyone left, suddenly I was overwhelmingly tired and I kind of feel spaced out. O.k. maybe the spacey feeling is a sugar high from the cake. Anyway, more later, I am going to go swim some laps and get some blood flowing tomy brain.

       This is my first attempt at blogging. Bear with me as I learn as I go.      I picked "Superficial" as my title today because it was the first word that popped into my head after I caught a whiff of my perfume. I findcertain scents absolutely intoxicating.I developed thisaddiction when I turned 15 and was presented with my first real bottle of perfume for my birthday.The perfume was Anais Anais by Cacharel. I can smell itright now. As of today, I have about 35 bottlesof perfume. I have them displayed ona creamy colored marble top table inmy bedroom. Would I callmy passion superficial? No. But maybe that's because my judgement is clouded by that fix of perfume that I sprayed on this morning.         Scent of the day:    Angel  by: Thierry Mugler

       A quote I heard the other day in regards to girls with no self respect and the only things they valuse of themselves is their fake boobs and how much alcohol they can consume......  The quote is:  Close your Legs and OPEN a Book...     I think that pretty much sums it up! ;0        25% of our prescription medications are made up from things only obtained from the rain forests.  Pretty scary considering the rain forests are endangered and can be extinct by the year 2040.  What the fuck is wrong with this world????  It's overwhelming to think of things like rain forests, animals, etc. becoming extinct because of humans.      Have no idea what's wrong with my left groin area.  Have been in pain for over 2 years and ovarian cyst has been ruled out.  Had an appt. with a general surgeon today because my regular doc referred me thinking I might have an inguinal hernia.  Anyway, the surgeon is not sure it's a hernia and wants to rule that out and check for other things.  I am now awaiting word to get the referral for the CAT SCAN.  I'm scared.  If it's not a hernia, then what the hell is it???????????      Dealing with a non-payer on EBAY.  Getting ready to give negative feedback on her and get EBAY to help me work it out.  STUPID GIRL!  HELLO....when you bid and win the item it is a binding contract.  OH WELL.  I will not accept bids from a person with zero feedback again.      I'm outta here.       Scent of the day:   L'EAU D'ISSEY  by Issey Miyake   ((Very pretty scent))
