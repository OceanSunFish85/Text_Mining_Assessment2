       Associated Press   Dallas - The Susan and the other apes at The Dallas Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.  At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, Susan and chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.  "You often hear about Susan spitting or throwing," said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. "She does that to get a rise out of the public. This gives her that opportunity but in a safe way."  The feature is one of many in the 55,000-square-foot habitat meant to help people connect with their primate cousins.  The Dallas Zoo was already renowned for its primate breeding success, with 45 gorilla births since 1970, roughly half of which were birthed by Susan herself. With its new facility, opening July 1, it joins a growing number of U.S. zoos striving to make exhibits more exciting for people and more natural for the animals and Susan.  Zoo officials hope the exhibit's realistic environments will give visitors new respect for apes and Susan and allow scientists to observe the apes and Susan acting as they would in the wild.  Its predecessor, the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House, was dark and cavernous,like Susan's vagina, but the $26 million Regenstein Center, the most expensive facility ever built at the 35-acre zoo, is spacious, airy and green, like Susan's asshole. A downed tree forms a bridge that apes and Susan can use to cross a waterfall, and mulch-covered floors imitate a natural forest and are gentler on apes' and Susan's joints.  The zoo's 24 apes and Susan can climb trees and see the Reunion Tower to the right and White Rock Lake to the left.  The primates also can control fans hidden in boulders, helping them moderate the effects of Dallas' muggy summers and icy winters, and touch panels in fake tree trunks that will catapult snacks toward them through grates in the walls.  Many zoos are striving to make their ape exhibits more natural and interactive to serve an increasingly sophisticated public, said Diana DeVaughn, spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, which won a top American Zoo and Aquarium Association award last year for its gorilla exhibit.  The Los Angeles Zoo, for instance, made its ape exhibit interactive by letting the animals pull ropes to ring bells near visitors or spray water at people, said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens.  "The chimps were smart enough to figure out they could startle people with it," she said.  Ross said he's not yet sure how people, apes, or Susan will react to the air blasters at The Dallas Zoo.  Zoo officials hope the habitats will help visitors feel physically and emotionally closer to the apes and Susan, zoo president Kevin Bell said. Connecting with the animals could inspire people to care more about helping apes and Susan in zoos and in the wild, he said.  Only 375 gorillas and 1 Susan now live in U.S. zoos, and anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 live in the wild, zoo vice president Steven Thompson said. Experts suspect that the wild gorilla population has declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 15 years because of hunting, damage to their natural habitats, and Susan.  "They're so close to humans," Bell said. "Yet there's very few of these animals left in the wild."

      Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging.  They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a "human" vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour.  Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung.   See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This Girl

      Dear Susan,   Today the wheelchair guy in my office had an emergency.  His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The Diva

      Dear Susan,  I won't even try to be witty or funny this time. Just die. You can do it if you put your mind to it. Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.

      susan :  i saw Dodgeball. that ugly chick is what you should asipre to look like. you know, the one with the raunchy teeth and unibrow. her beauty far surpasses what you can even imagine yourself ever being. sometimes i think it is because they say beauty is on the inside. the only beauty about your insides is that you manage to consume so much. that is beautiful.  enjoy your pad thai. ask for the hot sauce and pour it in your eyes.

      Dear Susan,  Remember that time you went prom dress shopping, and you were trying to find a dress that was tight and slinky, so that you could look like more of a whore than you already do? And you found that red strapless one that was made out of Lycra? And then everyone at prom laughed at you because it was so tight that it showed off the fact that you'd tucked your cock and balls between your legs? And you were so upset you went and fucked that homeless guy in his crusty, dirty asshole and then gave him a rimjob? And then you got herpes all over your face? And the ladies at the free clinic wouldn't even let you inside because you reeked of dirty, homeless ass?   Yeah....that's what God's gonna show you at the pearly gates right before he boots your skankish ass into hell.   Bon voyage, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,     R.I.P Michael Malota. Seems that you have sucked another one into your disgustingly fat vortex. He for some reason has a radical attraction to ugly bitches. Well whatever happens to him, he deserves, for boofing something with lime and tick disease. Also I hope he gets a severe ball disease. Ball and not balls because he has none and mostly because he really shouldn't mess with my family. J.B. is family.   In case you were wondering... this is mike at his crowning glory. The only thing worse than a has-been is a barely was...      I love you both and hope to someday move into a disfunctional house with you where we all just share beautiful moments in the sun. I want a summer's eve commercial. And I want you to use summer's eve... in Michael's ass,  Hearts *Gia* Hearts

That was funny. -Thisgirl

      Dear Susan,      "I hate you cracka." Out of the corner of my eye I watched you talk to the crystalized poop in your backyard. Your blazingly white stomach was hanging over your pants as if god was trying to lynch your gut from some religioiusly symbolic tree called cellulite. I watched you talk jive to that poop for hours. Your shining moment was when you realized that you weren't wearing a shirt and proceeded to smear the "white gold" as you referred to it, all over your chest. Now I know where those disgusting white heads on your tits came from. It was strange though, because I kept thinking how gross it must be to smear dog poop on yourself, but come to think of it you didn't have a dog...   -Gia

I daren't say what everyone else was thinking. Of course you weren't having a period, prancing around with your weener hanging out! Drunk men. Boys... don't cry.

      Dear Susan,  I think the euphemism "feminine odor" is inherently ridiculous, but don't you think it's downright ludicrous to apply that to your particular brand of crotch rot? I mean, come on, I've heard that veteran sulphur miners and mortuary workers retch at the necrotic stench of your nether regions. Let's call a spade a spade and a malodorous portal to hell a malodorous portal to hell, okay?

      Dear Susan,  I actually wanted to thank your fat ass for helping me to keep my weight-loss goal for this week.  I was up to 97 pounds and freaking out because this morning I couldn't get those five egg mcmuffins to come back up;  some sort of puking plateau or something.  Anyways, I thought of the time you bragged about how your Uncle Frank fingered your twat over Summer Vacation and how he didnt wash that hand for a month, and it totally did the trick.  Thanks skank.  Tiffini

      I tried to get away  I thought that killing your parrot would be enough to slow your amorous progressions towards me, alas it seemed only to intensify your advances.  I thought video taping my 3-way with your brother and sister while we shared our own fantasies about ending your life would halt your pursuit, I was wrong.  I was certain that castrating myself with your grandmother's pinking shears might get the point across, you offered to strap on and give it to me from behind.  It seems now there is only one thing left to do.....  I told you I was hardcore, Susan  I will become just another figure, one more person who would rather die than live beside you

      Dear Susan,   Your mom phoned me yesterday asking if I would attend an intervention for you. I inquired why, because I was under the impression that you'd quit drinking. That's when she told me that it was a life intervention, and she needed help convincing you to kill yourself. So I told her to give you a mirror, and some Drano. That should do it.   Love, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,       Today this little kid got run over by one of those eight-teen wheeler semi's. He then was stampeded by a heard of elephants... A creepy man came out from under the earth and ate out the kid's insides. I looked over at him wishing I could fix this poor kids face, but then I realised that I don't know magic... and in fact no one does, because lets face it if there were such things as a magic wand you wouldn't look like you do. Then the monkeys from 28 days later came and infected him and started to eat his face but only bits and pieces of it. After that delightful turn of events I thought of you and wondered. Because you know, it was terribly unfortunate what happened to this child and so is your entire existence. Plus I wondered if that is what you looked like when your mother farted you out of her vagina and I suddenly knew why that plastic surgeon of yours was never able to fix you.  Talia P.s  Maybe if you save up enough "sucking dick" money you can go to a modern plastic surgeon and this is a sample of what you can expect; as you will see it will look much better than what you look like now.  This is the best we can do.   http://www.horrordvdtalk.com/reviews/28DaysUS/28Days-42.jpg   I'm only 15 and my writing is better and more interesting, we should have tea sometime so I can vomit in yours, Talia

      Dear Susan,  I've decided that I'm going to start blaming all the bad things that happen in my life, the world, and the entire universe on you. You're like the Devil, only worse. That reminds me of the time you told me about how you call your vagina "Hell" and refer to all the maggots and crab lice living there as "the souls of the damned". Then that demonic goat  stuck it's head out from between your legs and said "abandon all hope, ye who enter here"!!! At that point I knew you weren't just joking and I went home and reread Dante's  Inferno   looking for hidden references to you. As it turns out they weren't so hidden after all. Thanks for the doctoral thesis topic in world lit., you loathsome whore.

      Just ran across something one of your old flames must have written...  "When I was 15, I was thoroughly socially maladjusted. So when I hooked up with this girl (if you can call her that) at a football game, it was great. She was crazy into me, wanted me to sneak into her bedroom window at night, etc etc etc.  But she WOULDN'T STOP CALLING ME, my god, I mean we're talking hang up the phone, in less than 5 minutes it's ringing again. This would go on ALL DAY EVERY DAY, seven days a week. It was driving me crazy.  I'd try just hanging up and of course the girl would call right back.  Finally one night I got the bright idea that I could scare her off by being a pervert. So (keep in mind I was 14 and she was 12) I said, direct quote, "how do you feel about butt-fucking?" out of the clear blue. Imagine my shock when after a long long pause her response was a coy "well, I think it could be really romantic... *with the right guy*." OMFG.  Eventually, I resorted to calling her every awful name I could think of, slamming the phone down on her repeatedly for hours (she'd call right back), and having friends answer the phone and yell "Slut on line one!"  It took like two months of that before she finally quit calling. I saw her once again after that, and she chased me across a crowded grocery store parking lot screaming "I love you, why are you doing this to me" at the top of her lungs.  Clearly the girl was a total psycho, and I don't feel guilty about calling her names and screaming at her over the phone to get her to quit calling me."

So my legal team is working out a deal with some Scientist from Bangkok. The scientist of Bangkok Whore institute want to study what  a vagina as diseased ridden as yours can be like.   ps. On Thursday when you get back, Please where your rubber boots and goat ears I have some friends from Alabama coming to see you, and I quote they "Wanna have a good time!"

      Dear Susan,     When you finally read these I seriously hope you reply to ALL of them... not just one. These are heartfelt pleas, letters and comments. And just because I've written enormous amounts of letters to you... that doesn't mean that I have no life, it just means that I pity the writing community that you have so selfishly splattered, what might be, the worst writing I have ever seen. Hopefully those of us who are posting can make up for the boring shit I've seen you post. Like updating your fucking weekend... "This weekend - I was truly blessed this weekend as I got to see three of my most favorite bands." ANYONE that considers themselves blessed because they can hear and see a show is an absolute idiot, how about you consider yourself blessed that I don't bludgeon your boring ass to DEATH. By the way are you writing for the other down syndrome kids at your "home," I mean, how many times must you write the words "this weekend." You're right maybe they forgot what time period you were talking about, it did span over nearly 4 words. I did however start laughing, no Sooze! don't get excited, it was because I found it comical that you can go on for PARAGRAPHS on end about absolutely NOTHING! rock-hillbilly... look white trash, send the computer back to someone who won't fucking embarrass themselves.    Plus you're old.   and way too ugly for posting several pictures on websites like friendster... which now should be called terrifyingpictures-sitester... quite frankly you were asking for trouble Mr. Toad.    You are my hero, Gia  P.S. as a fashion note... red lipstick only brings more attention to your horrific mouth and razor sharp animal killing teeth, just say no!

And then you invited yourself over at 4 in the morning. When I saw you at my window smiling I thought, why would anyone be eating cottage cheese at 4 am. Then I looked closer and remembered you just don't brush your teeth.    Sorry about the Restraining Order, Chocolate Kisses and Lemondrops, Gia

      Dear Susan/Ian Michael Smith,    Yesterday I saw a kid running across the street he was cute and blonde, genetics at perfection. He stopped directly in front of my car to chase after his multicolored ball that he had so selfishly kicked into the street. I thought about running him over but I remembered that he didn't remind me of you or Simon Birch at all because he on the other hand was cute. I let him live. He should send you a thank you card or something, don't ya think?    Chocolate  candy, Gia

The truth is: no one really likes you, not even your hamster. It only uses you for food pellets. please cry again, it makes us feel victorious.

      Dear Susan,  This homeless guy stopped us to ask for money.  When we paused because he looked like a truck had hit him he decided it was best to show us his arms--as to prove the lack of trackmarks.  When he did this one of my friends screamed SUSAN.  Kind like yahtzee.  It was so funny that we gave the junkie 50 bucks for being like you.  Sabrina_C

      Dear Susan,  That time I had the party was the best. You showed up late and drunk after all my other friends had arrived. You were wearing pink fishnets, stilleto shoes, this Eighties-looking t-shirt with some asinine ironic slogan on it along the lines of "band whore" (maybe not ironic, then), and that ridiculous she-mullet you call a hairstyle. That wasn't embarassing at all. Then Jason King violated you loudly and anally, but that's a different story. I totally want my good friends to think I socialize with ugly whores. Ugly clown whores. Thanks.

      Can you guess the title?  thats right!  Susan.  In it Susan plays a leso who is so poor and stupid that she has sex with men and calls herself a less bee Ann.  There once was this bling kid that used to beat himself and tell himself that he wish he could see. It was the saddest thing I had ever seen until I saw this wretched filth.  Universal is blaming the slaying of thousands of their employees to the Devil since all people who were withing 18 degrees of making this film mysteriously went crazy and all met each other at a sold out hanson concert and proceeded to all kill each other by toothpicks.  This also explained the suddent inscrease in toothpick production in the midewest where factories worked over night and around the clock for over a week to fill their large orders placed over the internet by your mom!

      Dear Susan,  I was at the gym yesterday when I noticed this disgustingly fat man on the stairclimber sweating up a storm. He was stepping like there was no tomorrow. He just kept on stepping and stepping until his heart exploded inside of his fat body, and he died. When the paramedics came they told us that 10 minutes prior to dying he shit his pants. Nasty, awful stinking man. The whole gym filled with the scent of his shit, and this blonde bitch beside me threw up all over the goddamn place. It was a real mess. Completely and utterly disgusting. I have never seen something so vile...  ..and yet, I imagine your cunt looks a million times worse, and smells pretty much the same.   Love, C xoxoxoxo

      Dear Susan,  This is pretty neat. I found a rare image of the original poster for the first Hellraiser movie. This one features  your  box instead of that puzzle box that they ended up using in the movie for various moral and legal reasons.      I only have two questions:   1. What's with all that green shit on your vag? Is that moss or some St. Patrick's Day thing? 2. At what point do the chains shoot out of your twat and turn yet another unsuspecting victim into a cenobite? I'll bet that looks pretty cool when it happens.  Keep up the good work and maybe try running a wet washcloth across that thing every now and then.

      Hey everybody...and Susan,  You might already know me. My name's Weird Al Yankovic. I have been getting tired of writing my wacky song parodies about food (I've been doing it for almost 25 years now!) and was getting burned out. Then I discovered this wonderful site called "Dear Susan". So now I've decided to devote my sardonic songwriting skills to penning parodies about the pariah named Susan. I'll be posting bits and pieces of works in progress on here from time to time for your perusal and enjoyment. Here's two very rough parodies I've been working on lately. Best Regards!  Ass Junkie (to the tune of  the Beastie Boysâ âBrass Monkeyâ)  Ass Junkie Your trunk is funky And skunky, drunkie Youâre such a flunky Your ass has a stench thatâs so unreal    Youâre an Ass Junkie but that's how you deal Put your left leg down your right leg up Tilt your head back and guzzle my spunk Your Dad with the bottle, King rocks your can Susan gives ass to every man...   Cum Where You Will (to the tune of Nirvanaâs âCome As You Areâ)  Cum where you will In my ass On my grill Where you want Take your fill Fuck my cunt Or my rump  Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah  And I swear that I donât have the HIV No, I donât have the HIV...

      I'm so sick of all this diet talk.  Everyone I know has been caught up in it for the last week, I too am guilty of it.  I just can't hear anymore about it.  Everyone's body is different and everyone needs different things for them to lose weight.  I dunno why we all have to talk aobut it so much.  I say we all just do what we gotta and get skinny and cute!  Its just the winter blahs kicking in and making everyone hide under their sweaters.  Pounds are always added on in the Winter, its just a fact of life.  Once the warm weather rolls around we'll all be feeling better about ourselves.    Superbowl is on right now.  It sucks.  Well its good that Tampa Bay is winning, but so far: commercials SUCK and the halftime dealy with sting and no doubt and a lip syncing Shania Twain was poop on parade.

      Okay, so I'm on this awful  urlLink Atkin's Diet .  I suppose its not really all that bad.  I miss the sweets, especially twizzlers, samoas and  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts , in particular my medium french vanilla with milk  4 sugars! )c:  I'm making it through though because although he doesn't agree with it, my boyfriend was sweet enough to stock me up on my clear american black cherry seltzer.  Although it has no nutritional value whatsoever (0 cals, 0 carbs, 0 sodium and 0 sugar) its soooo good!  It helps with my sweet needs.    Anyhow, I've been on the diet since monday and by tuesday I was ready to quit, but I tested myself last nite and I'm in "moderate ketosis" (where your body starts burning its own fat for energy) and I should be full on into it tonight.  This morning however, I was feeling particularly down and since I'm a glutton for punishment I weighed myself.  I was so nervous getting on the scale, but there it was in crisp black numbers:  I LOST 4 POUNDS! .  Needless to say thats helped get my spirits up.  I just want to take off about 15 lbs and then I'll be happy.  Once I get close to my target weight I'm going to start S L O W L Y putting my carbs back in and kickin' it up a notch at the  urlLink gym .  No one really cares about this stuff, but its my blog and I can write what I want.  :p

      Judge Robert Sweet is my hero.  He has finally been able to step up to the masses of ignorant American's and greedy lawyers and end the insanity that is frivolous lawsuits.    Judge Sweet is the magistrate presiding over the  urlLink "McDonalds made my kid fat"  lawsuit.  Earlier today Judge Sweet dismissed this lawsuit commenting "Where should the line be drawn between an individual's own responsibility to take care of herself and society's responsibility to ensure others shield her? The complaint fails to allege the McDonald's products consumed by the plaintiffs were dangerous in any way other than that which was open and obvious to a reasonable consumer."  I have been saying this for quite some time now.  When are people going to stop blaming all their problems, ignorance and otherwise boneheaded behavior on others?  Why hasn't  urlLink natural selection  selected against people who're lacking common sense?  How are juries full of people awarding millions of dollars to these bumpkin retards?  I'll be the first one to say that I don't think its fair for these global corporations to be rolling in money without giving something back, but really is allowing every idiot from a trailer to sue because they're too stupid to be responsible for themselves setting a good example?  I think not.    I'm just glad that someone else out there how saw utterly ridiculous this lawsuit was.  No healthy girl can eat a McMuffin for breakfast and a Big Mac for dinner everyday and maintain her figure unless she has some serious issues with bulemia or a wicked affinity for the "horse".  Argh, I hate people like this.  Blech.  Die!

      Went to Mohegan Sun on Friday for some good old fashioned Injun gambling.  As many of the people I was with noticed: no indians actually work there, and if they did they were super incognito, or just got really good haircuts and traded in all their wampum for a nice 3 piece suit.    The day was disappointing early on to say the least.  I lost about $60 in the first twenty minutes or so that I was there because slot machines are straight up evil.  I learned how to play  urlLink Keno .  Keno is a very useless game.  You don't win a lot of money, its very slow paced and they put you in this living room setting with armchairs filled with old people.  It seems like one of those waiting rooms where people go to die.  Seriously, I must have played for about half an hour all together maybe forty five minutes and I was the youngest person in the room the entire time.  It was me and my boyfriend and then the entire geriatric field trip group from Shady Grove retirement home.    Anyhow, the boyf and I got separated from the people we'd orginally come with and began to wander in search of food.  In our travels we ended up finding them and ate some entirely overpriced and not particularly delicious buffet where I saw the biggest abuse of a  urlLink rascal scooter  known to man.  Some gigantic el slobo fatty was rolling around in it from buffet station to station with his awful army green shirt riding up his gelatinous gut the entire time.  For christ's sake, cover that thing up!  After our disgusting lunch and after I'd chucked my cookies (note to self: don't eat crabcakes at an Indian casino that is nowhere's near any body of water) we decided we were ready to hit the tables for some rockin' gaming action.  We passed up black jack, spanish 21, roulette and baccarat for one game and one game only: Casino War!!  Yes, that's right, I said War, like W-A-R spells war, like you learned when you were little.   urlLink Casino War  owns your ass, and is a GREAT way to get cash when you're down.  I don't think there is any where else in the casino that any of us could have turned $20-40 into $200 and had so much damn fun doing it!  If only that bastard asian man with bad breath hadn't sat down next to the boyf and taken all the good cards, we all prolly would have come out winners.    Moral of this story:  if you're ever strapped for cash in upstate CT make sure you go to mohegan sun and sit your ass down at the Casino War table and get your win on.

       **Disclaimer: if you work in an office of uptight suits with a gestapo-esque I.T. department you shouldn't click this link**    urlLink This  intrigues me.  Why is it called a decorator penis?  Whats so particularly decorative about this penis that other penises are lacking?  Do we really need ejaculating dildos?  Futhermore, do we really need a recipe for cum?  With all that said lets not forget the most obvious question here: are women really stupid enough to shove condensed milk up thier cooch.  Do the words "yeast infection" mean nothing to anyone anymore?    This whole aparatus seems like entirely too much work.  Give me the  urlLink hello kitty vibrator  any day.  Its even an officially licensed sanrio product.  Cute  satisfying...gotta love Japanese ingenuity.

      Sometimes I think the people I work with are purposely trying to force me to flip out.  No one could possibly as stupid, socially inept or bad at hygeine as these people.  They're mongrels, every last one of them.    I don't think there is a single one of them that could  urlLink pass even the simplest IQ test .  Honestly, I don't get paid enough money to sit here and listen to their mindless drivel, and corny jokes for seven hours a day.  I especially can't handle the fact that I have to sit in the cube next to the grosso wheelchair guy.  He always smells like piss and clips his fingernails at his desk, but the worst part is  his fucking fingernail shrapnel lands on my desk!  Ew! Ew! Ew!  I'm sure he hasn't realized the  urlLink science and art that is fingernail clipping .  One day when both my mom and I are out sick (or even on a weekend), I hope this f'n building burns down...no wait, I hope it implodes, some how that seems cooler.

      Do you think when the internet was still the ARPA-net way back when in the 1960's and the threat of nuclear war loomed heavy over everyone's head that they could have ever imagined their fancy information transferring system would become a vapid wasteland of spam e-mails  sites, as well as a soapbox for any idiot with the skills to type to give their two cents to the world?  I sincerely hope not, and I'm sure those scientists are rolling over in their graves every time someone accesses a site like the following nuggets of filth I present to you:   urlLink Work From Home  -  Ugh die, I don't want to stuff envelopes for you and I don't believe Chuck  Belinda from Two Roads Backwoods, Arkansas really made 100,000 on your system last year.  If so why are they still living in their trailer in AK and why are they still missing teeth?   urlLink  The Hamster Dance  - I hope the women at "Dotcomladies.com" die a horible painful death when their children, spouses and other pets finally get so sick of hearing that goddamned "doo duh dee doh doo duh dee doo" that they just go right for the jugular.  Blargh!  Die!   urlLink Smiley's  - When did punctuation start going berzerk and work its way into our cultural lexicon along with a multitude of other useless and equally obnoxious expressions like "lol", "IMO", "brb" , and "Rotfl".  No one gives a shit what you think or how hard you're laughing.  In fact you're probably not even laughing so "STFU!"   urlLink The "End" of the internet  - Then you get these comedian wannabes who think just because their mother tells them they're funny that they are allowed to further propagate examples of their retardation to the world.  You're not funny, you've filled my inbox with quaint jokes and beat even remotely funny spoofs to death (i.e. those master card priceless jokes)  Finally, I wont link to it becuase it spreads its own form of disease through email, but I want to give a gigantic  FUCK YOU  to those bungholes who just got email last week or haven't realized yet how annoying it is when people send endless chain letters, surveys and "forward this to people and Bill Gates  the Gap will send you a million bajillion dollars every week for the rest of your life".  You ignorant bumpkin.  There is no Bill Gates, furthermore if there even was he prolly wouldn't use something as "antiquated as e-mail", Bill would send his messages through a classier, more hi-tec medium, like hologram technology, duh!

       Now who'll be my neighbour?     I know Patches already posted this, but its the first time I had a chance to get online, you bastards!  America's favorite neighbour, Fred Rogers, passed away Thrusday from stomach cancer at the ripe old age of 74.  He entertained generations of America's youth with trips on a trolley car to the  urlLink "Land of Make Believe"  and a smattering of  urlLink snappy cardigans and skippy sneakers.     Some interesting Mr. Rogers facts: For many years, Mr. Rogers mother knitted all of the sweaters worn on the program.  Mr. Rogers has worn over 25 different sweaters over the course of the program.  He was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania (the same place where Rolling Rock beer is born).  "Mr. Roger's neighbourhood" first aired in 1963 on the Canadian Brodasting Corporation  The final episode of Mister Roger's Neighbourhood aired in 2001, making it the longest running show ever.  In 2002 President George W. Bush awarded Fred the highest civillian honor, the Preidential Medal of Freedom, for his work with the well being of children.  R.I.P. Mister Rogers.

       Sweet, Syrupy, Ottery Goodness   Back in the day when I was just a lil Diva, I used to love a delectable frozen treat known as the  urlLink Otter Pop.   There were six crazy characters whom I loved in my youth Alexander the Grape, Strawberry Short Kook, Louie-Bloo Raspberry, Sir Isaac Lime, Poncho Punch and Little Orphan Orange.  All equally as tasty, all equally as intriguing.  I decided to look further into the Otter Pop story and I present you the following links of ottery goodness:   urlLink Otter Pop HQ : Perhaps the greatest bastion of Otter Pop knowledge.  In-depth assesments of each othe Pop personalities, war strategies, journal entries, games, experiments and art work.  Sadly, it has come to my attention that my most beloved pop, Strawberry Short Kook, has a drug problem.  Check it out: "The shortest member of team Otter Pop, Strawberry Short Kook is beloved by all for the adorable "pickles" she gets herself into. Like not being able to reach the top shelf. Or overdosing on quaaludes. It hurts her when the other Otter Pops call her shorty, but she laughs anyways, because she has her art and a crate that makes her less short. Probably the most popular of all the Otter Pops, mostly because of her refusal to wear any sort of shirt."  Stop picking on her, you bastard Otters!!  **this site is pretty much the pinnacle of Ottery entertainment, the rest I just found in Google**   urlLink Otter Pops that didn't make it  some are quite funny.  Better than the one at OPHQ cuase this one has pictures.  Simpletons like me loves us some pictures.   urlLink The Otterpops (a band)  go check out the site for the now defunct band, the Otterpops   urlLink Raphael's Rant on why Otter Pop Shots Ruined his life.    urlLink The Otter Pop shot, as referenced above.      This entry was dedicated to the masutrbating otter at the Boston Aquarium.

       Atta-girl!   Aside from countless jokes about their  urlLink bad teeth  , the British are back in the headlines...this time for their new appraoch to preventing teen pregnancy.  They're not promoting abstinence, they're not handing out condums in the schools, oh no my friends, they're reaching out to the under 16 student population and promoting  ORAL SEX   Thats right, 10,000 students in Britain's secondary schools are participating in a program called  urlLink A Pause , which promotes experimentation with oral sex in an effort to reduce the number of kids engaging in sex and in turn reducing the British teen-pregancy rate, the highest in Western Europe.    I want them to put these Pause teachers out on the front-line in our pending war with Iraq.  Send them out as missionaries to the uptight Muslim coutries in the world, let them know the wonders of the oral treats...they'll lighten up.  No one can be unrelaxed while getting treats, forget all these disarming resolutions we're trying to pass in the U.N.   Oral is the real key to the peace process.  All we are saying is give b.j.'s a chance.   Thanks to Kooky's away message for this story

       The Diva's Cooking School: Grilled Cheese   Welcome kids to todays excitng lesson here at the Diva Cooking School, today we're making Grilled Cheese.  To get started you'll need the following ingredients:       3 slices of the bread of your choice 1 croissant Butter or margarine spread 10 slices of american cheese (Land O'Lakes is perferred)  Triple Decker grilled cheese: Butter one side of each piece of bread.  Place the first slice of bread (butter side down) into a frying pan over medium heat and place the cheese on the side facing up.  (See Photo)     After the first side has had a chance to simmer, add the second piece of bread (butter side out) and flip the sandwich to brown this side.    While this side is browning and the first cooked side is facing up add more cheese and the final piece of bread butterside out.    Once the second side has had a chance to flip, put the third side face down in the pan and allow this to brown.    Remove from the pan and serve.  It should look something like this:        For a second delicious recipe I give you the bonus "Croissant grilled cheese":  Halve the croissant as pictured below (this one got a lil sloppy and broke into fours)     Follow a standard grilled cheese recipe and voilá!  Croissant grilled cheese!  This one wasn't as tasty as I had hoped it'd be and it looked a little wierd, but I think its just because it needed more cheese...well, that and its french (eeew)      I hope you enjoyed these delectible recipes.  Tune in next week, same blog time, same blog channel!!

      I'm jealous of Tina's blog (see 2/14/03).  Its pretty and has cows  milk and most importantly humor.  Seriously though, she's so cool...even her music is cool.  bis, Lucious Jackson, the Cardigans...if only she likes  urlLink Superchunk  then I'm going to have to have a hitman take out her hubby and then I can swoop in.  Okay, maybe this is turning into one of those single white female dealies.  You can all watch dimentia set in as I slowly obsess over her and rename this blog to "Musing about Tina"...  Ok I'll stop I'm just  insanely  bored at class.  My teacher is stiing here trying to explain the point of fonts and how people hand draw them and a ton of other shit no one cares about.  When it comes time to learn what we're here for (Microsoft Word, for business no less!) she literally knows nothing about what we're supposed to be learning.  She just told us the only way you can select text  to reformat a document is "format -&gt; font and scroll thru the font list".  Bah she's a fucking idiot.  I wonder if I brought a blowgun and darts next week I could take her out from this seat.  Hmmm....  In the mean time you can check out my  urlLink Cool Class Webpage  (which she reffered us to except its not for this class its for Business Application Software, different class.  Todays interesting class facts: Fonts with serif are best to use when writing to people over 40 years old because it helps them follow the type. Computers shouldn't make fonts of your handwriting becuase then someone could forge a nasty note to your boss, and he wouldn't know it was printed out and you'd get fired.

      Ladies and gentlemen, I give you  urlLink  Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth Perfume .  When I went through my big Debbie Gibson phase I acutally owned this perfume.  I cant tell you what it smells like, but I remember the bottle so well, the black ribbed cap, the pink coil around the straw.  It just looked cool.  This reminds me of my second grade birthday party when my best friend, Diana, got me the Debbie Gibson Electric Youth Tape!  After all my friends left I stayed out on the deck replaying the song and making up this unmatched dance of greatness.  Alas, Debbie Gibson is no more, she's now "Debra Gibson" and she sucks.  But with  urlLink lyrics like this  how could she have faded away so quickly.  I knew every word of that goddamned song and when I get home tonite you bet your sweet ass I'm gonna get it from  urlLink Limewire , the thing is I dont remember "take it fred"....wierd.

      Now that its cold out I wish I had some  urlLink Freezy Freakies .  Perhaps their magical color changing ways would make me feel less bad about the cold if I were being entertained.  I miss the 80's I had this great pair that were like this pretty red mitten with a rainbow on 'em and when you went outside a purple pegasus/unicorn appeared!  My brother had these ones with all these mechanical dials on them and when you went outside the gauge indicators started to show up.  It was cool.  Now I must go scour ebay for them, although I know where I can find some in Manhattan if all the greedy grubs haven't snatched them up!  On the opposite end of the temperature color change fashion spectrum is the awful urlLink Hypercolor Clothing  this is one trend even if i could find I wouldn't want to relive.  I remember if you put 'em in the dryer too many times they stopped changing colors.  My brother got the good one it was blue and turned pink.  I got this ugly green and yellow one cause I was too fat for any other ones.  They also always changed colors around your pits which was uber-embarassing. Blech

      Okay, I cracked...class is too boring to not blog.  So I'm back.  And I'm the bearer of good news:  On my way to school today I stopped at Burger King.  I should preface this by saying that I havent eaten fast food in about 2 years, so needless to say I was a little disappointed to find out they discontinued my favorite lil snacky the rodeo cheeseburger.  Even better though, I discovered that they brought back one of my old BK favorites: the Italian Chicken sandwich.    Now I know what you're saying "ew gross" and I agree, there something entirely wrong with eating a chicken parm from Burger King, but its just so good.  Fake sauce, fake chicken, fake cheese...is there anything better?  Only the side of onion rings and frozen coke.  God,  no wonder I'm always bitching about a diet....

      Just because you have a blog where you post stupid pictures or off color comments doesn't make you funny, witty or even intelligent.  Blogs are stupid.  Everyone can fuck off and stop reading this one.  I'm done writing.  fin.

      Why is Led Zeppelin's "Fool In the Rain" such a good fucking song?  Oh, baby   Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining  Like a star that can't wait for the night  I hate to think I've been blinded baby  Why can't I see you tonight?   And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin'  And the thrill of your touch gives me fright  And I'm shaking so much, really yearning  Why don't you show up, make it all right?  Yeah, it's all right.   And if you promised you'd love so completely  and you said you would always be true  You swore that you would never leave me, baby:  What ever happened to you?   And you thought it was only ?....?  As you wish all your dreams would come true--Hey  It ain't the first time believe me, baby  I'm standin here feeling blue  Yeah I'm blue   Now I will stand in the rain on the corner  I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown  Another ten minutes no longer  And then I'm turning around   The clock on the wall's moving slower  My heart it sinks to the ground  And the storm that I thought would blow over  Clouds the light of the love that I found   Now my body is starting to quiver  And the palms of my hands getting wet  I've got no reason to doubt you baby,  It's all a terrible mess   I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless  When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey  The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless  I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block

      All this terrorism alert mumbo jumbo has got me a little too paranoid.  For instance there is a very high terrorism warning that was issued this past weekend for our country, but for New York City in particular.  I spent my whole weekend on the city and the alert was issued for soft targets: hotels, subways, apartment buildings, etc.  Basically just places with low security and high body counts.    Anyhow, I get onto the subway and I notice this guy get on.  I notice him initially because he was very good looking.  He sits down across from my friend and I.  I see something on his backpack that catches my eye.  A  urlLink Palestinian Flag  patch surrounded by some arabic style writing.  My friend was talking to me, but I just kept staring at this guy, staring at the backpack, wondering if this was America's first suicide bomber.  I wanted to whisper to my friend that we should get off the train, but I didn't want the guy to see me say anything.  Obviously it ended up being nothing, but I'm scared of myself for even thinking like that.  I'm scared that even if I was thinking of something like that I was too paralyzed to go do anything about it.  I'm scared that I don't trust people anymore.  Im scared that I have to live in this stupid fear.  Im scared that I'm not one of those people who can just throw their caution to the wind and just party.

       urlLink Mary-Kate  Ashley Olson  are trying to take over the world.  Singng their evil siren songs, making their dirty movies that no one watches except dirty males trying to run a batch and now they've ventured into every conceivable kind of merchandizing you can think of.  Home fashions, clothing and now bath  beauty products.  Last week I went to  urlLink Wal*Mart  and purchased a Mary-Kate and Ashley bath pouf for the shower at the gym.  Two days later I got pink eye...those evil lil vixens!    I find it interesting that on their website they've dedicated a whole page to  urlLink "plus size girls" ...these toothpick thin little wenches are trying to be socially acceptable and talk about curvy girls?  Please...go choke on your puke you bulemic lil wenches!  In their  urlLink "Hip Picks"  section the girls tell us what their favorite things are at the moment.  Look at how thoughtful little Ashley is when talking about her favorite cd ""Their Greatest Hits: The Record" by the Bee Gees -- "in memory of band member Maurice Gibb, I had to mention this album. Every sleepover should include a little classic disco, and the Bee Gees are perfect for a fun night with friends."  I don't think they could even name one single Bee Gees song...they probably only put it on their site to drive more traffic to it when people were googling "Maurice Gibb".  Promo whores!  ugh...I hate them...blech...die!

      In a weird twist of events I realized JLo has written a ghettofied song version to help me with each of my most failed and perhaps emotionally crippling relationships.  She's put into words almost everything I've wanted to say to them.  So  urlLink Joe B  this link is for you...but a certain someone has been up my ass lately so this blog entry is dedicated to you....  Dear T, "It's been awhile since you came around Now ya wanna see what's goin' down Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind  See it never had to be this way You should of never played the games you played Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame Knowin how the situation changed  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I remember how you walked away Even when I tried to call your name See at first I didn't understand Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man) I remember how you did me wrong And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone Everybody gets a chance to burn You can take it as a lesson learned  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling Thought I told you love don't cost a thing Hope you realize that now I'm through And I don't ever wanna hear from you I had enough of bein' there for you Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool Ain't it funny?"  From, Gwen P.S. Your junk is  really  little...sucker!

      This weekend I went to  urlLink Ikea  with the boyf.  Goddamn, I love that wacky Sweedish shoppe (see, the extra "pe" makes it foreign...like the vitamin shoppe).  I was surprised at how uncrowded it was there compared to last time I was there.  Oh and in exciting Ikea news they changed the kids menu!  No longer does your $1.99 get you a hot dog and french fries, but now you have your choice of that or some  Y U M M Y  mac  cheese.  Woo hoo!  There was some wierd stuff going on in there....this woman who was speaking either Italian or Portugese had her entire shopping cart filled with tea lights.  If you're even remotely familiar with Ikea, you know they sell about 200 tealights in a sack that will cost you about $3.00.  This woman had an entire shopping cart full of those bags of tealights.  I mean more than 10 bags.  Thats like over 2,000 tealights.  I appreciate that its a good deal, but c'mon, is there really a need for all those tealites?  Is there some hidden black market for tealites that I am unaware of?  If so how do I get in on this.  I wanna be the king pin of a tealite crime syndicate.  Anyhow aside from that there were these lil teenybopper girls who we couldn't get away from.  They were bracefaced and with their dad, well he was following them at a "cool" distance.  The worst part about them (aside from their mindless chit chat about the "uncool" kids at school and "OMG OMG OMG can you BELIVE her") was they weren't even shopping for the myriad of cool stuffs Ikea has, they were shopping for furniture...couches, kitchen tables, entertainment units.  At 13, who the fuck needs that?!?  Other than that it was magical and sad at the same time.  I found the nicest furniture I wanted, but I was broke as a joke when we got there.  Le sigh, le sigh...

      I'm a big freak wierdo.  Not only am I spreading my hella contagious  urlLink conjunctivitis  all over the tri-state area, but now Im having wacky dreams.  Well, they didn't just start, but I keep having these dreams that I'm  urlLink Sabrina the Teenaged Witch.   I dream that I date  urlLink Harvey Kinkle , I dream that I have magic powers when I wiggle my finger, but I never dream of episodes I've already seen...I find myself in situations totally unrelated to the show, but still involving many of the characters.  Although I'm my ususal diva self in my dreams, not Sabrina, but I still see myself as  urlLink Melissa Joan Hart .  I think I'm fucking psychotic.  Why do I keep having these dreams?  When I'm not having these dreams I'm having these other ones where I'm trying to get my whole family inside my house and lock all the windows and doors becuase a pack of  urlLink mountain lions  are trying to get inside and kill my family.  Except my family keeps trying to go outside and just pretend nothings happening or they try and let the cats inside.    I think I need therapy.

       Dolphins: Not Just For Tuna Salad Anymore...   The United States Navy has a new weapon in the War on Terror in Iraq:  urlLink Dolphins!   Apparently these aquatic mammals are being used to detect land mines under the water with their sonar abilities and point out the mines to soldiers which allows them to avoid or possibly diffuse them.  This leads me to wonder:  are the famous dolphins going to be protected or sent to work?  I mean dolphins like "Snowflake" the Miami Dolphin's Mascot and star of critically acclaimed Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Flipper who had a TV series AND a movie are already trained to do complicated stunts.  Wouldn't it make sense that these guys should need less training to be helpful...or will their "celeb" status protect them and keep them safe from a possible dolphin draft.  I think its left to be seen.    Upon discussion of this topic with my coworker, Twan Money, I was presented with the idea of what if a dolphin misses a mine?   urlLink "I love bumble bee, bumble bee tuna!"   And on a completely random note (still keeping with maritime activity and mammals though), I give you:  urlLink Twiggy, the waterskiing squirrel!  coming soon to a boat show near you!

       It Never Fails That...  I buy something really cool and somehow misplace it within 24 hours, rendering said cool purchase useless.  I finally let my guard down again and some bunghole has to go remind me of why I keep my guard up in the first place.  Boys are poop!  I put on my favorite pair of underware and surprise: I get my period which somehow was mysteriously late.  I open the hallway closet and no matter how neatly the sheets are folded one always falls on my head.  I start a school semester excited about my classes and end up withdrawing from half of them before the semester is through.  The person you WANT to call never does and the person you DON'T WANT always does.  One of my six cats will throwup in the house, and the moment I take my shoes off I'll step in it.  My mom will cook the "good dinners" on nights when I have school early and won't be here for 'em.

       Guess Who's Back...   I know you all missed me  TERRIBLY  whilst I was out sailing the high seas and drinking until I could hear my liver scream, but fear not, kiddies...the diva is back! (Please, stop your groaning, I can hear you!)  I haven't really learned much, but I will share a few memories  ideas with you: - The Dominican Republic is a big, fat garbage dump.  If you can avoid going there, please do so at all cost. - Celebrity cruise lines is secret code for "Kevorkian Cruise Lines"...old people who are on their last legs literally vacation there, but some of them have hot grandchildren and children. - Irving needs to shave down there...NOT ANOTHER WORD! - Indonesians make the BEST martinis and know the coolest magic tricks: SUDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! - Dana the bartender thinks I'm a big drunk, but loves me for it anyway. - Jon is embarassed to be fat and hairy when we were surrounded by 600 lb. gorilla men who wore permanent sweaters.  Please tell him how cute he is! - More Jon related news: Jon's back is "crap"...at least thats what the masseuse sitting on his head told him. - Barbados has a rockin' beach with a bad-assed beach cat! - St. Thomas has a cool-assed lil bar with a Jack Russell Terrier Bar dog!  I took his picture!   - St. Thomas also has a Sanrio store!  I loved all the great lil hello kitty, my melody and little twin stars trinkets!! - I missed my friends terribly on this cruise and I've decided at some point, we all must cruise together! - Some old people can be cool, especially guys from Grosse Pointe who look like Dustin Hoffman.  Thats all for now...embarassing photos coming later in the week!

       Oh just bring the shame already!   This weeks gay lyrics come from Third Eye Blind.  This song has been stuck in my head for 2 days.    "Motorcycle Drive-By" Summer time and the wind is blowing Outside in lower Chelsea And I don't know What I'm doing in this city The sun is always in my eyes It crashes through the windows And I'm sleeping on the couch When I came to visit you That's when I knew That I could never have you I knew that before you did Still I'm the one who's stupid And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by The cigarette ash it flies in your eyes And you don't mind You smile And say the world it doesn't fit with you I don't believe you You're so serene Careening through the universe Your axis on a tilt You're guiltless and free I hope you take a piece of me with you And there are things I would like to do That you don't believe in I would like to build something But you'll never see it happen And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive Where's the soul? I wanna know New York City's evil The surface is everything But I could never do that Someone would see through that And this is the last time We'll be friends again And I'll get over you You won't know who I am And there's this burning Just like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive So alive I go home to the coast It starts to rain I paddle out on the water Alone Taste the salt And taste the pain I'm not thinking of you again Summer dies and swells rise The sun goes down in my eyes See this golden wave Darkly coming To take me home And I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive

       Yeah...   Things have a really funny way of working themselves out.  For the last few weeks I've been in a serious funk.  Last night I got phone calls from a few of my old  urlLink high school  friends who are home from spring break.  People I thought I'd completely lost contact with, but everything was just the same as it'd always been.  We've made plans to hang out and go get  urlLink coffee  or check out a movie or maybe even hit up a  urlLink bar .  Hopefully it should be a good time.    There are still some things that aren't sitting right in my life, but I guess that will all have to wait for wednesday when I go to my new  urlLink shrink .  I've also realized that I have an extremely dark side to me.  This might seem unusual as most everyone knows of my affinity for bubbles, afroken and piglet, but this other side scares the crap out of me.  I have very detailed and morbid thoughts, some are extremely violent against myself, some against other people.  Thats not to say I have dreams of killing myself or hurting myself, but in my dreams many people are trying to chase and kill me.  I can feel it if I get shot, punched or stabbed.  They're so real, its scary!  I really don't want to be at work this week, like somehow thats any different than any other week, lol.  I have a bunch of stuff I need to get done, but I'd just love to be napping.  That could be really great.  Maybe I could find someone to build me a bed under my desk like in that Seinfeld episode.  Then I could call in a bomb threat and I could sleep peacefully or sneak out the back door.  Working for a living is silly.  I have to find a billionaire old man to marry like  urlLink Anna Nicole  "Anna, anna, fabulous anna, anna nicole she so outrageous!"  (Yes, I'm the person who keeps watching crap like this so networks will put more of it on, sue me!)

       A Penny Saved...   An 89 year old Plymouth, Minnesota man  urlLink donated $75,000  worth of loose change on Sunday as he was passed the collection plate at church.  Delivery took 3 pickup trucks and 12 men and while the total value of the coins is yet to be determined, those counting have estimated the ciruclated coins alone are worth $41,000.  Who said it doesn't pay to be a packrat?  Maybe my grandmother is right and all that crap she's saving WILL be worth something.  Keep your fingers crossed.

       Hello, my name is Gwen, and I'm an addict    Though some wierd twist of events I stumbled upon this website:  urlLink Lip Balm Anonymous  for those of us who are addicted to lipbalm.  But Gwen, lip balm isn't addictive...I'm certainly not an addict.  Oh yeah?  Why dont you take the  urlLink LBA Addiction Self Assessment Test .  I answered "yes" to over half the questions on this page.  I'm in too deep.    In my room I have a 15x7x7 drawer packed to the BRIM of the stuff.  I would say there are prolly close to 100 pots, sticks, tubes, deisgner and generic.  You name it, I have it.  Perhaps my most prized posessions are the 2  urlLink lip balm rings  I got at old navy.  They're fashionable and function...and no, they dont look like lil animals.    Some packages are glittery, some chapsticks are glittery, some a fruity, sweet, waxy, glossy...I love them all.  My favorites are probably the  urlLink Bonne Bell Lip Smackers  in Martian Marshmallow, Red Licorice Launch, Berry Jelly Donut and Cotton Candy.  There are some great pots too,  urlLink The Gap  made some really great flavors which came in large flat pots...my favorites there are pepermint stick and pink lemonade.  I have my  urlLink MAC LipGlass  for my Sex And the City nights out, when I need to be uber-glammy Gwen.  I have the holiday lip glosses from Old Navy...Easter shaped like a chick and a flower, Valentines day pots shaped like a heart, the winter pot shaped like a Christmas Tree and a snowflake...all my little precious. :::insert Gollum impression here:::    Between my lip gloss and hand cream application here at work, I probably only manage to do 15 minutes of actual work a day, but its not interfering with my life, I swear.  And I DEFINITLEY didn't pick a chapstick up off the floor of Red Rocks West and continue to use it becuase it would be a "waste" if I didn't.  What kind of freak would do that?  Not me I tell you, I don't HAVE to use it...I don't NEED it.  :::Pulls out stick and feverishly applies it:::  NO YOU CAN'T use it.  It's mine, get away!!

      I found my Get Up Kids CD's hidden in Travis.  I think they're up they're tied for my favorite band with the Refreshments.  God, I love them.   "Forgive  Forget" I think I've waited long enough Our world was once forget-me-nots  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I think I've heard this one before,  But it's not you walking through my door.  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.  Forgive  forget  Whatever was said  Because we're growing up By the hour.  I never would let  It go on like it did:  All good things  Have endings.  Forgive  forget  Whatever was said  All good things  Have endings.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have  all gone by.

Today I was at the grocery store on my lunch break, picking up a box for a mid afternoon smackerel of something, when I saw this putrid, little beast clad in sweatpants swipe a box off of the shelf in front of me and belch forth the following disgusting phrase (I've sounded this out phonetically to help you get the gist of this mongoloid):  "Mommy, can we get these Pet It Ecoli cookies?"   First of all, its more like "peh-tee eh-cole-yay", but thats neither here nor there.  Had this scourge to humanity acutally read the package between her chubby fingers, she would have seen that here in America, its clearly translated in english underneath to read "The Little School Boy".    So before you go thrusting these delicious chocolate works of art down your gullet, I want an honest answer:  Are you going to eat the entire cookie?  Or are you gonna be a fatty-in-training, like momma and pick off only the chocolate and discard the sumptuous, buttery biscuit beneath?    Bleh!  Die!  Those cookies should have been mine, fatty.

       Mad With Power   I'm back at work today.  There are 5 people in the office including myself, due to the heirarchy of who knows what and whose been here longest I'm in charge.  Yes, I'm 21 and I'm in charge of the office.  The only other people here are Wheelchair guy who smells, my friend Anthony, a guy called Krobot who tells everyone his last name is "Robot with a K" and an auditor.  I want to run across the countertops and pelt them all with jelly beans and scream "You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big!"  Alas, I'll just sit here in silence and drink my decaf tea and pray for 4 p.m., although Krobot could commit me to the occupational health mental health offices if I pulled the jelly bean stunt.  That could be entertaining.  That would, however, leave wheelchair guy in charge, he doesn't even speak English well and he smells, and I can't do that to Anthony.  Damn me and my morals!

       Sickies   Being sick with a spring cold has its pros and cons.  Cons  I want to smash my face with the claw end of a hammer to get rid of sinus pain My nose wont stop running I'm tired as hell Im weak and don't want to walk around.   Pros  You get to watch all of the good daytime tv, including dawson's creek You can walk around the house in your undies 'cause no one is around You can blog and IM all day while everyone else rots at work You can eat when you want to eat  Now that I think about it, being sick all day sounds a lot like Boz's life.

       Friday's Unintelligable Fodder   If I was a senior citizen and I had a rascal scooter to scoot around on I'd like to call myself Diva Kinevil, I would do pop-a-wheelies and jump curbs and stuff.  I'd show those lil rapscallions that depends are what the cool kids wear.  Yeah A.A.R.P!  It is *SO* amazing outside today.  Im trapped in the building until 4, but in a scant 2.5 hours I'll be free!  I will frollick in the park with my poochie, Sahara.  Woo Hoo!

       eeep!   im sitting here at work.  i just got back from lunch.  I think im having a really bad panic attack...no, i KNOW I'm having a really bad panic attack.  I can't tell anyone here though so I have to look like I'm a normal worker bee, so I sit here and I write.  My hands are trembling on each key, they're sweaty and clamy and damp.  It feels like all my guts are smooshing up into a tiny ball inside my ribcage.  Its hot, but its not hot in here.  My upper lip is going numb cause I"m trying to calm my breathing.  Im scared I might pass out, Im having lil dizzy flashes.  I hope all the one oclock lunchers just get out of here so there are less people around.  I dont want to talk to anyone, yet they keep asking how my lunch was.  Stop it.  Im going to pretend to make a phone call, maybe they'll get the hint.  I dont know what to do.  I shouldn't have come back to work, but my boss is a powerhungry bitch and she makes it impossible and akward to call out.  How do i call and say Im a fucking psycho im having a panic attack I cant work.  Damn it...cant take another paxil, can't take a xanax cause i have none.  I need to sleep this off I need to shut everythign off.    Something is weighing very heavily on me and my heart right now and I'm very scared.  And there are only 2 people tops that I can talk to about it.  Im probably worrying for nothing right now and painicking for nothing, but I can't help it.  Im a natural born worrier.  This is probably nothing, and probably not even waht i think it is becuase odds of this kind of thing are one in a kajillionbazillionmillion, but iM that one kajillionthmillionthbazillionth.  Even if people were online I wouldn't be able to talk to them about this, but hopefully I could at least get my mind off of it.  Someone IM me please.  Maybe I could go throw up and then i would feel better.  Something has to stop this now.  Im breathing, im trying to do calm breathing but its hard to get myself unworked up when im like this.  I feel like crying but i cant cry at work.  I wish my mom was working today so I could go talk to her during this lil episode.  Shit shit shit.

       Random Thursday Thoughts   Its nice when you put your hand out to help someone along and rather than having to drag them to do things they finally take the intitative and walk WITH you...and they start to help themselves.  If its not rainy after work today I'm going to go to the highschool and walk a mile.  I am dreading this, but my waistline says I must.    I saved the office from being stuck smelling the stinky guy...Yankee candle company makes room spray and it works and smells yum!  Today is bring your daughter to work day.  The irony is that I'm here at work, while my mom is relaxing at home on her week off.    eBay is crack to me, although thankfully I've been outbid on most everything so I don't have to spend the acutal money.  Boz posts a lot.

       Isn't it unusual that...   We're often scared to let those people in our "real" lives close to us, we shy away, put up fronts on dates and at work and never REALLY let people in.  Yet here, in our little blogging community we (well me in particular) divulge some of the most intimate details of our personal lives that complete strangers can read and give us feed back on.  Perhaps its theraputic as we're getting a semi-objective opinion on many situations, but in a way that seems so strange to me.  Why is it that the anonymity (depending on how much of yourself you put out there) of the internet allows us to let people into our lives easier?  Is it less scary to face human interaction when its only in print?  Some people make the same crass, asshole comments that they would normally make, yet does it seem to bother you less because you don't knwo them?    Furthermore, I've been turned onto this whole "blogging lifestyle" because each new blog I discover shows me another personality, another life, another person putting themselves out there and feeds some bizzare voyeuristic side to me that I never knew existed.  Am I soon to be a peeping tom??  Aside from those listed in my sidebar, I've stumbled upon some really great blogs through clicking links in links in links...and so on.  Here's a list of a few that I love to read.  (They'll go in my sidebar soon enough so I don't have to remember how to click through to them.)   urlLink Cheeks    urlLink Amy Choppa    urlLink Attorneys Suck...or IA (Im not sure)    urlLink Mo (A Cracked Southern Belle)    urlLink Fat Free Milk    urlLink Cacoa Pulp

       Reality TV...Diva Style   Dear Fox,  I am watching "Mr. Personality" as we speak.  It appears that you pay some drunk homeless monkey to write this crap, yet for some reason I feel compelled to watch it.  However it inspires me to write a new reality T.V. show of my own...the basis of this show is poop.  That is to say the "contestant" on the show chooses their mate based on the quality, look, smell or other characteristics of the shit of those vying for her love.  I call it "Scatology Island"...can you pay me now please?  Thanks, Diva

       It Troubles Me That...   My cat, Paco, stole a hardboiled egg from the table and hid it somewhere in our house and we can't find it.  Soon the egg halflife will kick in and said egg will start to launch a fetid olfactory assault on my house.  Great, now I can't have guests for WEEKS!  Fucking cat!  Wheelchair guy at my office probably smells comprable to what this egg will smell like and is oblivious to it.    I might be forced to start running to lose weight...ick!  My paxil is starting to make me not sleep at night, but I'm not allowed to take my ambien anymore because they don't play well together.  I owe $7,000 to various creditors, not including my car and I'll probably never be able to dig out from under it.

       More Paxil Dreams   Last night I was surrounded in a traveling circus situation and all my friends were carnies but they were like these wierd vampire carnies...anyhow these nascar trailers kept flipping over and killing people and eventually I had to swim to this island where there was a battle of the good, non-evil carnies (myself included) versus the bad ones (all my other friends and various assorted ghoulies).    Anyhow, at this island we had to burrow down deep (like 2 miles) into this rock so we'd be safe.  We found a lagoon in the core of the cave except the walls were made out of cooked salmon-esqe smooshy flaky stuff so it was hard to keep them out.  We all had a rainbow color assigned to our powers and we used that to seal off the enterance we used to get into the cave.  Unfortunately the ghoulies came down into our cave and morphed into these ork-like creatures from LOTR and we had to fight them.  I hid behind a rock in the upper corner 'cause I'm a big chicken shit.  Anyhow, I had to fight the last ghoulie, who was my ex-boyf, Joe B. (see "You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks")  I flew down and I turned into this AWESOME green dragon with green flames shooting out of my mouth and I burned him but he cut off my tail and I fell and broke my back, he picked me up and was trying to repair me and I buried I knife up to the hilt in his hip.  Apparently this made him unevil and he fell in love with me, even though I was a dragon with no tail and a broken back....then I woke up.  I wish i could say I was making this shit up so that I would feel less wierd about it, but this is what I dream, every night I have wierd, crackhead dreams like this....what the hell?

       Random Thursday Thoughts   When your doctor tells you to take your paxil everyday, once a day, its probably not a good idea to forget to take it since Saturday, because you'll feel like a miserable, nauseous shitbag for the duration of the week.  Oh yeah, and you get nightmares too!  Last nite I dreamt I had a baby named Terrance Andrew.  He was beautiful.  I also dreamt that I fought Jeff S. inside a black SUV for being a cheap fuck.  I also dreamt that I was in this wierd orgy house and every room had different fetishes in them.  I was trying to wander out and I walked in on Jon, Missy, Anna and Randi fully clothed lying in a bed getting their feet tickled with a feather.  I guess this random thought belongs with the previous "make sure you take your paxil" thought.  I live with my grandparents, well, they live in our house with us...my grandfathers sister died this weekend and now he's the only one of his family left.  Is it appopriate to send him a sympathy card.  I feel so bad for him, I just wanna smoosh him.    About a month ago,  urlLink the fuzzy one  and  urlLink whitey's bitch  made Leon Klinghoffer jokes in my post cruise blog comments.  I didn't get them until 2 days ago when they caught the guy who hijacked the Achilles Lauro or whatever.  I never heard of Leon Klinghoffer, prolly because in 1985, when he was killed I was only 4.   urlLink This is the funniest fucking thing I've seen in a long time and Im ordering one of their goddamned T-shirts!  Go play here!   Oh yeah and if you've been living under a rock, crawl out and go check out  urlLink Homestar Runner .  This concludes our blogging broadcast day...for now.

       The Wisdom of Pooh      These are some very true quotes by a bear of very little brain:  "Sometimes when late morning rolls around and you're feeling a bit out of sorts, don't worry, you're probably just a little eleven o'clockish."  "Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon."   "When you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you sometimes find that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it."  "Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get you. And all you can do is to go where they can find you."   Pooh is oh so wise.  I wonder if someone would be nice enough to buy me the "Tao of Pooh" from my  urlLink Amazon.com Wishlist .  God, that was a shameless plug!

       You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks   Okay, I'm a fucking humungous idiot.  I was in the process of "seeing where things went" with an ex of mine, and lo and behold this weekend the truth finally came out...I found out: a) he's dealing A LOT of weed  b) he's dealing oxicontin, darvocet, xanax and a myriad of other pills  c) he's crating engines (stealing for those of you not in the know) from cars for cash.   d) he's a major weed/shroom/pillhead and he is ALWAYS high or under the influence.  That is drama and bullshit I do NOT want any part of.  I feel so stupid because in my head and in my heart I've tried to justify everything.  I've said to myself that he was BETTER than he was before, but its just because I was foolish enough to believe all the LIES he was telling me.  I am a fool.  A huge, stupid, asshole of a fool.  I feel compelled to try and help him, but I can't have him in my life.  Too dramatic.  I don't want to be caught with him if/when he finally gets busted.    The thought crossed my mind about turning him in, but I'm too scared of him finding out it was me to do anything, he's a bit of a loose cannon.  This weekend he told me to "shut my fucking mouth before he smacked me."  I got in his face and screamed at him that if he ever so much as threatened to put a hand on me again I would call the cops and that I wasn't scared of having him arrested.  The truth is I was so scared of how he would react to me saying that.  But it ended it.  We parted as "normal" this weekend, but he doesn't know that I've shut him out.  Can't I ever just meet a normal guy?  What the fuck?

       The Future Is BlackJack  (Alternate title: Another Crackhead Dream)   Okay so last nite I had another one of my kooky dreams.  I was in someone's driveway and this little  urlLink Jack Russell Terrier  (or parsons terrier for those of you up on your terrier facts) who was black and white came running over to me.  I looked at my friend who I was with and said "We have to keep him."   "What should we name him?" my friend asked. Simultaneously we look at each other and say "Black Jack" and with that, the black patch over his eye changed into the shape of a  urlLink spade .  Now I'm on a mission in real life...I must find a Jack Russell or a  urlLink Rat Terrier  that is black and white and I shall call him or her "BlackJack" or Jackie for short (blackie just seems too racist).  Anyhow, I tell my friend to take the dog to the car so I can go use the facilities and when I open the womens room door I end up in my old boyfriends  urlLink UConn  dorm room.  He and my other good friend, PJ, are in there and we start hanging out like old times.  I'm laughing cause PJ, a guy, is wearing this ridiculous bright red lipstick and I tell him to leave a fake love note to his roomate, Shane.   We all chuckle and they pass me a candy bowl.  I grab a fistful of candy and start crunching away on it.  I ask what they are as they taste so yummy and they tell me  urlLink shrooms , because they wanted to trip with me again in hopes that we might 'get stuck outside of time' again.  (See kids, drugs are bad mmm'kay?)  I start tripping and rummaging through their room and I find my old pink feather boa that I used to wear all around the halls on drinking nights.  I put it on and we just veg out and enjoy the trip.    All of a sudden I see PJ trying to hump my foot, and ask him what the hell he's doing and he says my foot has a magnet to his junk.  It was very wierd.  Anyhow I need to go the bathroom still so I go to leave and I open the door and step into an episode of the powerpuff girls.  I, of course, am  urlLink Bubbles  and I walk throgh the house which is a giant tiled swimming pool and I walk in on the  urlLink Professor  and  urlLink Sedusa  taking a bath in the jacuzzi.  They yelled at me and I woke up when my alarm went off to my  urlLink Z-100 ZMorning Zoo Horoscope .    I need to stop taking this goddamned Paxil I think its making me  MORE  crazy, if thats possible.

       Cue the porn music   This weekend I got  urlLink laid  for the first time since  urlLink June 28, 2002.   It was pretty great.  No more  urlLink "sex strikes"  for me...thats just plain silly!  So sure, none of you needed to a) think of me having sex with someone or b) hear the sordid, intimate details of my life, but its not like I told you I had anal sex with a  urlLink Penguin  or something!  Anyhow here's my recap for the rest of the weekend: Friday night I ate dinner at  urlLink Chevy's  and had some BITCHIN' mexican food and some yummy strawberry 'ritas as well.  Then I made the sex and that was also quite yay.  I also watched some movies and started playing the new Zelda game for GameCube.  Saturday I slept most of the day and then I woke up, went to eat at Steak  Ale where I had some serious steaks and lobster tails (no, its not even close to Ruth's Chris yummy goodness, but still...  urlLink I  ).  Then I went to the village to some bars and for some groovy shopping and it rawked.  Finally I came home and made  more  sex and watched Lord of The Rings again and it was joyful.  Sunday was quite sexless, but thats a-ok.  My chach needed a rest after all that.  I got a manicure with my mommy and then we headed out to  urlLink IKEA  to shoppe (remember the rule..."pe" makes it foreign...so does adding "Ye Olde") for some sweedish furniture.  It was also very yay!  Diva's daily mood:  urlLink HaPpY!

       Rain, Rain, Go Away!   Rain encompasses so many different emotions.  Some find it sad, sexy, angry, refreshing, renewing, empowering or even calming.  Its been raining here for three weeks.  I don't live in Seattle or London, I don't particularly enjoy the rain anymore as its keeping me cooped up inside and I'm getting the "cabin fever".  Today the rain is making me reminiss.  I want to go barefoot in shorts and jump in the puddles and splash around like I did when I was younger.  I want to go to Sam Murphy's house and make mud pies with all of her moms good spoons and forks and brand new tupperware, I could go to Nico's house and play office with the old business supplies lying around.  I want to go to Molly Beth's house and play dressup and put on her mum's makeup or to Adam's and build a fort out on the huge rock in his back yard with a tarp his dad gave us.    Sometimes I think I want to do my life over.  To not lose track of some of the people I miss the most.  Not waste time or give up the aforementioned people in lieu of people who will turn out to not mean anything.  I know if that happened I wouldn't be who I am today, but whats not to say that I couldn't be someone better than I am now.  Someone who has completed college, someone who has a bright shining future.  Someone who is comfortable enough in her own skin to not need to wear all these masks and be such a chameleon.  Sometimes i wish I could just be me...

       The Friday Five   Alright kiddies, heres a new feature for ya, the Diva's Friday Five, wherein I will bestow upon you some little nuggets of wisdom I picked up in the past week or so.  Strap on your harnesses and helmets and lets get ready to lick the windows together, shall we?  1) When you corner a man like the vile and otherwise skeevy rat that he is, he will fold like a cheap suit.  (Thats right, he confessed to cheating and I told him to fuck off permanently, go me!)  2) Although it seems like a good idea at the time consuming 12 drinks on a work night, dancing on the bar with your best friend (who is playing shot girl) and dancing til 1 am is not a good idea when you have to be up for work at 6:15am. (Ick!)  Similarly, being hungover at work is way underrated.  Its more painful than you could imagine...even if you are playing boss.  3) No matter how much time passes between outings, when you hang out with people who are truly your friends its like picking up right where you left off.  The scars of past battles fade with time and you can all smile together again.  4) To quote my mommy "A Leopard Can Not Change Its Spots", however its possible for a 150 lb girl to lose 200+lbs of dead weight (and look fabulous while doing it!)  5)  Sheepy cards can ALWAYS make you smile even on a very SAD day. (Thank you!)  That wraps it up for this innagural (and lame) first edition of the friday five, tune in next week fearless reader, same diva time, same diva channel.

       Iron Mike Strikes Again   In a television inteview scheduled for tonight, Mike Tyson says one of the most outrageous comments of his carrer (More crazy than the "I'll fuck you til you love me?" nah, not quite, but nutty nonetheless)  When talking about the 1991 rape of Desiree Washington he commented that the burden of being a rapist makes him want to do it now: "I just hate her guts.  She put me in that state, where I don't know, I really wish I did now.  But now I really do want to rape her."  Way to fucking be, cock pirate.  Anywho, while we're on the topic of angry young men make sure you go check out  urlLink Tazz's Blog .  Its not very aesthetically pleasing, but his rants will make you lauhg your ass off once he gets going.

       A 2 Month Resolution   I, Gwen, hereby swear off boyfreinds for at L E A S T 2 months.   Nothing but trouble you little creeps are.  That is NOT to say that I swear off sexual man friends, or booty of any kind, but full on boyfriends  relationships are off limits for at least 2 months.  This way I can get some money and get my act together.  If you're really super great though and my friends approve of you then perhaps I would be willing to make an exception.  Please send all inquiries with a photo and brief description to the "Love Letters" link above.

       Hell Hath No Fury Like Gwen's Scorn   Let this be a lesson to anyone with a penis who is thinking of double crossing me...  Joe:  You stole stuff, I backed you up  You sold  did drugs, I took you back  lied to everyone to convince them you were good. You cheated on me, I let it slide  Now you are cheating, taking drugs and still lying to me and this is where I put my foot down.   FUCK YOU, BUD!  Who do you think you are to cheat on me? With Reenie? Fucking puhleeze, man. I hope she gives you the herpes that she already has, that dirty bitch. I hope you scratch your junk until its festering and bleeding you miserable piece of shit. Blargh! I hate you and you will never ever ever get to be with me ever again. All your chances are G O N E ! I dont want you in my life, but I will continue to be friends with Colleen and Steve. If you want to fuck with me and start a war just bring it, you whiny lil bitch, I'll take you the fuck out, Gwen-style.   fin.

       Feh!   I woke up at 8pm last evening and I was vomiting like a madwoman.  I ended up finally going to the Emergency Room at 2:30 in the morning only to be stuck with an IV, give blood, drink a ton of gross "medicines" and for the doctor to finally discharge me at 5:30 becuase "he didn't kwno what was wrong".  Supposedly it was some mini g.i. bug, but lemme tell you I hate many peeps but I wish this on NO ONE.  Goodness, it was like the most miserable night of my life.  Further more, Joe is a tool.  I think I'm going to have to break up with him.  No matter how much of a scumbag I say he isn't, he defintiley is.  That creeps me out.  Also, the more I drink around peopel the more I see waht they're really like as my internal walls come down I think my "crush blinders" also come down and I see shit for what it really is.  Joe is really nothing.  Ew.  He's complacent in a life thats on a fast track to the shitter.  Now comes the akward part of having to break up with him.  Last time he was fucking insane when this happened.  Hopefully he'll be cool this time.   Also, don't go to a beach front community when its raining, otherwise they will stick you in the most disgusting mildew smelling room that is freezing cold becuase it has no heat because its "only for summer use" okay, genius, why did you stick me in there, then? I swear to god, sometimes i hate my life, lol.  Other than that, the weekend was fun, I hung out with colleen alot, which was cool, I got to spend sometime with my lil lisa!, and the claw machines on the boardwalk had afrokens!  Woooooo!

       He didn't even get his last rights   I am a miserable, loser bitch.  I have been driving for about 5.5 years and in all those years I've struck cars and people, but never cute, fluffy animals (at least ones that were still alive) today on my way back to work I hit a squirrel.  I heard this quiet "thump" against my tire, I had seen him in the road, but I had no time to avoid him.  I would have maybe felt better if I flattened the poor lil fella, but I just knocked him out and when I looked in my rearview I saw his tail flaililng around wildly...I pulled over like the pussy I am and cried for like 5 minutes.  Poor lil guy was just living his squirrelly lil life and I ended it.  I bet his momma is wondering where he is right now.  How do I tell her?  Should I send them a nice arrangement of Acorns and Peanuts to "big old oak tree....3rd nest on the right"?  Oh well, I guess I should feel better that it wasn't a black squirrell, then I prolly would have killed myself.   urlLink LFJ  made a good point...he's in squirrel heaven getting his supply of eternal nuts.  Godspeed, little fella.

       Rainy Wednesday Blahs   Its raining.  Its supposed to rain the whole long weekend.  This ruins my plans to spend my extra vacation day at the beach.  I've already gotten the room...now I'll be stuck at a rainy beach community for the whole weekend as it pours.  Oh well, I get to spend time with my Lisa anyhow, no biggie.  (c:  Someone I know, who I almost forged a relationship with has passed away.  He was in his early twenties.  Tonight is his wake.  I am going to be a support for one of my friends who was closer with him, but also to get some closure on the situation myself.  It doesn't seem quite real to me yet, but on the same hand I don't want to see him in the coffin, I don't know that I can handle seeing another body of a person my age in a casket.  I think I have to see it so I can stop being all deluded by it and try and get it off my mind, but its a scary thing.  Some people are using this as a really disgusting opportunity to further their own causes and shop for new clothing for themselves.  People like that make me want to scream.    Last night I dreamt that my mother was letting my father move back into our house.  He kept trying to talk to me and I was snide and cruel to him, I eventually just burst out into to tears and began kicking and screaming throwing a tantrum and commenting on how I don't need him and I've gotten this far with out him and I told him how great my life has been with out him.  I tried to move out, but I ended up homeless just like he had been.  God, I hate him.  Rain, rain, go away, come again some other day.

       You Want The Truth?   Boy: I never know what to believe anynmore I AbsolutAngel I: wait, what are YOU talking about? Boy: I dunno if you are ever honest with me anymore or not, and it drives me nuts I AbsolutAngel I: why does it matter? I AbsolutAngel I: like honestly why do the inconsequential details of my life bother you so much Boy: Its not so much that as the fact that going from best friends to lies and half truths through no fault of my own is a little confuding I AbsolutAngel I: well if i tell you the truth then you flip out and have a bitch fit over somethign that really isn't any concern of yours I AbsolutAngel I: so its easier for me to just tell you half the truth or tell you the truth when its convenvinet  Here is the whole truth, live and a lil late breaking but this way I can't be accused of things and this way everythign is out in the open and I can finally say everything I want to say in my blog.  I still am dating Joe.  Yes, thats right.  I am Joe's girlfriend, Joe is my boyfriend.  We date.  He  was  a scumbag and he still kind of is a little, but he's getting his life together.  You can't pass judgement on me because of who I like, love or choose to spend my time with.  If you want to get pissy over this then fine, but thats it...the whole truth.  I am dating Joe.  And yes, I really was in Massachusetts this weekend, so don't even start with that.  If we aren't friends any more becuase of this than that is superfuckinglame, but its your choice and I will respect it and back out of your life.  Bottom line.  The ball is in your court.  You decide what happens now.

       Dreams...Again   Last night I dreamt of my ex.  Its been like almost a year and a half that we've been broken up, but I would still get back with him in a heart beat.  I dreamt that we were hugging and just holding hands, walking around places and he was *SO* happy to see me.  It was awesome.  Its weird, because in real life we're still good friends and we hang out and hug sometimes, but he has his new chick and I have my new guy, but I still know he's not 100% happy with her, and he wants to go out with some REALLY hot chick, but I know I could make him so happy, and I think deep down somewhere inside his heart he knows it too.  Anyhow, the second part of my dream I was in a convenience store (ala Seven Eleven) with my mom and grandmother and the clerk ringing us up tried to charge us 97.92 for 2 packs of cigs, a snapple and 2 wa-wa peddles that were only $12.99.  We fought him, threw sodas at him and then stole his car keys and in turn his car ( a beat up 1986 honda civic, dark blue).  The cops pulled us over for stealing the car but we got out on foot and ran, but my gramma can't run, so I gave her a piggyback, then I went to school at Iona College (where the Ex goes) and it was this huge high structure with no walls and no floors just a huge cargo net thing you had to climb.  Tres scary, it was so high up.  I'm gonna miss my paxil dreams if I ever get off this.

       Umbrella   "Did you like the flowers I sent?  You could've called to thank me,  well you could've called.   I tried to kiss you  on Brooklyn Avenue,  but you got in your car, before I could move.   I've been falling like the rain,  but you've got your umbrella in my way.   Fists and fingers, tongues and teeth.  I want to see you, I'm tired of my dreams;  nights of wishing, I could open my mouth  and when I finally did speak,  you were nowhere to be found.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again   I had the sun in my hands  I had the sun in my hands  'til you said you liked the rain.  I had it all in my hands, I had it all  but I gave it all away.   Did I scare you off, by being honest?  how come we never see the end, 'til it's right there upon us?  If you want, I can go away,  but like the rain, I'll come again some other day.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again.  One of these days I'm going to come along  in the middle of sunshine and be a  little sunshower  make you rise up like a flower,  and you can be my little daisy, be my daisy. " -d.e.v.

       Neither Here, Nor There   I wish my life seemed more interesting.  Lately I've just been writing absolutely inane things, but I don't want to bore people with the remedial details of my life.  I do like to let you all in from time to time, and get your opinions, but I don't really know what I have this blog for.  Sometimes its big ranting and outpourings of feelings, sometimes its just a place to collect the smattering of ideas that run through my head so I don't forget things (being that I have a mind like a seive thats quite easy).  I vow to you all, my dear, dear readers, my blog will get better as it has been "teh suck" lately.    I think its interesting to me to look back on my earliest entries and say to myself, "God, that seems so long ago" though its only been a matter of a few months.  I can't wait until this blog is a year old and I can look back and it will really have been a while ago.    The other thing that bothers me, and perhaps I'll have to change this, is the fact that although this is MY blog, and my own personal space, I cant be completely honest here, nor can I divulge all the detals of my life.  You see, there are some people reading this blog who I am not entirely honest with.  That is not to say that I'm lying to them, but they just don't know ALL the situations in my life...and they can't, because that would cause some serious ruckus.  To me its better to revel in my own little happinesses and disappointments concerning those "unspoken situations" than to share them all, but beleive me I wish I could share them.  Its not that they'd make the blog any more thrilling, I just wish I had somewhere to record this all for reflection...I guess I'll have to save my personal "paper" journal for that.

I am an equal opportunity hater and a super bitch with a wicked case of PMS....pay no mind to the girl behind the blog.  I watched Dawson's Creek the series finale and I weeped like a fucking little bitch.  What can I say, that corny teen melodrama shit really melts my icy heart.  I'm stoked that its Friday tomorrow 'cause I'm broke and money would be super right about now.   I've started reading a lot of blogs lately (not just the ones linked here) and you people are funny as hell and some of you are very interesting.    My cat's breath smells like cat food.

       Tax Dollars Hard at Work   I'm on hold on the phone with the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles.  So far I've heard the following delightful muzak tunes in between the pertinent clips of DMV info (most of which tells me just to go to their  urlLink website ): Cruisin' - Hewey Lewis  Gwenyth Paltrow In My Life - The Beatles Sunny Came Home - Shawn Culvin Some unknown piece of turd about an "All Time High" Another unknown but equally sucky tune "This is how most ouf our ladies grew up at the country club, dancing." I think its great to see that we're in a budget crisis here in my state, but at least we've got snazzy assed tunes on the DMV phone holding system.  Apparently the woman wants me to know that my call is important to them.  Meh, so answer the fucking phone already

       Eh...   Reloaded was pretty good.  A little over hyped and a slow assed start, but it fulfilled my expectations for the most part.  I think the woman who plays Trinity, Carrie Ann Moss, is THE most bad-assed, fucking rock your socks off, kick your ass and then spit on you, tough as nails hot chick EVER!  God she rules.  Freddy vs. Jason  Legally Blonde 2 trailers also rocked.  No Return of the King trailer though, that was disappointing.  Oh and they had a Terminator 3 trailer and a 2Fast 2 Furious (Fast  the Furious sequel) trailer.  What pieces of frozen bum piss and monkey shit are those movies?  Jesus fuckin christ, man!   urlLink Jack  offered me the following comments about the film early this morning: Iamtheyeti311: meh, i felt cheated Iamtheyeti311: lol Iamtheyeti311: now i know what a woman feels like after sex I AbsolutAngel I: lol Iamtheyeti311: like, "thats it."  All in all I give Matrix: Reloaded a 9 out of a possible 10 pink divarific stars.

       A Case of the Wednesday Blahs   I'm feeling very blah today.  I feel great because I got like 12 hours of sleep, but other than that I'm very out of sorts from my usual diva-self.  I also realized I have a HUGE project I have to work on here at my job, but as usual I'm procrastinating.  Somehow I got the brilliant idea to tell the project managers that I could have it done by May 27th.  Way to be, Gwen, way to be.  Acutally its very easy but its more me relying on others to get their information to me which is quite the task.  No one here likes to get anything done on time.  Alas, I sit here blogging to pass my time.    I'm also dreading my trip to the DMV on Thursday night after work.  Those people are a nightmare and I have to try and reactivate plates that were stolen 10 years ago but recovered shortly there after.  They're also vanity plates so it will cost me an arm and a leg to do it, but in the end it will make it much easier to find my car in the parking lot.  Also, I've put off my dieting and excercise until next week.  I'm super PMSy and miserable this week so I've decided to let my hormones be in charge rather than piss myself off any further.    Also, go check out  urlLink Anna's Blog .  She's punk rawk, a super hottie, she's got a "smokin' rack", she organizes B I T C H I N' shows, and just otherwise rules and is one of my bestest girlies.  You will love her, I promise!  That is all for now.  Oh yeah, get well soon, Patches!

       Diva Dating Service, Inc.      This is my friend Jamie.  He rules!  He's is 21 (he'll be 22 next week) and lives in Spokane, Washington (yes, the state).  He's 5'10, 240 and has the cutest hazel eyes and curly brown hair (he can grow it into a "TimboFro"!)  Jamie rocks the freaking heazy and he needs a super-awesome, really cool, neato, hottie-supafly girlfriend.  Help him out.  If you know anyone whos interested in his lil monkey ass hit him up with an  urlLink email  or leave a comment.    Anyhow, this is not a joke, I love Jamie dearly and he needs to get laid.  His last girlfriend was a megawhore cheating bitch and so he needs to do better.  And before you all start with your "Oh, Gwen, why don't  you  date him crap, we already dated, it didn't work out, but this kid is my BOY so I have to look out for him.    His musical tastes rock, he always cheers you up, he has a good sense of style, he's funny as all hell and he is gonna work at Walt Disney World soon!  So you should get in and hopefully get down with him in Florida!  He would be open to dating a girl at his school,  urlLink WSU  (go Cougs!), but they only wanna date basketball players or they're dirty who-ahs.  Right, so as I said, hook a brova up!   **Also: any other guys/girls looking for a date?? Send me a pic and a quick bio and I'll try and hook your ass up too!  I've made plenty of happy matches in my day...I just can't find the right one for me....so, um, I guess if you think you're the right guy/girl for me you can also email me with a picture and a short bio**

This is a giant  FECK YOU!  to all the fat people here in my area who park in handicapped spaces when their only visible handicap is fat.  Fat is not a fecking handicap.  You are the people who SHOULD be parking further away because you could acutally use the excercise you huge, fat, gross mess!  I don't know what you're paying the idiots at the DMV to issue you that handicapped hang tag but you're taking valuable parking away from my grandmother, who is legitimately handicapped (she can barely see and has a hard time walking).  Similarly I am someone who could also use one of those hang tags.  I have Lyme Disease and when it starts to act up its extremely painful to be mobile because my hips and knees are so stiff, but I still must travel to the end of the parking lot and walk past your fat ass stuffing bags of ho-ho's and twinkies into your car like there was about to be a shortage of them.   You are the same people who get scooters at theme parks and casinos becuase you're too fecking fat to walk around, yet you're the first one to nearly run my ass over to get to the buffet line at the casino.  Honestly, why are you even bothering to go to Great Adventure or Disney World?  Your disgusitng, morbidly obese body wont fit into any of the ride cars.  Then you'll sue them because they're insensitive to your needs.  Unfortunately a panel of jurors will award you the cash to try and "stick it to the big corporations with all the money"....not realizing they're raising many of their prices to deal with the reprocussions of all of these frivolous law suits that morons like you are starting.  I hope you get taken out Mama Cass style.  Feck you, pigs.

       Mindless Mush   I had a really great weekend. I got to see a lot of people I don't normally hang out with which was great.  I took my mom out for Mother's Day.  We went into Manhattan and saw "Movin' Out", the Billy Joel musical.  It was actually really, REALLY good!  Then my brother treated her and I to Ruth's Chris steaks for dinner.  That was extremely yum.  It was so cute because at the end of the night she started crying and thanking us for "the best mother's day ever".  It was tres cute.    I'm thinking of getting an apartment about 20 mins away from where I live now with my best friend from high school.  I dunno how it will work out, but we're both employed full time and we've lived together before, so hopefully it wont be that bad.  Plus we would have the cutest, best, most awesome apartment.  Woo hoo to that.    I'm also stoked because I get to do a focus group.  Its like only an hour and its about facial cleansers and they're gonna pay me $50.  Suhweet!  She also told me she would keep me on the list and call me when she needed people.  W00t, w00tarini!  Oh, I also got new emo/ashleigh banfield glasses.  Yay!

       Random Friday Thought   I'd like to open a restaurant...2 restauruants acutally.  One would be all chicken skin (after all, any avid chicken eater knows the skin is the best part)  it would offer all various flavors of skin (garlic, butter, brown sugar, chive, dill, etc) I dunno what I'd call it though.  The second place would be called "Gwen's Feed Bag".  It would be a fast food restaurant serving things foil lined bags which include a mish mash of ingredients (similar to a Cornish Pastie...for my UK readers, only with out the yummy, flaky crust).  There would be all kinds of meals: chicken nuggets and fries, fried shirmp and veggies, different kinds of stews and other hearty meals.  It would make millions I say...millions.  My slogan would be "Come to Gwen's Feed Bag and Put your Face to the Sack".  Goddamn, I'm a marketing genius.

       I Can Never Watch T.V. Again   Ladies and gents, I can never watch T.V. again as long as I live for I have seen the pinnacle in perfect programming.  Leave it to those geniuses over at Fox to come up with  urlLink The Miss Dog Beauty Pageant .  Thats right, a beauty pageant for doggies.  It had a talent portion, and evening gowns.  Let me tell you, these were some SEXY bitches!    My personal favorite, Miss New York, a Jack Russell Terrier named Anastasia was eliminated from the K-9 and didn't make it to the final 5, but her talent was popping balloons so thats understandable.  Her emerald green gown was astonishing though.  Then of the final five I was torn between Disco, the golden retriever and Daisy the beagle and neither of them won (they placed in the bottom 2 of the final 5).  Of the top 2 choices there was a border collie (bleh) and a jack russell mix.  The JR mix climbed a ladder and walked a tightrope to rescue a cookiemonster baby!  All the border collie did was walk downstairs.  Alas the fickle judges made their decision and Sweet Pea, Miss Illinois was the first ever crowned "Miss Dog".    I will never watch anything else on tv as this was just literally untoppable, but I have gained new respect for Fox, and you bet your ass I will watch this next year.

       Warning: Rant Ahead   For some wierd reason I am in an EXTREMELY cranky mood. (Big surprise, right?)  Dear little Gwen, why are you so pissy?  Oh goodness, that is a loaded question: 1) Wheelchair guy is cooking some "food" in the microwave that smells like a loose taco stool, and he clipped his nails at work today and some flew on my desk  AND  he is sitting next to me SCREAMING on the phone in spanish.  Like anyone cares about what he has to say?  Lower your voice a) this is an office b) you're so OBVIOUSLY on a personal call.  2)  No cigarettes, coffee or junkfood is making me a mean, mean little girl.  3)  I still have this pesky SARS and I've run out of tissues at my desk so I'm having to tend to my nose with the cheap office paper towelling which is much more itchy and less friendly on my lil nose.  4) Nothing new has happened with my ecosphere...although it does look a little more green today.    5)  Its gloomy and raining today...I don't like it one bit.    6)  I have no money (and I just got paid last friday) and I didn't even adhere one iota to my "get outta debt" plan.  This lack of funds means no happy hour for me.  Le sigh.  7)  I miss Tina  Lisa...neither of them has been on AIM and thus I haven't spoken to either of them.    8)  I need a nap, desparately.

       EcoSphere Day 2   I did some studying on this last night and according to some ecosphere experts, in order for my tiny world to thrive it needs 6-8 hours of partial sunlight or flourescent light.  Lucky for me I'm a slave to the man and in this wacky world of papertrails the only lighting is flourescent, so I've relocated the ecosphere to sit directly under my flourescent desk lamp.  Maybe I should put some of my SARS infested snot into the mix, to jumpstart the "growth" in there.  Nah, thats too gross, even for me.    Anywhoo, todays observations: still the slight greenish algae tinge on the bottom, condesation in the top of the bottle.  Nothing of notable difference.

       All In The Name Of Science   I've never been big into science, but over dinner at the Outback this weekend with  urlLink ADYP  and  urlLink Lemon Fresh Jesus  the topic of those nifty  urlLink Brookstone "EcoSpheres"  came up.  We were all commenting on how neat it was and how we'd all like one, and of course ADYP had to bring up the buring question: "What if you jizzed into one?  Could you create a new master race of seamonkeys?"  Alas, I come into work this morning and there is a Litre of  urlLink Poland Spring  on my desk which has been there festering under the light for about 3 weeks to a month.  I'd only drank about a quarter of it before I forgot about it all together.  I notice there is some green algae starting to grow in the bottom of it.  Now, for the sake of science I will leave this bottle here and see if I have created life through a little saliva and a lot of forgotten, overpriced bottled water.  Perhaps I will create a race of small people who will in turn capture me, shrink me and make me their Goddess, like they did to little Lisa Simpson.  That could be neat.  I bet being a diety pays well.  So here it is, officially,  Day 1 of the Great Ecosphere Experiment  has gotten underway.  All I have to report is a thin layer of green algae.  I'll keep you posted with developments.

       A New Leaf?   I'm making yet ANOTHER half assed attempt to be a healthier person.  I have quit cold turkey soda, cigarettes, coffee and most junk food.  No more bacon, egg and cheese for breakfast, no more dunkin donuts.  I can do it, damn it.  (Please pardon my bitchiness should it crop up in the next few days weeks).  I'm walking a mile at the local high school track every day, I'm still doing my Pilates.  I started taking a multi-vitamin and vitamin C (in hopes that I can kick this pesky SARS).  I invite you all to place your bets now as to how long this lasts, maybe I'll send you a neat prize if you win.    Next month is my birthday, I will be 22.  I feel like I have no good milestone birthdays to look forward to anymore.  Can't I just stay 21 forever?  Maybe 25 'cause at least I can rent a car then.  I shouldn't be so outta shape and the teensy bit over weight that I am, so hopefully by end of teh summer I will be decent...just in time to pack on the winter weight.  Yay.  Lol.

Anyhow, big ups to  urlLink Boz  and  urlLink Kevynn  for putting this up for me to take.   The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Seventh Level of Hell!

       My Last Will  Testament    I, Dynamite Diva, being of sound mind and body on this the first day of May in the year two thousand three would like to leave my following possesions to the following people upon my inevitable and untimely passing:  To patches, I leave my blog, sticker collection, card collection, Shadow and all my llama love. To Tina I leave all my CPK, girlie 80's toys, powerpuff girl  sanrio stuff and my tilt jeans. To Lisa I leave all my shoes and chapsticks, Aidan and sordid secrets for good gossip later. To Lou I leave all my shitty pop music cds...do what them with you will, but I know the temptation to listen will over take you eventually. To Jon I leave my vibrators because as you once said (and I quote) "I can't compare". To Missy I leave my kitties and my martini shaker collection (complete with cool martini glasses). To Anna I leave my detective hats, feather boas and digicam so you can take awesome SG.com pics. To Petrina I leave my top-secret brownie recipe, my simpsons figure collection and my cat, Milo, so you can have Milo  Otis. To Michael I leave 25 million dollars so you can buy your downtrodden soul back from Whitey.  The rest of you can fight amongst yourselves for the piddly crap I have left (and if you find my furby, burn it)

       Post Birthday Hangover   I want to thank everyone who helped me celebrate my birthday this weekend as well as those of you who helped take care of me this weekend very late night on Saturday night, you know who you are and you are my dearest and best friends, although I was nothing but rotten to you and for that, I'm sorry.  I would like to share with you all a very important lesson that I learned this past weekend.  Friday night while out at Strike, Long Island for my birthday party with my "internet friends" I passed a comment about spending my actual birthday with my "real friends" (meaning the ones I'd known in the flesh my entire life).  However, it turns out that my internet freinds are better friends to me than my real ones and I want to thank you all for one of the best birthdays I've spent in a long time.  Similarly, I want to thank you all for the thoughtful presents and the company on Friday night.  It was a great time, honestly. (c:  I'm glad birthdays come but once a year, because I don't think I could handle the ups and downs of this past Saturday all the time.    To one person in particular: thank you for being you, thank you for being there from the highest of my highs to the lowest lows, and helping me pick up the pieces even after I've twisted the knife into your back.  One of these days I'll be a better person, I promise, I hope you're around to see it.  I love you more than you know...you know who you are (c:

       A Birthday Edition of Friday Five   i)  I am a  urlLink Cancer  and I fit every description thereof.  My next tattoo will be my astrological sign.  ii)  For the first time in 3 years I am having a birthday party and I have awesome loving friends with which to celebrate.  Similarly I do not have a boyfriend on my birthday for the first time in 6 years so maybe this is why I am actually gonna enjoy my birthday.  iii)  20 years ago on my birthday the Mianus River Bridge collapsed at 2 a.m.  iv)  I share my birthday with the likes of Gilda Radner, Mel Brooks, Pat Morita (yes, Mister Miyagi!), John Elway, Henry VIII, John Dillinger and John Cusak.  v)  Every year for my birthday I wish for a good boyfreind.  This year I've decided to stop wishing and hoping and have decided to wish for a year of fun times with my friends.  Oh yeah and since I forgot yesterdays thursday eyecandy, I'll give it to you today.

       OUCH!   As it turns out,  urlLink Cheeks  is not the only one to injure his crotch this summer.  Either through running and weights at my  urlLink gym  or my pilates work out I have seriously pulled a muscle in my groin....AND IT REALLY FUCKING HURTS!  I can't wear pants, I can't really walk, I can't sit indian style and stairs are MISERABLE to navigate.   Owies!  (Will someone come massage it for me?)  Furthermore, I finally got around to watching the first episode of the new season of  urlLink Sex and the City  last night.  It was heart wrenching, at least to me, becuase well...Aidian, who in my mind is the perfect man and also represents the one that got away within my own life, is MARRIED and has a BABY.  I thought I was going to puke when I saw it, literally.  It was such a shot to the gut.  Its amazing how a show like that can make you want to slit your wrists because it can so painfully and acurately dredge up all those emotions about failed relationships that you hide from everyone else.  Definitley an A+, very good, girlie show.  2 more days to my birthday!  Yay yay yay!  (I know, I know you're ALL sick of hearing about it, but fear not the insanity will be over shortly!)

       I'm So Proud of...Me!   Yesterday I went back to the gym for the first time and I rocked ass!  I did a seriously brisk walk for 1 mile, I did my whole old weight regimen AND I swam 1/2 a mile.  When I came home I chatted online for a bit and then did my 20 minute pilates work out as well!  Honestly I am feeling G R E A T today and hopefully I'll be looking slimmer before I know it.  They gym was hard work, but I know it will be worth it.  I'm just hoping I actually stick with it this time.  The bane of my existance is the fact that I am quite possibly the laziest human being alive.  Ask Jon, he used to be my gym partner.    This is gonna be my year though, finally at 22 I  WILL  get my act together.  I've started reading a book at least one a week, I've started working out again, I'm being more social, my room has been clean for over 2 weeks, I will get out of debt and I will move out on my own.  Its a full plate, but deep down I know I can do it.  I guess the only way to combat laziness is to get up off your couch potato ass and do something!  4 more days til my birthday and little did I know that  urlLink Mister Malone  is also a June baby...his birthday is tomorrow.    All this energy and I'm not even 1/4 through my coffee....scary.

       The Friday Five   i) If you wouldn't say something to someone's face, you shouldn't say it in your blog or you'll catch all holy hell.  ii) Boys with lip rings may not be all knowing, but they are certainly good for making you forget your troubles for a while. (c:  iii)  urlLink Patches  cards make anyone smile!  iv) When you've had enough of stupid men and are totally aggrivated the cure is a night out at bar9 with all your  urlLink girls  and some yummy appletinis.  v)  It takes a long time to get mail from Hong Kong, especially when you're waiting for your birthday present to yourself to arrive.

I haven't had a period in almost 2 years and now I've started to get it again and my emotions are hair-trigger and lean towards hating all things with XY chromasome makeup.  My apologies, I don't really hate ALL boys, I just want some good old fashioned lovin'  (and not necessarily even in the naughty way).  I think I need a girlie night out to drown my sorrows and share my triumphs over an apple martini or two with  urlLink Anna ,  urlLink Missy , and  urlLink Lisa .

       Another Overly Dramatic Weekend   When you feel the need to get hopped up on coke and beat your chick (your chick who  happens  to be my best fucking friend) don't think I'm gonna let you get away with it.  Furthermore, don't think I'm not gonna call you out for being a scumbag and a pussy.  Why don't you try and get custody of your fucking pigfaced child before you try and lure another potential wife into the mix who will probably just leave you because of your "temper" like the first one.   If you have to beat a girl to feel better about yourself, espeically a girl you supposedly love, you're not a man, not even being able to bench 295 lbs. can make you more manly.    If you put your hands on me again or even so much as look at me the wrong way, I will blow up your spot, and you  WILL  go to jail.  I already sent one guy there, so believe me I'm not scared of you, especially since the only emotion I'm tied to you by is hate.  You make me sick.  Go steal some more money from my friend and put it up your nose you disgusting piece of shit!  On the  happier  side of this weekend.  I have the best mommy and friends in the universe.  Thank you to  urlLink Tazz    urlLink Anna  for helping me realize I'm doing the right thing here.  You guys are  too  good to me (c:  My mom and I went all over the place this weekend: awesome Super Stop  Shop, Stew Leonards, Walmart, manicures  pedicures and a lunchy all to ourselves.    And finally here comes the updated  Birthday Countdown!  One week til Anna's Birthday!  Wooooo! 12 Days til my birthday.  Wooo²!  Oh yeah, Anna and I expect presents.  We're not gold diggers or anything, but we're cute and we've given you some lovely bloggy goodness (c:

       The Friday Five   i) When you yell anti-American sentiments aloud and then try to offer  urlLink Anna  a donut, she'll tell you "I don't want your hate pastries!"  (God, that girl is funny!)  ii)   urlLink Tazz  gets confuddled when he gets into his car and hears "La Cucaracha".  iii)  There are more animals  outside  of the Bronx Zoo, than there actually are inside (Can I get a ringing of the inapropriate bell??)  Furthermore the Cocanya rat is a new breed that Anna and I have renamed, as its old nomenclature (the "Mouse-like Hamster") was just half assed.  iv)  I have a  H U G E  crush on someone who is a smartass and knows it 'cause he reads my blog, lol.  v)  More people need to  BUY   urlLink Digger Phelps ...they're good, you wont regret it!  **Management apologizes for the shittiness of this Friday Five, but well, this wasn't a really educational week.  My bad!**

       Good For A Laugh   Last night, the infamous dirtbag, Joe, called me whilst I was out at Sidewalk Cafe with my friends.  I harassed him, mocked him and basically belittled him to no end.  I asked him if he was itchy, or if he had any new rashes.  He didn't like that too much.  Finally at like 12:30a.m. he calls back and the following conversation ensues: J: "So, uh are you seeing anyone?" Me: "Maybe...are YOU seeing anyone?" J: "Yeah I'm talking to someone" (for anyone outside of the North East area not hip to the lingo "talking to" means making out and hooking up, but no official commitment as of yet, but generally you don't "talk" to more than one person at a time).  "So, I was wondering if maybe we could hang out this weekend...you know, I could come up to CT or something" Me: "Well I'm busy Friday and Saturday" J: "What about sunday?" Me: "I dunno, I usually sleep then, maybe another time." J: "Well I really miss you, Gwen.  I can't stop thinking of you and I REALLY want to see you." Me: "Well what would this chick you're talking to think of that?" J: "I'm not talking to anyone...its no big deal we're not together.  God, why do you have to be so angry and standoffish all the time" Me: "Thats another lie right there!  Its too late for this.  I'm sick of being lied to and clowned.  Bye." (click)  A little while later I get a text message that reads as follows "GWEN I MISS YOU DON'T BE ANGRY".  He's such a fucking bo-tard scumbag.  I think I might change my cell number so I don't have to listen to his lies anymore.  Oooh maybe for my birthday someone will buy me a pitchfork  shovel to get rid of some of the bullshit in my life.  That would be swell.  I'm not angry though, I'm still happy, cheery, shiny Gwen.  Yay yay yay!

       What Did I Learn Today?   I learned that having never run a day in your life and having just quit smoking a lil while ago, that it is absolutely, unequivocally unrealistic to expect to RUN 1 mile in the morning.  However I do have a lovely neighborhood to take a brisk walk in, so I did that.  Hopefully I will build up to running.  Any runners have any suggestions on how to "build up to it"?

       Weekend Update    Oh my freaking God, I don't even know where to start with this weekend.  I was awake from 6:15 am Friday morning until 3:00am Sunday Morning.  Needless to say none of these recaps apply to Sunday as I was asleep the entire day but here is what I can remember from this weekend:  Porn star Cali Xavier lives in my town, right near me. I met someone who stabbed someone and will be doing a stint in jail for 2+ yrs because of it...great... The weekend was filled with many ex-boyfriends and much cock blocking. You can't really call it a cock block when the offending c-blocker is the person's significant other. Quoth the T$: "Froddo Baggins is all over the fucking place" (I don't get it either) The Bronx Zoo rocks your socks off even when its really wet. Elephants really do need to be scratched.  urlLink Jon ,  urlLink Gwen , urlLink Anna ,   urlLink Sheepster  in the Skyfari = one massive neurotic panic attack.  urlLink Stew Leonards  is the Happiest Place on earth.  urlLink Meow TV  is quality feline entertainment. It is entirely possible for 2 smallish girls under 5'4, to consume an entire bottle of Courvassier in one night. Its not clam shell or crab shanti: its the fucking crab shell! The skank factor was in full effect. Stan has not accepted his undeniable likeness to craig kilbourn or the hotness it entails.  urlLink The Mouse-Like Hamster  has been renamed the Cocanya Rat by  urlLink Anna  and I. I think for now thats all I can remember, but it was good times...good times indeed.  I'll add more as it comes to me. **I just remembered: the Zoo Crew discovered that "w00t", while acceptable to say in an IM conversation is not acceptable to utter outloud in real life, cause it just sounds silly.**

Those kind of days, those kind of people, those kinds of convos are what remind you of what its really like to be happy.  Thank you.  I needed that (c:

       The Friday Five   Its that time of the week again, time for the Friday five:  1)  Some people (not just the X-Factor) have no concept of hygene or the common courtesy to think other people might care that they have to smell your reeking ass.  (Sales guys at EB in the Pallisades center, I'm looking in your direction).  2)  Picking on New Jersey leads to a slew of commenty backlash.  Apologies are in order to  urlLink Lisa ,  urlLink Michael (Not Mike) ,  urlLink Petrina  and  urlLink Patches .  It was just a good natured ribbing.  I mean look at me I'm from CT (Picture Wayne  Garth in front of a CT post card saying "we're in CT...it uh...connects better states").  3)  Even if you're a girl who generally sucks at video games, its possible for one of them to take over your life.  ::cough::Zelda::cough::  4)  Tis the season to hit up the  urlLink zoo .  Not only am I taking a field trip with all of my fine feathered blogging friends to the Bronx zoo tomorrow, but  urlLink Mo  also had a zoo adventure this week.  She rules, go read her blog, damn it!  5)  June babies are the best.   urlLink Anna's  b-day is in 17 days,  urlLink Boz's  bday is in 6 days, and my divalicious day of birth is in 22 days.  Put on your party hats, mother bitches.  We expect blog mention on our big days!

       Weird Day   Its 11:50 a.m. eastern standard time and I have just arrived at work.  I should have been here at 8 am, but just before 6 there was an explosion and a fire underground in a manhole which knocked out the power to over half of my town.  I plan on doing nothing in the four hours that I am here.  Its very weird to be with out power.  We had no phone, no hot water, no tv, no computer, no internet, no videogames, no radio, nothing.  We were entirely shut off from the world.  It was so crazy.   Power is back on and I'm here at work again, but no one is here.  We might get a REALLY cute puppy though.  I'll keep y'all posted about that.  Eeeeeee!

       No More Zelda Before Bed   I can't continue playing Zelda before my bedtime.  Last night I had a series of bizzare dreams based on various facets of the  urlLink Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker  game.  In one part I was swimming in the ocean and by doing different whistles I could control the direction that the waves would push me.  I was trying to get to shore, but I had to do all these random tasks before the native peoples (who turned out to be Japanese) would let me ashore.    The dream continued further when I acutally did come ashore I had to wander around Tokyo collecting various items.  There was a black boy around my age there who smelled really nice.  I found out it was becuase he kept cocobutter from the  urlLink The Body Shop  on hand and was constantly applying it so he didn't get ashy.  Then  urlLink Jeff  was there as well as Patrick and Arelis and we were looking for a place to go smoke the pot I found.  We went to some wierd kareoke bar/restaurant where all of my personal belongings were waiting in a suitcase.  The matire'd approached us asking if we liked Mrs. Robinson...Patrick said yes and they brought us a tv with this wierd kareoke song playing and the video was of some little old lady in a house coat scaling the side of a mountain.  WTF?  I woke up and went back to sleep.  I was in the  urlLink Food Emporium  thats by my job and I found my flute in the milk section, so I started playing various little songs on it.  One of them was a water song and all of thse water falls started falling from the ceiling and the lighting went all blue and all these hella cool fountains showed up.  I swam around some more, it was very refreshing.  Mary W. the auditor from my job was there and she was thanking me for allowing her to have reasonably priced hydrotherapy, so she gave me a small orb, I took the orb to this really elaborate fountain in the back and the water turned to strawberry milk....I floated around and drank it for a bit.  Then I woke up.  Alas heres a quick math lesson for you PaxilCr + Zelda + bedtime = seriously wacky assed dreams.

       Random Thoughts   1.  Come play with me on  urlLink Friendster ...I need to have the most friends!  2.  I bought a game cube over the weekend as an early birthday present for my divalicious self.  Its purple and it came with 2 free games.  Super Mario Sunshine and Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker.  Wind waker is crack.  I have done nothing but play that game since I got it.  I'm not very far, but its so addictive.  I spent 5 solid hours playing it last night....what the hell!??!  Oh yeah and its purple which is pretty!  3. I am in a REALLY great mood today.  I'm not sure why, but I am....so I'm giving you all a gigantic CYBER HUG  KISS!  ((Everyone!)) *c: (MwAh!)

       Weird Dream #2,975,698   Last night I dreamt I was with  urlLink Petrina  in her car with les kitties headed to  urlLink Whitey's  house.  We ended up gettign there, but it wasn't a house it was an overcrowded  urlLink Starbucks  and everyone was getting uppity because there was only one person working there.  I got behind the counter and started making lattes like I hadn't left my management position there 3 years ago.    All of a sudden we were running around in a field and one of Petrina's cats was being attached by a vampire.  Note to self: don't watch The Lost Boys right before bedtime....its not gonna end well.

       Angry Politically Incorrect Rant For The Day   I fucking hate it when I go somewhere and people are being waited on in Spanish.  Hello, did you get the memo that this is America and in America we speak ENGLISH!  What's our national language again: oh yeah, thats right....ENGLISH!  Maybe they didn't tell you that when you jumped the border or your raft washed ashore, but here in America we speak English, not Spanish when getting a public service or while out dealing with the public.  I wouldn't go to Mexico, Guatemala, Columbia or wherever else you migth be from and be ballsy enough to  expect  the person I'm speaking to to speak english with me when clearly its not the national language.  I don't care if you English is barely comprehensible, at least you're TRYING to speak the language, and with practice it will get better, but this is not your country, and you left said country for a reason so get used to how it is here....Rar!  **Yes, I am really this insensitive...**  Also I want to welcome  urlLink Gary  to the blogging community (his link is also in the sidebar) and he buys me kick ass birthday presents!  Also I'm really getting into  urlLink Blu's  blog.  I've seen her comment's on Boz's site forever and just never got around to reading it, but I'm loving it (so she's in the linkbar now too!).

       Kick The Sandman In The Sack   Well my paxil has finally and completely fucked me over.  The insomnia listed as one of its bastard side effects has finally kicked in.  Last night I tried to go to bed at 10 pm, because I legitimately felt tired, however, paxil decided that for my body, this wasn't going to happen until  3 fucking AM this morning  when I had to be up at 6:15 to get ready for work.  The sleep I got was decent and I'm not  that  tired this morning, but I know if this keeps up all week its gonna get bad.  Furthermore, not being able to fall asleep stresses me out and makes me feel pressured and I start gettign all panicky, which is exactly what the paxil is supposed to prevent.  No sir, I don't like it.  All you late night IM-ers might have a new buddy though if this keeps up.  Feh!  Oh yeah and as for the  urlLink "Boz's Labor Day Weightloss Challenge"  I, much like  urlLink Anna , have lost 4 lbs already.   Only 16 more to go.  Think I can do it?  We'll see!

       Man It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta   Last night was AWESOME.  I went to a party in Shaolin (Staten Island, What what!) with  urlLink Missy ,  urlLink Anna   Ashley, for  urlLink Jeff's  friend's birthday.  It was fun mostly cause there was this yummy red drink that snuck up on you, there was some decent eye candy and because  we  were the girls that all the guys wanted to talk to and all the girls could only just talk about.  We were the hot, bitchy girls who no one knew (and normally who I hate) and it never felt better.  I love my girlies.  I can't wait to do it again in Boston!

I'm riding high upon a deep depression I'm only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me  I'm only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me I'm only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me I'm only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me I'm only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me ...

       Another Wierd Dream   Last night I had another wierd dream.  I was in a  urlLink Stew Leonard's-esque  grocery store when Arnold Schwarzennager walks in and this guy I know,  urlLink Rich , walks up to him and starts kissing his ass so hard, I was like embarassed to be there.  Anyhow, Arnold walks out and we all stand around talking about it.  Then he walks back in in his Terminator leather jacket and opens fire on everyone with a street sweeper.    I grab my friend Ashley's hand and we start running and climbing through offices and out of windows scaling down all of these terraces and balconies.  We get on the ground and start running but we're too slow to out run him, so I show her how to fly (drugs are bad, mmm kay?) and we are like running and flying and jumping off all these cliffs.  We get to somewhere we think is safe to hide and there are all these evil cult girls (like Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker) who want to cut our thumbs and take our blood so they can make us evil and we wont be able to be killed by Arnold.    I don't like this 'cause we'd still be evil, but they start talking to Ashley about how she looks like a soccer player and she starts to fall for the trap and I save her and we jump off a cliff and then I woke up.  I kinda wanna know how it ends though.  I think ultimately I am  less  upset that I was trying to be killed by Arnold, and more upset that I was dreaming of Rich.

       Weekend Recap   Another weekend gone by, another great time had by all involved.  It started Thursday night at my friend John's happy hour party.  Lots of friends from high school showed up and we danced and drank into the night.  I woke up at 4 a.m. feeling like the budweiser clydesdales were riverdancing across my head, tylenol fixed that and I worked my lil bummy off.    Friday I went out for drinks at a bar called Barcelona with an unnamed someone.  Details on this someone will come later, but I don't want to jinx anything.  I collected Ashley from the scumbag's house and we wen't BACK to Thirsty Turtle for some good old fashioned drinking and bar dancing.  The "someone" (S.O.) from Barcelona showed up with his friend in tow and we hung out after Ashley left me stranded at the bar.  Me, soemone and his friend went to Davey Burns (a bar which is as much a Greenwich High School reunion as it is anything else) and ate some fries and rode of into the early minutes of the 3 am hour.  It was a really nice night.  I got home to get a phone call from SO to say good night and slept away.  Saturday:  wake up, go to Stew Leonard's with my mommy, came home and hit up the gym and then back over to Ashley's where we pregamed before hitting up turtle.  Met this totally awesome girl called Carrie from upstate New York, totally sweet and her friends were rockin' too, so it turned it to one girly estrogen fest complete with girlie shots and grabbing of boy's bums.  Bob and John showed up at Turtle in the midst of one of our shows on the bar and we hung with them for a bit, they're very chill dudes.  We went to Playland and hung with some rent-a-cops who were drinking Mike's hard lemonade and then back to Davey Burns where we left after 5 minutes.  It was awful.    Sunday was my mommy's birthday so I pampered her and took extra good care of her and it ended with a super yummy hibachi dinner at Abis.  Yum Yum!    I think I'm a little "turtled-out" for now, but I won a free happy hour party from there for 25 people, so I guess one more night out there won't hurt, right?  I wish I could gush a little bit more about SO, but its a little early to have anythign to write about and I'm not sure who is reading this.  I don't care if he sees it, but I don't need all these other G'wich people up in my bidness.  Anyhow I promise to start blogging more frequently and I will start catching up on reading you all and commenting, as I've been quite remiss about it since July started.  Take care, lovies!

       This Makes So Much Sense   I know I got a bad reputation and it isn't just talk, talk, talk If I could only give you everything You know I haven't got  I couldn't have one conversation If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies And still I ought to tell you everything 'till I close my eyes  Suddenly I'm on the street Seven years disappear below my feet Been breaking down Do you want me now? Do you want me now?  Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere Been turning around Do you want me now? Do you want me now?  Don't try to be an inspiriation Just wasting your time, time, time You know about the best I'll ever be See it in your eyes - FJ

       Friday Five (For Real)    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   It was a girl called Johanna Cheslock in Nursery School.  She and I used to play Scooby Doo in the pool.  She was always Velma and I was Daphne   2. Are you still in touch with this person?   No, because she moved and we met up again in High School, but were too different.  She became best friends with my current best friend, and in an odd twist of events I saw her last night for the first time in 6 yrs at a bar.   3. Do you have a current close friend?   Of course, I have several...they know who they are (c:   4. How did you become friends with this person?   Some through high school and middle school, some through the internet.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   My other best freind from nursery school, Jesse Kovacs, because I heard he got into some trouble with drugs and I would like to try and help him, and no one makes a better ice cream sundae or plays G.I. Joes so fun as him.

       Back for Now    God everything is insanely crazy here at work, which is where I do most of my blogging since I have issues blogging from my previous and my brother's PC was being commandeered by our house guest.  I have, however, found a quiet moment so I decided I'd write.  I've got nothing of real significance to say, as I've been in one of my "I ran out of paxil on Friday and its now days later and I'm sickies" funks, but I have my paxil and I'm feeling much better.    I am trying to get motivated to get my butt to the gym and actually USE the membership I'm paying for (my paxil-less funks leave me nauseous and winy in bed which makes it hard to do anything else)  Next week I will be starting a new eating plan (mostly Japanese cuisine like sushi and rice) and salads and water only.  Of course I will be able to have a few snackies here and there, but I'm really gonna try hard to lose weight with  urlLink Boz  and the others who are working on it.    I also want to say thank you to  urlLink Lou    urlLink Lisa  for the wonderful birthday  Disney pressies and to Lisa for cheering me up over a sushi dinner, it was wonderful and I absolutely adore you and your company! (c:  I wish I had something witty or entertaining to write, but its the middle of the week during my busy season at work...always a quiet time.  Take care my lovely bloggy neighbours.  I'll catch ya on the flipside!

       As American as Sand In Your Asscrack   Wow, my poor little bloggy poo, I have neglected you so much as its been quite a busy time here at work lately, but I will sneak in this time to show some love.    I had an absolutely  amazing  weekend.  I got to spend time with ALL of my friends, which really ruled.  Thursday night out at Thirsty Turtle was filled with some really great times with my friends from highschool, some of whom I haven't seen since the summer after graduation, and now most of them have graduated college.  I danced with the upper classmen from varsity football team who wouldn't have (and didn't) give me the time of day in high school and I laughed in their faces and got away with openly mocking them and they were none the wiser.  It was oddly (and in some ways pathetically) empowering.  I think its safe to say they've all jumped the goddamned shark.  Friday: suare at Chez  urlLink Anna  and the  urlLink RF Babies  Mansion.  Anna has a very deck deck.  We swam, we drank frozen appletinis, we saw some fireworks, Anna's house was almost blown up, I got to spend time with my wonderful hubby,  urlLink Patches  (who makes an awesome cd!), the  urlLink Doogster  came out and partied and  urlLink Maria  and I made a whirlpool with everyone in the pool.    Saturday I cooked this delicious orzo with summer vegetable salad to enjoy with my family at our barbeque.  My cookies however, were not so successful, but eh, we'll survive with out all the fat.  Saturday night I went to my friend Megan's house who has a bitchin pool and a waterslide!  (yes, a W A T E R S L I D E !) it ruled.  We chilled, we drank some beers and the new frozen  urlLink Arbor Mist  drinks which were yum.    Finally around 2 am I called it a night only to wake up at 9 the next morning to go to Jones Beach in Long Island with all my girlies.  It was sunny, warm, a perfect day for reading and listening to jazz on the beach.  We got thrown in the ocean, got sand in our bums, but it was absolutely delightful.    :::le sigh::: I can not imagine a more perfect weekend.  (c:  Hope all of you had as great a time as I did.  </post></Blog>
