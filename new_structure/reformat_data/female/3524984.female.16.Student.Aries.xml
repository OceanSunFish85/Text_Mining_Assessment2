      It sickens me to know that I am afraid of food. I can be so shallow. Lets see. Yesterday...I woke up at around noon...had a glass of water...then at around three...I had a glass of grape juice...at five...everyone was having supper so, I joined in like a huge pig...and had a salad...ugh! I went to bed at around 1:00AM. One of my aunts who is close to my "new" family came over for supper..so I really had to force myself to eat...though, the feeling of food being stuffed in your mouth, isn't really a desired one...well anyway..about that aunt of mine...can anybody say -huge-son-of-a-bitch- 10 times real fast?! She was talking to my erm "dad" since my "mum" is nowhere to be found...[though she did call me and tell me that everything was alright, and that - no she wasn't coming back...ok. I'm heart broken...and it sucks to know that you miss your own replacement mom...I'm not supossed to hate her?! Oh well...she was there for me and I am thankful for everything she and "dad" have done.] UGH! I keep going back to another subject... *coughs*becauseIdontWantToTalkAboutIT*coughs* Anyway, she was like "Tim, dear. You have to watch that freak show, you know shes going to be 6 feet under if you dont watch her...Just like that mother of hers! She calls herself a mother, she was clearly knocked up with her first child, what was it again..Michael his name was...where is he anyway Tim?! Dont tell me you dont know!" I was in such a rage, that I got up from the table, jai toute sacrÃ© on the floor and I was just fed up of her and her antics...she cant go spread bullshit somewhere else but here!? The wacko...shes such a dumbass!! Dont ask, just dont...*cries* WTF am I doing... Ugh, I called nat today...only too find out she was gone to Montreal for the week. too bad, I'm not headed there for about another couple of days. By the time I get there, she'll be back here...meh. whatever...I need someone too talk to...and, well...apart from Dee or Billy...All I have friends I've met online...But - I would only talk to one of them...and thats only if THEY started the convo...I dont want to have some kind of pity party going on..It's just the guy, he understands so much...I dont know...I just, like him alot..My dad wont stop it with the phone calls..he always says the same thing "I never meant to hit you Em. You know you're an amazing person...blah blah blah..."then the moment came..he said IT..."im sorry"...this was the perfect moment to show him how much I really didn't care and that he had lost me forever...I just said..."If only sorry could heal all the scars...If only you hadn't hit me all those times...If only..." and I hung up...and I cried for awhile...I just wanted a normal family..for once..just for once..try to see what its like...I called BELLÂ© Telephone a little later and blocked his cell phone number...his home phone..everything... SHAY- RIP JENN &amp;amp; DAVID...J'vous Aiment!

       I haven't updated lately...but...meh, things happen. Ok, so some poeple want some GRAD 2004 reviews!    Grad Day  Jess, Nat, Lucie and I all went to Jess's to go swim. Of course...I had to get all "body-consious" and not go...but whateverâ¢...After that, Jess and Lucie went to get their hair done. fun fun. Meh...I didn't get mine done...I did it myself. :D During that time. Me and Nat walked the streets and just were plain bored. Thats us though. At around 3:00 PM we went and got Nat's hair done. Her hair was nice. Great actually. But, I just went home,and was like fuck all. Der...I'm always like that...   Grad Night  Ok, supper was horrible. But I didn't mind. I had a glass of juice and some bread sticks. Ok, yes..my eating problems must stop and I know it...&gt;. Grad Party  I couldn't stay the night at Alex's. But who cares. Nat either. So there. I went to his house. He has a pool, a dog...had a campfire going. (which was awesome) Frank was there filming everyone as they came in. AWESOMENESS! I had a wonderful time then. Just to be with my class, was enough.   The Morning After  Well, I was the first to get to school I got like 1 hour of HIGH-speed internet. Which is always great for music transfers and IMing. Chatted with Karley..*I LOVE YA GAL* That day wasn't emotinal. But ok.   Last Day :'(  Ok. EMOTINAL! CRYING CITY!! I cant belive it I even cried. Especially when they did "Le Pont" Long story...It's a tearjerker. Awww. I'm crying. Just replaying it in my head. Had a hard time leaving school. Really hard. To imagine...next year, alone...in a new school...ENGLISH school. Eep. Scary. Dad is like "Ifya dont like the fucking school, change!" No, mom isn't home yet..*cries*   Well, lets get to my regular rants...&gt;:]   Yeh, today went out...skateboarded..with some friends. most of the day. After went out and bought two new CD's "The Darkeness" and "The Rasmus" (Rasmus ROCKS!!) [did you notice. I got my keyboard to work again..:P] My caps was jammed. Darn it...Angry at chain e-mails again I guess..heh. I haven't talked to Tae for awhile. I dont know whats up with him anymore... oh well. Someone else joined Scrrap the other day...I have no clue who he is...he seems nice enough though... I added him to MSN messenger, hoping maybe we could chat. But I guess not..its been like acouple of days and he hasn't added me...Aww well..   Fathers Day   You see, long ago...my dad did something..he hit me...and his ring got caught in my skin. so I have this scar on my face...I nevre went back to see him...I dont know...I'm scared now...I fear him...Well, his new wife Linda wants me to go to see him this weekend...its like do you think I am fucked?! Anyway...I dont want to be a part of that family..even though what I have now is falling apart...I'm offically dying...and no-one in my class knowes yet...please help...   Offically Dying  Yes...Sad But True...I suffer from S.A.D  Oh joy! More Pills to pop...*rolls eyes* I have an eating disorder...Nat told her mom. her mom told my mom [when she was still around] I guess it scared her away...bah...fuck her. I cant believe it...its all falling apart..for real...I have so many problems according to my Social Worker...lets make a list he said...then smiled in a really cheesy way...*ugh* 1. Self Harm issues 2. Eating Disorder 3. S.A.D 4. Massive Depression 5. Huge Mood Swings...its like, not normal  ugh...fuck it...I'm too embaressed to go on..

I got this wicked roxyâ¢ tee shirt...and I cant wear it, because the mf-ing bitchy preps will kill me. Either that or eat me alive. Ouch.  My dad is corny. I come in from school and ask him, as always "Hey, has mom came back home? or, did she call?" He always just smiles, and says no. Whatthefuck?!  Where is she? Why did she leave? Just like anything I ever had that was good. it either dies, or leaves.  cries  Why?! I just want an answer..she doesn't HAVE to come back if she doesn't care..right?  Definetly Right. Just...I dont feel like doing this long update...I'm to busy eating everything I can find! RIP Jenn and David! - Shay

       *cries*  Why? What is fake is falling apart. Help! Look, I know I dont live a fairytale life. But...why? Why do I always have to go and make up this fantasies for myself. Act as if everything is alright, when obviously it isn't. Ok, just to get all my fantasy readers into my real world here is how the story goes...  My mom, is dead. Nothing much to say here. Thats it. My dad, wants nothing to do with me because I'm a girl. So what?!. Meh, I live with the people I call "Mum  Pop". They never tell me anything. at all. I know they dont love each other like they used to but, please when something goes wrong...just tell me. I hate finding things out on my own. Its just wrong. Yeh. Wrong. Bah, Fuck it  I mean, nothing in my life has ever been remarkably "fun". I'm the one everyone hates to love. I'm sweet, caring...blah blah blah. Ok maybe not. I am anti social, a bitch to some extent, nosey, stuck-up and hot headed. If I was to go on...There would be no more room left...lol... I always get the pity...when someone finds out what happend...I'll try to lie..so that they treat me the same...but they  ALWAYS  find out!! WHY!? Bah. Fuck it.  But now...things with Mum and Pop aren't going so well...Its like I dont exist. They never tell me anything they always make it seem as if I am too much trouble for them. FUCK IT..!!  Well they tore it apart my  "family"  Are a bunch of nitwits and all hate each other. I came back from something with a special friend of mine, to find that  mum  wasn't home. I asked  pop  where she was...and he said she had left...To wherE? he will not tell me...Oh Goddammit! She still isn't back...and I came back last night!  *cries*   You see...everything is gone. All my illusions they are actually FAKE!   I wish I could talk to someone...but Meggiez and Mookie are up stairs and I dont want to bother them...{NO...THEY AREN'T DOING  THAT !!} Even someone online would be great..I talked to Joel...but that dont help me any...I dont know why I dont talk to Tae anymore...I guess its because he is annoyed with me...for not posting in Scrrap...Meh.   I cant talk to Billy..hes moving all day today. Joey was here...but its no use...I want to talk to Billy...Alot. Lets go see if his mobile is on...RIP Jenn~ SEM

      Oh Gawd. What has happened to innocent Sem?!She left...shes gone! Ok, so...Rick. Problem number one! Why Rick? He is so, nice...but he seems to forget that I have my own life. I can't always be "there". Right?  He has called me over six times. Always asking me if I can go out with him. I always say no. BEcause, I am not "into" him that way. I've told him SO many times...but he keeps going at me...:( He is now mad at Billy, he says its all Billys fault that I am not "into" him that way! Huh? He doesn't know apparently...Eep.   Went to the brige today. Seen where those two people were killed. So sad. There are flowers everywhere around the water...poor dude will be missed, Big Time. He died with his mom. Poor soul. How hard can it get?  I'm really tired. Tired of school mostly. Exams and all. &gt;.  Ok, currently...I'm in love with "Misfits" Oh yeah! Love em! TIGHT...I listen to them like 24/7...Aww...moi et la musique...insÃ©parable...;)  I cut my, my own hair. :| Erm like 6 inches off by myself. Heh, mom wasn't to happy. Meh. The hair is ok though, I think. I cut it right before grad. Hehehe...Fuck the hair. the dress the shoes. Every FUCKING DETAIL must DIE or BURN TO FUCKIN' HELL! Ack. That makes me feel a whole lot better...  I love this song...    HIM - Gone With The Sin    I love your skin, oh so white I love your touch cold as ice and I love every single tear you cry I just love the way you're losing your life  Oh, my baby how beautiful you are oh, my darling completely torn apart You're gone with the sin my baby and beautiful you are so, gone with the sin  I adore the despare in your eyes I worship your lips once red as wine and I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine I just love the way you're running out of life  I'll post more tomorrow...right now I feel sick...ewW...RIP Jenn..~On t'aime toute!

      No No No No! This cant be happening! No! There is only 6 days of school left. I usually dont care, like before there was always next year to talk to my friends...but now, there is no more "next year" And there is no more friends to talk to. I'm moving, so I am automatically changing schools. Dammit. Billy is moving to, but only two streets down. Meh. Lucy ass, gets his old friends back, he gets Joey, and the same town. Here I am, no Billy, no friends, no same town. Bah, I should just fuck it I guess...But I want a good chance,more like a fair chance a being sucessful at life and school...stuff like that.  I guess I'll have to get throught next year alone.  I will survive. I mean, new school chance of change..right? I dont want to change..but whateverâ¢ Hopefully they aren't a bunch of stuck up losers who they think they know it all...:P My choice of french to english is a bit drastic. I know. But hey, a highschool is a highschool is a highschool. *duh* Just a diffrent shit load of preps, right? :P Oh no, major factor: Preps. Yikes. They scare me. Uh-huh, yes they do :'( Maybe they'll belong to a nice society of preps. *Meh, dream on loser*  I dont know. The fact that I'll probably only be spending two years there makes me feel ALOT better. I wont be a prisonner in my own school. Just turned 16 in grade 11. Is that normal. I think so. I'm supossed to be in 12th because I was offered to take summer classes to get over 79 in math so I could boost up, but nah. Enough that I'm going to be new there, I dont want them to think I'm a french brainball...yucky.  I'm leaning towards their sports team. Basketball? Oh, hiya...it's my passion. ;) I hear at my new school they have "LAW" courses. Yayness. Oh, hiya...it's Law, my other passion. When Basketball and Law meet. ;)  *It's weird, Jenn wouldhave loved it..RIP Jenn :'(*  You know. I'm in love with this blogging thing. Like totally. No one reads it...but just to write and spread my thoughts. It feels awesome.   Oh, I joined a contest today at http://www.peta2.com "I am not a nugget" Yeh, you guessed it , I'm a vegatarien. :P I'm getting some stickers...YAY! :) So fun, so fun.  I just cut my hair, by myself...free hand. About 3 inches off the back. &gt;. .  Ha, 6 days. Just 6...please help me make a countdown.  RIP Jenn * Love ya Hun!

Which I threw up on sunday - I went and drank on saturday...*read previous posts*   I ran track again today...yucky, now I know why I am NOT on the track team...HA! LOL. Gym is hell this year. Hopefully, I can get away with just NOT getting it next year. Hoo Hoo Waa! No track, no running, no PaIn!   Julie hasn't been at school for awhile...because of Jenn...*cries* THIS IS SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP! I can't live like I used to...Bah, fuck it...meh...  Problem...my social worker thinks I'm totally suicidal..or fucked up, or whateverâ¢...He's fucked...totally! I hate him...FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!  Mookie wants the phone bad...just so Van can call him...then after April..Those girls are SO annoying...Well, I dont mind April. Shes alright...But I hate that Van girl...*yuck*  Right now, I'm talking to Nat's boyfriend, and his friend "pat" Ugh...they're idiots. I hate them. Yet, I talk to them *it kinda makes me wonder* I mean, if you hate someone...why bother wasting your time talking to them...it's pointless...right? I dont know. I guess its just to pass time off...  RIP Jenn* :'( ~Sem

      Billy wants to appear on my blog {bless his soul}. I told him that he already has. Then, he said he wanted to have something happy. So, Billy here we go :P  ..::Billy, I love ya! So so much! I hope that I will see ya more often since I am changing school's this year! You said we'd be friends forever! Keep that promise, I can't live without you. (I dont think anyone could.:D)::..  Anyway. *shrugs* Today, I had P.E. Dammit. We ran 600meters, then went on to the Long jumping. &gt;.  &gt;&gt;Listens to H.I.M Funeral of Hearts It's really awesome. The words make me think. Like, after me and Benn broke up, I dont know how many times I listened to THAT song and just cried. (With Billy of course) He didn't cry as much as me. I dont recall him crying. I recall going shopping and buying some sweats at Roots. With him. Aww, he was with me...Pity Shopping. He bought me a charm bracelet that day too...He got me like four charms. The Irish flag, the french flag, a basketball and a volleyball. So sweet. Now I have a customized one that says Billy  Em BFF. Aww...;)  Another thing to consider...BFF...Best Friends Forever. I doubt it with some people who say it. But Billy and me ARE best friends. :S We shop together, we eat together, we cry together (in times of need) *duh*, he's like my best Gal friend. :D  Alot of noise here. Alex is playing Tony Hawk 4, I'm listening to H.I.M, the phone is ringing, I can hear James and Kaddie {friends of mine} practicing our new song, my mom is shouting at me...Hurrah, I'm talking to like 7 people online, and they are all talking at the same time...*doodleedee*! Arg! I'm trying to work here! *screams*  Nat is at soccer. I hope she won. That would be to awesome, then she could just shut up at school ;).   I took a magazine quiz today. It said I was to depressed for my age group... WTF. They said if they were my parents they would have me put on watch...*sighs* I'm, not going to kill myself. Look face it. I am not the suicidal "type" Well, I am but..I made a promise to Billy. So there. My mom is going nuts. She read my mag and was like, "Well, we should consider it" Whaaaaaaat? No. No. No. No. No! No attitude ajustment! Why me?! Why?!  I went out for some pizza with my friends.  &gt;Jane &gt;Krista &gt;Julie &gt;Lucie &gt;Francois &gt;Alex We were all supossed to go to the park after. But I wanted to go home. Lets start walking eh? Bah, Pizza was awful. Yuck. {Veggie for me :D} We all made GawdAwful drink mixtures. Like Ketshup and vinagire with diet 7up. I drank it. Ew. *vomits* Yuck!  I think I better start working on my NEW french project...*yay* &gt;.</post></Blog>
