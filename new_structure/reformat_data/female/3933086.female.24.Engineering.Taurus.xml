      Afellow had just been hired as the new CEO of a large high tech corporation. The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. "Openthese if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve," he said. Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later,  salestook a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. about at his wits's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. Themessage read, "Blame your predecessor." The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street -- responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.   about a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems.   Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, "Reorganize." This he did, and the company quickly rebounded. After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.  Themessage said, "Prepare three envelopes."

      In Chinese culture, the response to a compliment is different. The hostess will insist that she is a poor cook, or that her home is far from neat and tidy. This is a part of modesty usually expresses by the Chinese people, a reaction that is completely different from that in the West. This response usually puzzles the Westerner. In the Western countries, it is considered polite to thank the person who pays you a compliment. This does not mean you agree with the compliment, but it expresses your thanks for the kindness of the other person. You should accept thanks with a degree of humility.

      Paying a compliment is expressing one's praise, admiration or appreciation. You may admire your friend's clothes, hairdo, nice home, good cooking or excellent work. This is meant to be extended with sincerity, and the person should accept the compliment with a simple "Thank you," or "I'm glad you enjoyed it."

 uNon-adherence (95%-100% adherence required)  uBaseline resistance or cross-resistance  uUse of less potent antiretroviral regimens  uSequential monotherapy  uDrug levels and drug interactions  Antiretroviral Rx: Conclusions  â¢In the U.S., antiretroviral therapy decreased HIV/AIDS morbidity/mortality ~80% since 1995.  â¢  â¢When to start? CD4  â¢What to start? A number of preferred and alternative options.  â¢When to change? Consider clinical, immunologic, virologic and resistance issues.  â¢What to change to? Use resistance testing, new drugs/classes, and newer strategies.  â¢Further research will help answer these questions.  How is Mental Health Relevant to the HIV Epidemic?  uHIV infection can only be contained by behavior change.  uHIV infection invades the brain at initial infection and has a profound impact on it.  uMental illness and its management figure prominently in all stages of HIV infection.

      ART and CNS Injury  â¢Longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed that the HIV+ subjects on ART had greater rates of ongoing white matter loss than HIV- controls (p = 0.0013)  â¢  â¢Greater rates of ongoing white matter loss were significantly correlated with:  âhigher viral load (r = -0.25, p  âlower CD4 counts (r = -0.27, p     Weiner et.al., UCSF, CROI, 2004.

      Summary  â¢Psychiatric symptoms are common among those with HIV infection, but often not reported or asked about  â¢Depression is common and associated with nonadherence to HAART  increased mortality  â¢Depression is often untreated or undertreated  â¢Psychiatric disorder and substance abuse are associated with nonadherence      Conclusion  â¢These findings support the need for integrated mental health, substance abuse and medical treatment for HIV-infected patients    Case Example  â¢John is a 38 year old white, single male with a long H/O alcohol dependence, homeless, admitted to a Bronx hospital when found in street unresponsive, treated acutely, detoxed ï¼ä½¿æææ¯ç¾ï¼and transferredï¼è½¬ç§»å°ï¼to SNF  â¢1st meeting: lying in bed, HIV wasting, unable to walk, refusing to talk (âdonât need a psychiatristâ)    CNS Manifestations of HIV Infection  Primary CNS Infection by HIV  â¢HIV-associated dementia( ç´å)ï¼HAD)  â¢Minor cognitive-motor disorderï¼è½»åº¦è®¤ç¥åè¿å¨ç´ä¹±ï¼ (MCMD)  HIV-Associated Dementia  SUBCORTICAL DEMENTIA  SIMILAR TO:    â¢Huntingtonâs dementia (äº¨å»·é¡¿ç´åç)  â¢Parkinsonâs disease    HIV-Associated Dementia  â¢Acquired abnormality in at least two cognitive abilities for at least one month:ï¼å¨è³å°ä¸¤ç§è®¤ç¥è½åä¸æç»­è³å°ä¸ä¸ªæçè·å¾æ§ç¸å½¢ï¼  âSpeed of information processing  âAttention/concentration  âAbstractionï¼æåï¼/reasoning  âVisuospatialï¼è§è§ç©ºé´çï¼ skill  âMemory/learning  âSpeech/language  HIV-Associated Dementia  Acquired abnormality in motor function:  â¢Tremor (hand)ï¼æ¯é¢¤ï¼  â¢Gaitï¼æ­¥æ³ï¼ instability  â¢Leg weakness  â¢Paraplegiaï¼æªç«ï¼  â¢Arm weakness  â¢Urinary/bowel incontinenceï¼å°ä¾¿å¤±ç¦åè éå¤±ç¦ï¼  HIV-Associated Dementia  Emotional/behavioral symptoms:  â¢Social withdrawalï¼ä¸ç±åå ç¤¾äº¤æ´»å¨ï¼  â¢Apathyï¼å·æ¼ ï¼  â¢Agitation ï¼å´å¥ï¼  â¢Paranoid delusionsï¼çæ³éè§ï¼  â¢Hallucinationsï¼å¹»è§ï¼  HADï¼è¾æ»çç¸å³ç´åçï¼ Risk Factors  â¢Study of 139 HIV infected patients, who had cerebrospinal fluidï¼èèæ¶²ï¼ (CSF) measurements and neurological evaluations, including neuropsychological tests 6 months apartï¼æ ¹æ®å¯¹139 ä¸ªåHIVçæ¯ææççäººçç ç©¶æ¾ç¤ºï¼ä»ä»¬é½æ¥åäºèèæ¶²æµéåç¥ç»å­¦è¯ä¼°ï¼å¶ä¸­åæ¬æ¯6ä¸ªæä¸æ¬¡çç¥ç»å¿çå­¦æµè¯ï¼    â¢CSF HIV RNA levels (&gt; 200 copies/ml) were the best predictor of subsequent deficits in motor and cognitive function    (Ellis et.al., Archives of Neurology, 2002)  HAD Risk Factors  â¢CSF viral load  â¢High plasma viral load  â¢CD4 cell count  â¢Age  â¢Low hematocrit  Neuropathogenesis of HAD  â¢One of the pathological hallmarks in HIV-associated dementia is neuron death, but neurons are not directly infected by HIV-1.  â¢Chemokines are implicated in HIV neuropathogenesis, and are expressed by several types of neural cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons.
