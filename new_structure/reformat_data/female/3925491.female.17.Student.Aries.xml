      Indignation  You, is where my heart should be And you, you are the one who hates me  I donât want your liability I donât need your ecstasy You see youâre right You see youâre well But you think this saves me from your hell  You think my head is in your hands But you canât even understand Why are you so blind to see My dream is your reality  Let me sleep and you shall see That youâre not all you seem to be Let me breath the air, I swear I hope Iâll put you in despair

      Burn Usher [Intro] I donât understand why See itâs burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that donât mean I want to What Iâm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  [Verse 1] Itâs gonna burn for me to say this But itâs comin from my heart Itâs been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I donât think youâre gonna change I do but you donât Think itâs best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When Iâm hurting baby, I ainât happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When your feeling ainât the same and your body donât want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ainât jumpinâ like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know itâs best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that itâs over We know that itâs through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Verse 2] Sendinâ pages I ainât supposed to Got somebody here but I want you Cause the feelin ainât the same by myself Callinâ her your name Ladies tell me do you understand? Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? Itâs the way I feel I know I made a mistake Now itâs too late I know she ainât comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh Man I donât know what Iâm gonna do Without my booo Youâve been gone for too long Itâs been eleven days, um-teen hours Imma be burninâ till you return (let it burn)  [Chorus] When your feeling ainât the same and your body donât want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ainât jumpinâ like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gonâlearn) Let it burn (gotta let it burn) Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know its best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that itâs over We know that itâs through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Bridge] Iâm twisted cuz one side of me is tellinâ me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) Iâm twisted cuz one side of me is tellinâ me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  [Breakdown] Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burninâ?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh  So many days, so many hours Iâm still burninâ till you return  [Chorus] When your feeling ainât the same and your body donât want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ainât jumpinâ like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know itâs best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that itâs over We know that itâs through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn

      HATRED  The first time that we met Ifelt everything is fine. I feel like I'm in heaven and you're the angel's given you make me feel so special that I make you too special. But what happened to the promise you made for love?  In the other side of m mind something whispering I hear saying leave him! I cry myself to sleep everytime I think you leave and the frightened day is here you're gonna leave me,nothing words to hear...  you leave me standing in the rain all alone without somebody to took me home you leave me for another girl who you think is better but believe me she didn't and wouldn't be but if you're sure not to change your mind I'll let you leave me here in the dark  Coz' I know somebody will save me from this pain sorry to the boy who lose the love of mine for the other girl who played six or nine Sorry to say but that feeling called love is in the air above..
