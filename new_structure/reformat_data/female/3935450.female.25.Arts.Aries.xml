       It's Saturday and I feel so shitty.  This is probably the first Saturday in forever that I haven't been shopping.  I'm misty eyed and jaded.        I spoke to Eric yesterday and the more I think about him the more I lose interest.  I keep hearing him tell me how his opinion of me has changed....(PUKE! ) My thoughts are If you don't like it, forget it! He doesn't like me anyway.  I think he's just interested in sex.  He has potential to be awesome.  He's super funny, handsome, but soooo tense at times.  Everytime I say something sarcastically, I have to tell him--JOKE or he takes me seriously.  I guess thats going to go far.       Today I'm starting induction.  I'm going to stay under 20 carbs for the next two weeks.  I've been eating poorly the last few days.  Not anymore.  Zippy carbs for Maya :)  Sugar what?       I'm listening to Ave Maria and I think I'm going to just cry myself a river.  Time to change it up a notch... lets see...Now, it's Sade's By Your Side--I think of Kat telling me lastnight that she had been with her husband throughout the entire stay in the hospital...and she wouldn't have it any other way.  She loved every minute she got to spend with him.  "When you're cold, I'll be there to hold you tight to me".  Gosh,  I'm weak, dammit!       I need to stop feeling so sad.  Death is depressing and I feel like its all around me.  There is normally 3 in a row....I'm wondering who the hell is next????  "The Wages of Sin is Death" Kat's father, My uncle, has Cancer as well and isn't expected to survive much longer either...My heart goes out to her.  But she's keeping the faith.  One of my favorite quotes "God only gives me as much as I can handle, I just wish he didn't trust me so much"   I'm sure that's what Kat's feeling this a.m.       I can't dwell on this.  I have to think of something more positive.  I think I'm going to go run and just release some tention.  And after that   I think I'm going to go shopping.  That always feels good.        So...   Amaya complains a lot.  Mostly about petty shit too.  MEN &gt; LOVE LOST&gt; DAY TO DAY LIFE....whatever it is....I complain a hell of lot!  I rarely am grateful for much anymore.  I think that all started when M decided to walk out of my life.   I've never been bitter.  I am now as a result.  I've got to get over this hump, til then I'm phucked.       I live a good life.  I do as I please.  I work hard, I travel often, date casually, fuck seriously, and complain often....K.  I made myself laugh.  Seriously, God has been good to me.  I beat AML, I have a great family who loves me, supports me 100% who will do anything for me.  These people are my everything.  And I concentrate so much on random guys when in reality only 2 have been good enough to be apart of my family...Everyone knows that's Adam  Aaron.        Adam--24, All American Boy who served in the Navy, Loves his family as much as I do, he's so passionate about me.  I'm convinced that no guy will ever love me as much as he does or did.  He loves me, flaws  all.

       Today has been a real challenge for me.  I woke up to the news that My cousin's husband had died almost immeadiately after I was there at the hospital lastnight.  I knew he wouldn't live much longer, but he was taken too damn quick.  He's out of his misery now.  He's no longer suffering.  He was such a nice man.  Always smiling, always friendly.  I wasn't  that  close to him, but it hurts to see my family hurting.  I'm extremely sensitive.  I cry at the drop of a hat.        It's still so freaking hard to believe.  He was so young.  Mom always says that God takes his angels first....      Becca, Missy, Eric, Emma  I went to dinner tonight and totally pigged out. tons of dessert, pastas, wines, and a lot of Calamari later we ran into another cousin, Allen, who was in town because of the death in our family...we all just vented to each other and hugged and it felt so good to express all of these feelings that I'm having...the shock, the sadness, the pain..He left to go visit my cousin, the 30 year old, who is now a freaking widow....Then I asked for our check and our server says that we have none!  Shocked of course, we asked what she meant, so she said that Allen paid for everyone's dinner at our table!  K...So nice of him, however, we had a really exspensive dinner.  It was probably nearly somewhere around $200, including gratuity.  So that made me smile.  It was such a surprise and a totally sweet gesture.  It made my evening better.       On a much better note, I got a call from Adam today...He has a bar now, is doing well.  Talking to him though, it makes me miss him--for real.  We probably won't be talking again for a while, but we'll see.       Scott is doing well. Eric is good too.  Issaac is fantastic....      I've had lots of random conversations with "T", he's doing well.  He wants Nicole back.  He truly loves this woman.  I think he's scared to let go of his pride and just tell her that he wants her and she wants him too, dammit!!!  He emailed me an article about relationships and such, I can't bring myself to read it.  He knows I can relate because of all the drama with M.M.   He got wasted lastnight...I'm sure he's hungover now...sick too perhaps.  He's so adoreable sometimes.....      It's nearly 2 am. I'm going to go to bed....      update more, later!   *~A~*

      Woman to Woman Encouragement.Someone will always be prettier. They will always be smarter. Their house will be bigger. They will drive a better car. Their children will do better in school. And their husband will fix more things around the house. So let it go, and love you and your circumstances. Think about it. The prettiest woman in the world can have hell in her heart. And the mosthighly favored woman on your job may be unable to have children. And the richest woman you know -- she's got the car, the house, the clothes --might be lonely. And the word says if I have not Love, I am nothing.So, again, love you. Love who you are right now and let God be your barometer. Mirror Him. Look in the mirror in the morning and see how much of God you see. He's the only standard and even when you come up short; He will not leave you or forsake you. Smile and may God continue to bless you. "I am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed!" The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor. "The one who kneels to God can stand up to anything." "Winners make things happen. Losers let thingshappen."Be Blessed ladies and pass this on to encourage another woman. "To the world you might be one person, but to one person you just might be the world."   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In other news...Work was great. I went to dinner with Haven  Mathew. He's sooooooo sweet. I feel sooooooooooooooo happy when he's around.   I called Scott today. I shouldn't have. I should have waited to see if he would call me, but silly me had to go and do it first! He said lastnight became lousy. I guess what he was trying to convey to me was the fact that she was a lousy lay.NO?   I'm going to go for a run...writing that pissed me off.

      Brandi sent me a link to Craigslist, which I read often..it's hilarious, this though, I think has made my day.   TO THE GIRL IN THE HOT DRESS  You, looking hot in a black dress. Me riding in a correctional bus. Our eyes met through the metal slats. I was in orange. The driver wouldn't stop. He didn't understand. If you are willing to wait, I am available to date in march, 2007 (or sooner with good behavior). Please write.

        Today has just been wrong already. I got a sweet email from Issaac. He's on US soil now :) Yay! We're going to talk tonight. Scott was nursing his classy, drunk ass friend back to sobriety lastnight. Promised to call when he got back to the hotel room, never called. I'm not pissed. His lost not mine.           Aaron is being totally ridiculas. I guess he thinks I should spend all of my time sitting on the phone with him. I don't know how to tell him that I'm not feeling the same way he is. Which sucks, he's a great guy. I love him dearly.           I was with chatting with Eric when Aaron called lastnight. Eric is an interesting character. He's very attractive. I'm still feeling him out too. I'm not sure if we have anything in common. I'm more family oriented. I love my family, I'm always with them. He's just different I think. Who knows, I barely know him.      It's so odd...Scott is so cute and handsome, Eric is very hot, but I'll take Scott anyday over Eric....Theres just something about him. He's so sweet. Sometimes. When he calls. What I'm trying to say is that although Eric is probably better looking than Scott, Scott is the one I'm mostly attracted to.           I think I'm going to compile a background on all the guys just because I don't want to get them confused!!!           I have a headache. I need to get laid. Everyday.                I think I may go see Batwoman tonight. I want to see it, but do I go alone?           I read this article this morning....I found it cute.  urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=storyu=/ap/20040728/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_kids_for_kerry                Brandi sent me this via email, I have to share!    VACANCY - WOMB FOR RENT **************************** Hi Gentlemen, My name is Maggie. I'm 26 years old, attractive  sexy. I'm an aspiring actress and landlady of a very special piece of property. I'm placing my property on the market. This is a beautiful piece of property, that will comfortably accommodate one nice man, and occasionally a women, if there's a party.   TENANT REQUIREMENTS:  1) Male tenant preferred and Female visitors allowed 2) Must be successfully employed, or retired 3) Must be clean cut, honest, and reliable 4) Must be respectful of the Landlady's property and treat it gently and with the utmost care. In seeking a tenant the Landlady does not discriminate by age or race.  PROPERTY FEATURES:  1) Very small  tight quarters. Perfect to lay your head down. 2) Manicured and neatly trimmed dark blond shrubbery, leading to a bright pink inviting entrance. 3) The interior is always well kept, clean, and fresh. The landlady always keeps the place nicely scented. 4) The property comes with all original appliances, that were installed 26 years ago. The appliances are in excellent condition, hardly used and well mantained. 5) The property is always dark, damp, and moist, and doesn't get much sunlight. However,the few tenants that have occupied the property in the past have really enjoyed it that way. 6) There is a 'WELL' on the property, that will spout a gusher from time to time. In order to get the benefit  pleasure of the gusher, it will be the tenant's sole responsibility to correctly sink a shaft and erect a pump. The pumping must be done vigorously. During the pumping, the tenant must supply and place a couple of his own large stones near the opening to the 'WELL', thus preventing anyone from falling in accidently. Please note, when removing your shaft  pump you must be careful not to leave the opening any larger then you originally found it. This helps to prevent any unauthorized use or entry into the 'WELL'. 7) The entire property is free of all diseases and vermin. The tenant must promise to keep it that way. 8) The exterior facade of the property is absolutely beautiful. It features a blond colored roof, freshly touched up, but mostly natural. There are two large round headlights mounted near the top of the facade. The high-beams are pointed straight ahead, and not towards the ground. This lights up the entire driveway making it easier for you to enter the property at night. 9) They always say, "Location, Location, Location". This property is centrally located in Manhattan.   HOUSE RULES: 1) Please, No Dogs Allowed. But a little Pussy is nice. 2) Party  Entertaining Policy: The walls are strong and in great shape. So, having loud and wild parties, and banging against the walls is allowed  encouraged. Also, if you have a couple of friends that you hang around with, and they're 'NUTS', it's okay to invite them. They're always the life of the party. 3) All deliveries must come in the front door. There is a very nice rear door, but that's ONLY used to take out the trash. 4) You must be able to move in and out, rapidly and repeatedly, on short notice, if necessary. 5) Sorry, no short term transients. You must make a commitment to a long term lease. 6) All prospective tenant's must pass a credit and background check, prior to taking possession to the property. 7) The rent is negotiable. Make an offer. The tenant should feel free to make improvements to the property at their own expense. Redecorating  dressing the property up, as well as scenting it with expensive perfumes, is highly recommended.   APPLICATION PROCESS: If you're interested in applying for this property, then email your application to the landlady with all your important details. It would greatly help if you would describe the tenant and the size of your personal belongings. Since, the premises are VERY SMALL  TIGHT, you may not be able to fit large personal belongings. Send photo of tenant and personal belongings, if available. Upon receipt of your email, I will immediately send all approved applications, photos of the landlady together with her fine piece of property. If you like what you see in the photos, we can arrange a private showing. At which time you may be asked to leave a deposit on the premises. So please come prepared.  Best Regards, Maggie  P.S. Also for convenience, there is an eating establishment on the premises, for those who enjoy eating at the 'Y'.     I found it funny :)           Now I'm going to go add my Platinum Taffy to my hair  go nuts with the hair dryer.           I'll update more later...

        Has to be the sweetest lady around! I came home from a day of doing nothing to hear her sweet message..."Amaya, this is Rebecca, your grandmother, as if I couldn't distinguish her voice from my sister Rebecca's), Sweetheart, I made your favorite peanut butter pie today with a homemade meringue and I don't want the crust sitting long so whenn you get home from work come by and pick it up and have some coffee with us." That definetly made my day. My grandmother is too damn sweet. We both share a really bad sweet tooth. I remember growing up as a child and helping her bake in her kitchen, thats when it was fun, licking the spoons and eating homemade frosting with your fingers! Needless to say, I'm going over tonight after I unwind and I'm in my pajamas where I'm super comfy eating peanut butter pie with Grandma. To hell with the carbs, the fat, the sugar intake...pffffffftttt thats all out the door tonight! I think I'm even going to skip my workout, even!           I woke up bright  early feeling a bit guilty aboutlying to someone whom I've developed feelings for. I hate that I did that, but I didn't feel like I could answer his question with the truth. As sad as that is...           My day went rather well. Mike called  woke me up, he says that he's lonely living in the hotel...He's moving into an apartment in Georgetown on Saturday. He said that Melanie is leaving for Australia on Sunday, by telling me that alone I know that he's had contact with her. Everything is a lie with him. Thats so messed up though. The entire situation. I guess I should wave my white flag.           I spoke to "T" lastnight. He's so increadiably human, it's so easy to just talk to this man.He said something that moved me, I had a moment!!! He said that he was searching for homes and he actually wanted Nicole's opinion on the home before he went into contract....he said that he just wants her to be apart of it. How sweet is that?!!! I like how he's becoming passionate about getting backwith herafter he basically called it quits, and now she's saying they need time away from each other.I'm sure if it's meant to be, it will be. And this morning, like the idiot I can be sometimes, I call this number that I didn't reconize until I heard "T"'s voicemail. I felt like such an idiot!He called back  I explained to him what had happened, he laughed it off, THANK GOD!!! I was mortified.           I also talked to Scottie-to-Hottie lastnight as well. He was a bit drunk but so damn sweet at the same time. He told me that he wanted to be with me!! Isn't that what I've been wanting? I think so :) Ask me tommorrow, that could all change overnight!!! Just kidding. We talked until I got sleepy. He will be home on Thursday. I can't wait. He travels so much with work it makes me sick! Thats his job though. I can't complain. I travel a lot as well.            And news of the day---I called Broke Asstoday. I can't believe I did it. I just picked up my cell and dialed his stupid work number from memory and he answered. The odd thing is, he didn't know whoI was!!! (WHAT WAS I THINKING)We talked briefly about him and then I said "I Miss ya"!!! Then I got this huge punch right in the arm from Haven! She couldn't believe I was telling him that. I had to tell him that. I did miss him. I have no excuse. I wasn't drunk. I have nothing to blame it on. I'm ashamed of myself. Haven said that she's never seen me so weak before. Scary. I do miss the fucker. He was awesome. It was the freaking Avril song...My Happy Ending. MOVING ON.

        ~Super tired right now, I went to Bible Study. Got my learn on. I thoroughly enjoyed it.           ~Worked out fiercely, lifting Kennedy from Baby Carrier to Baby Bouncer, to my bed to my floor. Pushing Emma on the swings was tough as well. No workout comes close to being as hard as playing Hide  Go Seek with Isaiah. My workout was intense, overall. More emotionally than physically. No worries. I will go nuts tommorrow.           ~Scott phoned from Houston, at a bar with his brother. Sooooooo cute.     ~'T' is adoreable too. Rocks my socks :) I'd hit it!!!      ~Emma is saying Puerto Rico all the time. She's excited to be going. About as much as I am.   ~Isaiah said I was more of a Velma/Thelma from Scooby Doo. I was offended at first, because She's disgusting, has bad taste, dresses poorly and has coke bottle thick glasses--Then he told me I was more like her because I'm sooooooooo smart!!! I was flattered afterall. In the end I'm glad, because the blonde guy isn't my type at all. Jesuth Chrith, he's Thuper Gay!  ~I'm off to bed. No wet dreams.    Amaya

We're going to go back again real soon.          Lastnight, Michelle, Kellie, Haven, Becca, Trish, Kevin, Stacy, Danny, Ross, Ian, Courtney, Rick, Mason went to a carnival. It was soo much fun being a kid again. I actually rode the Ferris wheel...just like old times. I bought home my cotton candy  candy apples. I was a happy girl.          Scott called while I was out with everyone so we didn't get to talk much. I called at 2 am when I got home but to no avail.          "T" was supposed to call too. He didn't! SHAME SHAME!!!

        I'm feeling Avril Lavigne's newest song "Happy Ending" I've been singing it all day!           Scott  Brad are leaving town tonight...Back next week. I think I'll miss him :) I think it's blatant that I'm crushing on him. He's such a good guy. We get along well thus far. Does that mean all the others are out of the picture? Not exactly ;) Not yet anyway.           So I lost a pair of Jimmy Choo's. I'm soooooo going to die if I don't find them. They're the cutest black shoes ever! So summer 2004 too. I'm thinking they're in Myrtle Beach :(           Mom called today, we leave for Puerto Rico on the 29th. I'm only going to be gone for 5 days, while they're staying an entire 10! Bastards. But the gallery would fall apart if I was gone longer than 5 days.           Tonight is Kellie's Birthday. Michelle, Brandi, Lisa, Haven, Kristi, Matt, Trevor, Cameron, Brian, Becca, Courtney, Tara, and the list goes on are all meeting for dinner @ 8:00 @ Milano or Sequoia's not sure yet...Then on to a night of celebrating. I won't be celebrating much though. Too many carbs in the drinks for my taste.           Aaron told me he loved me lastnight. How cute is that?!!! He's definetly one of my bestest friends forever. Not in love though. I have my eye on Scott :) For right now!          Oh and Vishal Milino wants to take me to Crete. I'm about to say yes. He's so damn hot. Armani, Versace, Gucci everything, everyday. The man has style, the man has grace. It's just too bad you can't buy cool. I think I can do a few days in Greece though, even with an uptight man. I could loosen him up though :)           On to the shower...          ~*AMAYA*~

       Today has been pretty uneventful. I just went to the office sporting Juicy Couture, a tank, and a ponytail with my Dior's. I was scrubbing! And I didn't care either. I signed  notarized some contracts, checked my voicemail and got out of there. The day was too pretty to be stuck inside.       Scott leaves town tommorrow :( Guess that means that it's a girls night out again!Can't wait.       So, I paid bills today, went to the bank and had lunch with Mom. She's so awesome. I'm such a Mama's Girl....I don't know though, Daddy's Girl too! Dammit--I'm both.      Daddy's Birthday is on August 14th, Mom's is August 5th, and we're planning a big birthday party for them. The location has been set yet, but we're thinking Fairfax Country Club. Thats all still up in the air. But I love planning events and such so this is going to be fun :)      Tara gets married August 7th, She's registered at Neiman's  Nordstrom's  Tiffany's. That's going to be fun, buying presents for everyone else! Right.      Jeremy also gets married on August 7th. It's weird how I got invited. I wonder if he wonders if I care. My grandparents are going. My Mom  Dad are going. I think thats rather gay, but to each their own.       I'm going to go running and hopefully I'll feel better. I've been eating the hell out of Karb Karma Super Fudge Chunk by Ben  Jerry....The God's of Ice cream.       Tommorrow Ian  I are playing tennis and then I'm getting my roots did. Mario will be the only man that will touch my hair. In a non sexual way! But then again, Mario is hot, love his Croatian accent, mmmmmm! I'd do him. The guy is sex on legs. His cologne, his mannerisms, his winks, his gestures, his smile, the way he bites his lip, the way he leans in to talk to me and his chest rubs against my tits--I think I want that!!! He's always been interested and dammit, I'm getting laid this weekend!!!!      K...Me  My horny ass is going to go running...As if I need anymore endorphines :)         SUPERGIRL!

       I was up too late with Scott lastnight, I'm super tired. Lisa called at 6:00 am and asked if I could watch Kennedy for few hours, I said sure. I didn't realize I had to climb my happy ass out of bed to actually drive 10 mins in my jammies to pick her up! That was nothing compared to having to pump gas in Pajamas and paying for it inside because the machine wouldn't read my debit card!!! So Kennedy  I came home and we climbed into my bed and fell asleep. I woke up around 9 ish and she was awake just laying there trying to talk to me!!! SOOOOOOOO CUTE. She didn't even cry, she just laid there. I'm in love with this child already. I think she's going to be mine too :)       I worked out lastnight from 8-9. Ate healthy all day too. My butt is a rock!!! So firm. Definetly a runner's butt :) Things are getting back to the way they once were. I realized that the only cd I ever listen to while working out is Britney's CD. I love it. It's upbeat, it slows down, it's awesome. Love her cd even :)       I just checked my email and Pyscho Kenny emailed me from another email address, thats blocked now too. He's really a twisted human being. What part of STOP doesn't he get? I'll paste the email.        This may be a product of my newfound conscience, but I don't like having people  carrying around animosity toward me {Since when?}. We've been through this a few times {WE have?}, so no, I don't expect us to be close or anything like that {Smart man}, I just want to apologize for anything that I said that may have offended you {SICK, HE MAKES ME SICK}. No, I'm not "psycho" {He's never proven me wrong} or a "stalker" {He's attempted all means to contact me even nonstop via phone, what would you call it? Denial perchance?}I was just tryin to make things work with us{There was never an US}. Anyway, as the song  says, "Don't go away mad, just go away." So, that's what I think we should do{This is about the 5th email about just going away, it's never been done yet}. I  feel like I went out on a rather classless note {Classless note ---&gt;classless person,does 2+2=4?}, and I felt badly about that{Tear!} Good luck with everything, again{Right}, I apologize for what I said{Haha, uh huh}. Apparently I have a tendancy to lose it here and there {You think? I never noticed!}(although I'm sure you knew that).       Kenny {STALKER}   So thats the email. Everything in brackets are my thoughts. He's a weirdo for sure.   So lastnight was interesting...Aaron called, we talked for a while. I'm going to hang out with my cutie pants for a few days at the end of the month. I haven't seen him in so long. He's so adoreable. He's the one guy friend that I've had forever that has never changed or has ever said or treated me unfairly or improperly. He's my definetion of gentlemen. Great guy.  He likes peanut butter too :) We ate peanut butter together on the phone lastnight!!! Talk about weird conversations--we have those! DORKS!   Scott told me that he's interested in me :) (like I didn't know) We're going to hang out in a few days and actually go on a real date. He had a rough day at work yesterday. The family business thing is hard to do. I'm glad Mom doesn't work with me! We'd be at each other's throats al the time! Anyway, the bad thing about Scott is that work is his life--he's going to be leaving town for Houston on Friday won't be back until Thursday of next week. I'm not sure if I like that :/   Issaac is in his transition phase. He's going to be back home sometime this week I think :) I can't wait. It's Top Secret, the actual date. But if my sources are correct, he'll be back home on Thursday :) We shall see!   Kennedy is napping now so I'm going to get my shower while she's asleep. I'm going to be at the office til 6 tonight, then I'm working out, I told Mike that we could have dinner while the bitch is out of town. We shall see.  Amaya

      My lovely Brandi has gone nuts!!! Here is the email she sent...Loco Chic!    WANTED:  Slick, savvy and charismatic tycoon-to-be with the fortitude to make a fortune with anything from land investment to lemonade production  Amaya,   The Apprentice's Donald Trumpis doing a nationwide search for the next Apprentice! You must apply or I will apply for you. You're Slick, Savvy and Charismatic, Total Tycoon to be to!! You have the look, the brains and the attitudetoat the very least make it to the semi-finalsso do it already or I will tai chi your ass, girl! Matt said that he is going to make you apply to! Here is the application it's a PDF so open it now! I'll be getting ideas together for your VHS debut.          Now, I'm convinced that she's gone totally nuts or she's smoking crack!!! Perhaps both. The questions are super gay too, An Embarrassing moment?God knows I have plenty...A major event in my life? Uhm, losing my virginity?Why am I successful in Business? Cuz I'm cute dammit!!! KIDDING :) She's a dork. It's keeps getting worse..Needless to say, I won't be applying.                So I went to my meeting with Santos yesterday. Nobody told me he was a Greek God! Single too. Gotta luv that. So witty. Attractive. Contract signed :)           Anyway--I went to Bible Study after I lusted all evening. A lot of people find it strange that I'm so passionate about learning about something that can be so trivial. I like the idea of having faith in a Higher Being. Jesus is that to me. It's not 'cool' or 'acceptable' to be religious at my age. But I don't care what society thinks. I'm comfortable with it, I love it and it's a passion. I try to read scriptures daily and apply them. There is nothing better than the power of Prayer. I always find myself praying. Waking up, Throughout the day, before eating, before bed. Sometimes my prayers are soo long that I find myself falling asleep! I always give Thanks and note what I'm thankful for each and everyday. I'm far from perfect. I'm a sinner. It's human nature to sin. It's asking for forgiveness, it's trying to notcommit the sin anymore--which is soooooooo hard, that will help me overcome temptation. Like this weekend, the way we partied, SO WRONG. I knew better. I regretted it. I didn't even go to Church on Sunday. Thats when I definetly should have went. Communioun is another must. I missed out on it again. Everytime I miss it, I feel like I'm rejecting Christ....so wrong. I will get better.           After Bible Study, I worked out--Hard too!!! 2 hours of Cardio. I worked on some proposals and then fell asleep atop my bed, no blankets on me at all, thats how exhausted I was. I woke up mid morning to the phone ringing. TMike was out drunk wanting to come over...I hung up on him. He just got back from the Hamptons. It rained all week there :) His tan isn't that good!!!           I am going to have lunch with Dad today, play some tennis, pick Isaiah up from swimming lessons for Becca, then Emma, Isaiah  I are going to the library for story hour and maybe, depending on the time, go to Grandma's and swim. I haven't worked on the tan in a while... The sun is my addiction.           I still have to find a Cingular store around me! The website is gay.            More later :)    ~*Amaya*~

            My quick fix for a Hangover. I don't know why I allowed myself to get so wasted. It wasn't cool at all. I made so many drunk phone calls. God forbid I said or did anything that offended anyone.            I didn't wake up in time for church. I haven't been in so long. I feel terrible about that. I need to get back on track. This destructive behaviour isn't me, at all.            Isaiah and I ordered Fattening Italian food loaded with Carbs. *YAY* Veryyummy, but I feel bloated and disgusted by eating it. My lil Isaiah is so cute, we ate his spaggetti a la ~"Lady and The Tramp" style...Super cute even. It fot a lil messy but anything to make him smile :)            Yesterday was scary. We were shopping, Marathon style--Mom, Becca, Haven  Me along with Chandler  Isaiah. Becca, Mom  Haven were still trying on clothes at Banana Republic, I had already selected everything I wanted and paid, Isaiah was restless and getting bored. I offered to take him over to Barnes  Noble to chill with a Sugar-Free MochaFrap with extra Whip Cream and Chocolate Shavings--Just the way we luv it! So we got our 'Frappies' and we went to the children's reading corner, he was looking for books on Sharks, I was on my cell with Aaron, I told Isaiah I was going to go Pee, I'll be right back....            I come out of the bathroom still on the phone with Aaron, Becca, Mom, Haven, Chandler approach me and ask where Isaiah is....I told them in the children's section, Becca takes off running toward that area Mom heads to the front, Haven informs me that There was a code Adam at Banana Republic for the area we were in...Code Adam means there was an attempted abduction.....Haven I freaked when Becca tells us that he's not back there...I ran to the Stationary section, almost in tears myself when this older Man  Woman have Isaiah at the checkout with a clerk....Isaiah was hysterical. Naturally. Then I balled too. He was lost and scared. I felt like the worst Aunt in the world. SO SCARY. He will never leave my sight again. I'm too carefree, It won't happen again especially after hearing about the kid that was almost abducted earlier in the day! How phucked up is that? SICK people.            David, Zenus,Courtney, Becca, Kristina, Michelle, Haven, Matt, Chris, Danny, Michael and I all went out clubbing lastnight, Courtney, Ian, Becca  I all had dinner together first. Fun Times. I started a tab early in the evening, when we were leaving it was nearly $200. So I basically woke up and pissed $200. THAT MAKES ME SICK. The good part is, As we were getting into the Escalade lastnight, in a puddle of water, I put my manicure in it--even, and I found a $100 bill. I initially thought it was only $10. I was going to take it to the bouncer, My brother grabbed my arm and Bruised the mohucker at that, Told me to not be so stupid and keep the money...I'm such a nerd...The Bouncer told me to keep it. Courtney told me after we let everyone out atdestination,that I told the bouncer that the money was probably Milk Money for someone's baby!!! She said I also told him that I can't take the money--I have to go to Church tommorrow and the bouncer said "He'll forgive ya, but if he don't come see me and I'll spank ya" Then he told me to call him sometime---I have no recollection of any of that being said.However I found a wet $100 bill this morning. So technically I spent $100.00 after God gave me back my money for new shoes!!!            As for my cute purchases yesterday, I bought a LV Cell Phone Wristlet, it's Spring 2004 but thats okay! I'll link you            I Bought the cutest, Sunshine colored Tube dress, A la Juicy Couture to wear to Tara's Wedding in August @ Neiman's. It's an Outdoor wedding so it's perfect. I have a pair of Sparkling, Strappy Manolo's that work perfectly. Becca Suggested I carry a Dior Clutch....we'll see. The best part is...It was under $150!!            At Bebe where I went nuts, I got the cutest Cami's ever!  urlLink http://www.bebe.com/Main/browse_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442540644FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302796658bmUID=1090185919655viewmode=page             I got it in Saphire  Willow! Super sweet  I can wear it to work  out. It would look hot with some Seven Jeans or with a cute white Paris Skirt.            I also got the prettiest lil lime skirt...it's belted...I love the fit and the way it flows. Again I can wear this out or to the office.  urlLink http://www.bebe.com/Main/browse_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442537901FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302796664bmUID=1090186545557viewmode=page             I also got a lot of cute workout tanks  pants         urlLink http://www.bebe.com/Main/browse_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442539022FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302796687bmUID=1090186659126vewmode=page                   urlLink  http://www.bebe.com/Main/browse_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442538577FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302796691bmUID=1090186804793viewmode=page       At Victoria's    Their swimsuits were on sale, Haven  I went nuts...

      ....And that means it's a day of shopping! I'm thinking Pentagon City  Tyson's Galleria II. I'm feeling some Juicy Couture I think.   Dinner was great last night. I brought Emma along. She's going to be just like me :) She's a big fan of Sushi already! I painted her fingernails and toe nails. She loved it. Almost as much as I did. I took some shots of her playing on my bed yesterday, she loves the camera. Loves to smile all the time--She melts me!  I went running yesterday after work, My neighbor who is a hot Italian (God forbid), I always thought Puerto Rican,asked if he could run with me, I was apprehensive at first, we've only chatted breifly before. He's super funny and sexy as all hell. But He's married 2 children with another on the way in August. Not shocking to me. This only proves to me what I already knew--I'm a loser magnet. He told me I could come over and swim anytime I want. "Genevieve won't mind" RIGHT. I'm all over that! He's educated and a great businessman at that. He owns several fast food chains here, Domino's Pizza being one of them. Dale Ernhardt Jr and Michael Waltrip are coming out to his business today to sign autographs and memorabilla. I told him I'd make a cameo. I probably won't.   So, the church that I attended as a child, the one I didn't agree with, The pastor's wife died. She lost her battle with Lukemia on Wednesday. She lived with it for over 15 years. It's hard to believe that she hung on that long. She's or she was rather, such a sweet lady. Always polite, proper, and sweet. I remember when I was diagnosed with AML, She came to visit and I was complaining about all of the crap I had to deal with, she studiously said, I have to take 37 different pills at breakfast, lunch  dinner. She said it with a smile. Only grateful to be living at all at that time....Her daughter, Rebecca, whom I graduated with told me that Judy didn't want to leave her grandchildren behind, she was having a hard time coping with that fact. I know that she's no longer feeling any pain at all. I know that she's comfortable and I know she will be with her grandchildren too one day. I know that right now she isn't feeling any sorrow at all. I sent a large array of flowers from my family and the Gallery. I'm actually going to go and pay my respects today before I do any shopping  I washed my car this morning, I love it when it's all clean and shiny :) It's such a super cute car. Isaiah loves it. I love it.   I've been eating poorly. I bought those damn Lemon Pastry Girl Scout Cookies and I can't stop eating the bastards!! I'm going to pour salt all over them so I won't eat them....haha  I should get going. I'm sporting some super cute Cropped Jeans by Chloe :) Gotta luv em. I'm channeling Jessica Simpson today! That is a good thing....everyone knows how super cute she is.   OH and I talked to Issaac via phone lastnight, yeah, I bailed on the girls! I loved hearing his voice. He's coming home in less than 2 weeks :) My sexy boy! I can't wait really! I'll have to add pictures to Fotki of him.   I'm listening to Beyonce's cd and I love it.   Plans for tonight include hitting up Platinum, Dream and wherever else we end up. Chris is getting us a limo....I paid for the last one, I'm not in on this one!  Gotta get going......   *Amaya*

       "Ican't   be elusive with you Honey    Cause It's blatant that I'm feeling you   And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly   Cause you're the only thing I wanna do   And it's just like Honey   When your love comes over me   Oh baby, I've got a dependancy   Always strung out for anotherTaste of your honey"         I can't stop singing that! I know it's so 1999 but I heard it yesterday and I still luv it just the same.  I got my tan on yesterday...Luv that. A new addiction that I've found. As if I need another. I'm going into the office today to get some work done, who knows where the weekend will lead me. Ian-Bradley and I are going to find him his SUV. He wants something that he can go Trail Blazing in....I suggested a Range Rover, we'll see.   I'm going out to dinner with Mom  Dad tonight, Daddy wants to go to his favorite Japanese Steakhouse, as long as I get my sushi, it's all good! Then I'm meeting up with Brandi, Haven, Payton, Courtney and Jules---We're going over to Dream, Ozio and Club Daedalus. Should be fun. Issaac's going to call tonight from Fallejuah Iraq...I may miss his call :(   Poor Jas is still a bit upset. I hate that he's so hurt but I don't know what he was expecting...All I can think about is him saying "Gonna drink some beers, try to catch a buzz, turn my radio up and forget about us." I've always been upfront with him...I told him I wasn't going to regress. I know he'll be alright...We've tried dating. It wasn't for us.I won't dwell on that.   So, I took Emma to the Circus that came to town lastnight...The workers really do give new meaning to Freaks! It costs 75 cents per person to see a white Tiger and a Panther, I gave the guy a $10 bill, and I told him I was paying for all six of us, (Ian, Isaiah, Becca, Courtney, Emma  Me) he couldn't figure out the math! He had to get someone else to give me back my change and he couldn't do it either!!! So, I basically told them it was $4.50 I owed them, they owed me $5.50, Then he didn't believe me and broke out pen  paper---TOTAL FREAKS! They all looked like freaks too, very deformed. Scary even.   The Babboon had a diaper Rash that was very disgusting...The Bengel Tiger was stir crazy and was pacing back and forth, The llamas Reeked, the Goats were gay, and the place was filthy! Isaiah who loves animals, even noticed how ridiculas it was. You could even get your picture taken while holding a baby lion...Isaiah said No Thanx to that! Again, this is all strange for him.  I'm still undecided about the weekend....Lisa wants to go down to Hotlanta. Not sure if I'm up for it. Faith is coming into town, I should atleast hang with her for a bit.   I am definetly going to Church on Sunday. I feel like I haven't been in a while because of going to Myrtle Beach this past weekend, not getting back until late Monday which means I missed Bible Study too :( BAD BAD MAYA.  Scott is going out of town for the weekend with his BROTHER! Sketchy? A lil, possibly because I don't know him that well and everyone knows I trust nobody! I have to work on that though...  I thought I was right about Micheal too. It's still hard to deal with that. I miss him so much sometimes. It drives me nuts. I always question myself too...like why did I allow myself to get hung up on him? Mostly because he fed me tons of lines all the time too. UGHHHHHHHHHHH I need to just let it freaking go!   Anyway, I am going to get to the office get some work done so I don't have to go in on Monday and then I'm going to have myself a fabulous weekend. NO WORRIES :)  :)  -Amaya

      So I decided to create a new blog. I had too many people knowing my business. It wasn't intimate anymore.   About Last Night....  Erik called me very last minute and told me that Nadia's son, Chase, was injured in an ATV accident and I have to take over her client which meant going out of town for another 3 days :( I managed to convince Monica to go :) I just got home from South Carolina, I wasn't about to go! I was relieved to say the least-Thank God for Monty :)   After I ran my usual 3 miles, I went into Harris Teeter and bought some Ben  Jerry's Carb Karma in Half Baked--SO GOOD! While in the checkout line in my workout garb, in walks 'T' whom I met a few weeks ago. Total stunner. Very handsome, has good values, established career as an Investment Banker and has just gotten out of a relationship with 'Nicole' who he consistantly tells me that I am "SO MUCH LIKE HER", I'm still not sure if thats a compliment or not. 'We're both sweet  soft spoken  gentle'--I am?!   He walked me out to my Maxx and we stood there and talked for a while when Rick Hilliard who Becca is trying to hook up with, pulled up beside us in the Envoy and he has some 16 year old bimbo affixed with a tattoo and of course the glamourous pack of Cigarettes in her hand. Lots of frizzy hair too--totally cute chic!!! Rick then came over and said hello, but I was pretty pissed at that point, the nerve! He  Becca are trying to hook up and then he brings some Juvie in public with him. Low blow, I told Becca and she said she was done. The good thing is, I know when she says that she's done, she's done!   'T' then followed me back to my house and we talked on my balcony and just chilled until 2 am. We made out like teenagers. He totally turns me on physically, although I'm not really into him otherwise :( I hate saying that but he's kinda blah.   Scott on the other hand has been extremely wonderful and has held my interest since Mannarino. He's so funny. Very sarcastic which I love. Very sweet at the same time. He likes the fact that I'm a 'Good Girl', although he's yet to see my halo!!! The best part is he has his own life aside from mine. And for Scott to help me get over Michael, he's doing good! God knows how much I cared for him. Sometimes I wonder how I fell so quickly for him. We talked about doing so much together--We wanted to do Vegas and get married for the pure hell of it! I was his keeper, We were peanut butter  jelly! I know now that he's happy and not even I could interfere with that. I always knew that he genuinely cared for her...Oh well. MOVING RIGHT ALONG!!!   My plans for the day include going to Grandma's and laying out and swim some. I promised Isaiah that he can go with me and even bring his friend. What am I getting myself into?! I invited Courtney over too we need to catch up on the wedding plans.   Haven  I are going to take her to NYC for the bachlorette party in Mid August. The date is still up in the air. Theres so much to do...Lotus of course is my hot spot. I do like Club NY too. I'm wet just thinking about it!!! Woot :)   More thoughts later....Onto to packing my beach bag!!!

      Since I updated this.  Since the 11th, a lot has happened, such as Dad's Birthday Party that was a total surprise for him.  He loved it.  It was wonderful.  Was fun for all.  I've actually considered taking a position at a Private School here.  After being cornered by my mother and giving me guilt trips about the gallery, I think that has basically been shot down.  Daddy has been supportive and has told me to do as I want and he'd support me.  I just wish Mom didn't have so much power over me...  Greg wanted to come over and spend an evening at my place, a sleepover, if you will....after discussing it with T, I decided that it wasn't a good idea after all.  He seems like a great guy and we could definetly hang out, it's just that the entire idea was a bit sketchy.   Adam  I have been in contact recently.  It's sick, but I really care for this boy.  I need to move on and leave the past where it is.  Thats so old.   Eric  I have been getting along rather well, as much as possible without ever seeing each other.   He had a date tonight with a chick to catch a flick...how cute is that?!  Scott  I haven't talked in a while...I don't know whats going on with him.  I think ever since he showed me so little interest, I think I lost taste in him.  It's sad because initially, everyone, including T, knows how much I was feeling him.  I won't give up, just yet though....  Married Mike and I talked a bit yesterday.  He went to Vegas over the weekend and partied.  He's heading to Mexico on Thursday too.  Hot trotting for sure.   I did a lot of shopping over the weekend, just enough to make me feel good...I'm fiending for more trips to the mall.  Since fall is around the corner and thats the time to really tune into the fashionista in me...Can't wait :)    Enough for now.  Maya

         Okay, okay..he text messaged me first then I called him!  He's not doing well.  Seems like he has a pyscho on his hands.               Went to the office, left early, came home  made dinner...Becca made a Pina Colada cake...the bitch.  How am I supposed to stay away from that?  What was she smoking?  She knows I devour that shtuff.                T  I talked a lot lastnight.  I was being petty and aggravating at the same time.  Poor T!  The shit he puts up with from me!  Gotta luv him for that.                Scott  I had a heart to heart lastnight.  I told him what was up.  He's always neglecting me so I had to set him straight.  He acted oblivious, but thats just what guys do.  No sweat off my back.               So I'm working on a project for Eric.  I've come to realize how much fun Mr Eric can be.  He totally gets my sense of humor now.  Whereas before I always had to break it down for him.  Everything I say  do...he loves.  For example we talked today while I was grocery shopping and I told him I didn't remember where I parked my car and that I would have to set off the panic alarm in order to hunt down my car--the guy almost busted a nut.  I like that he gets my sense of humor, however I don't want him thinking I'm a complete idiot.  I just have the beginging stages of Altzheimers!  Okay, so thats not funny.                As for Daddy's party everything is taken care of so far.  Sunday is the illumination ceremonies at the Cave, I have to be on hand to read some unimportant and useless info to a crowd of Chinese/Japanese people who don't even know what I'm saying.  Basically it's just good PR.               I'm going to take Emma outside and play for a bit.

       ~* I love weddings!  Especially hot summer weddings where the heat makes your skin glisten and you look radiant under the summer starry night sky!  When you're dolled up in the hautest Summer 2004 Bridal Couture in the perfect shade of Lavender. Yep, I live for those, and you can't forget about a haute man as your date. The kind that dresses stylishly and follows fashion trends...the kind that dances well to "TURN ME ON" by Kevin Lyttle.  The kind that wear your favorite cologne for men without even knowing it's your fave :)  Higher by DIOR.  You can't go wrong.  All of that combined equates for the perfect August evening.*~          Yesterday started off horribly.  I had to make a cameo at the local ER.  That was total fun, as you can imagine, but I didn't mind conversing with the intelligent, Oliver Peoples eyewear wearing doctors whom seem to know my own body better than Oui.  After indulging on a few hits of Morphine, interovenously of course and telling the resident Doctors that I'm a regular, that I hit the ER a couple times a weekend just for a quick pick-me-up for the Percosets and the Morphine and managing to make them believe me for a quick second even after I told them I'd already blown all of my veins due to everlasting heroin addiction...which did seem believable due to all of the bruises on my forearm because of my routine morning ritual of shooting a few cc's of insulin into my bloodstream, Dr. Gerfin did believe me for a nano-second until I managed to crack my Miss Congeniality 2000 watt smile.  I got so comfortable that I told Dr. Gerfin that I will be back next week too, only to just make him feel me up.  He lost total control over that remark and told me that I really must stop because I was making his side hurt...Of course that only lead me to tell him that I like playing Doctor too!  It was all in the game of fun.  He did a couple of name droppings of places that he frequents....I just may have to remember those.            The wedding was impecable.  Lovely. Great Music. Great Sermon/Vows even with the words "OBEY" in the vows....I personally would have to drop. Unless it is to Obey God, not my husband.            The reception was grand too.  Loved the decor, the flowers, the candles, the everything.   Tara was stunning as always. Beautiful Bride :)  Michael was a looker as well.  Total eye candy.            Now, I'm sipping on a water with lemon.  I didn't drink too much lastnight, but I still have a horrible headache, the kind that could make you pull your hair out!  Yeah, not even. Not eva.           I'm fully dressed in my best Sunday attire.  I'm going over to my grandmothers with the video camera.  Tara  Michael are showing up at 2:00, Grandma has arranged for them to leave her home in a horse  carriage and head to the Victorian in that.  How cute is that?!  It's the perfect afternoon for a carriage ride.            Mom, the lady who told me this morning that I wasn't nice--is ready and is standing at the top of my staircase yelling for me.  I feel like a child.  A child with boobs.  A child playing dress up in heels, with boobs.  I need to wear this dress more often.  I suddenly feel fullfilled.            I'm off to see the wizard...

       Ugh, Holy Hell!  I woke up in excrutiating pain this morning.  Yesterday, the same thing.  It's my sides...they're killing me.        I have a headache from hell too.  I'm going to go to the hospital before my hair appt. at 4:00.  I took 4 advil and that's eased the pain, on a scale of 1-10, I'm at a 7 right now, whereas earlier I was an 11.        The wedding is today and this is a great day to feel like all hell.        Update later...probably tommorrow.

        However, I'm not :)   Today was Mom's birthday.  I knew her birthday was August 5th, but it never crossed my mind today.  Dad  Mom showed up early at my house this morning, Dad asked what we had planned for Mom...confused at first until it dawned on me that TA DA!  Today's Mom's Birthday!!!            Dad was furious, but Becca, Haven, Ian  saved the day.  While Dad took Mom to play golf, I called everyone and made the arrangements. We all had dinner, caught up, and I even had a glass of white wine.  I knew I shouldn't simply because of the carbs,           We all chipped in for a Day Spa certificate and a Hermes scarf.  She adored it.  She asked for a freaking salad spinner and thats exactly what dad bought her!  Gay.           In other news,  I toured the Country Club today. Thats where I intend to host Mom  Dad's Birthday party.  I just have to cut the guest list in half.  That will be hard. We're at 102 now.  Including drinks, the dinner is @ $25 per head...which is sensible considering all the options and it includes the dinner wine, the cocktails, beers etc....Now, the hard part is up to me.  I get to cut the guests.  Fun fun.  I somehow always get stuck with the coolest job.                 I think that Eric is becoming interested in me. He confessed that he read the journal too.  Thats great.  Invade my life, please! Again, Thanx!          Scott called me at 1:00 this a.m.  I didn't answer.  I crashed early.  I just want him to persue me a bit.  If he is infact interested I'll be able to tell.  His signals are too weird and hard to read.            T  Nicole talked.  All I can say is (BECAUSE HE READS THIS)  is that it's about damn time.  They didn't get very far.  Except she knows exactly what he's feeling and I just hope for his sake that she doesn't take his vulrenablity for granted.  I think he'd give anything to have her back.  Special prayers for T, for sure.           I thought of Broke Ass today, as always.  I realize now that everything that happend was a part of God's plan and he intended for us to cross paths.  I just can't wait until his face stops haunting me.  I can't wait until that day comes that I say Broke Ass who?!!!  I want to get over him so bad.  I know he never thinks about me,  I know that he doesn't spend this much time focusing on me so why do I do it for him?  I don't want to talk bad about him, he just simply was in love with HER...even after all the shit he said.  Did he really think it though?  Or was he really angry?  Who knows.  Why do I care?          Weekend plans include:  Wedding Rehearsel tommorrow then partying later with Miss B Haven...Saturday, Wedding madness, then ass shaking all night :)  Sunday is an afternoon tea for Tara  Michael.  My grandmother is hosting it.  Should be fun.  Grandma has great taste and always provides the best Raspberry Scones :)  Ooops, CARBS--FUCKERS.            I didn't run again today, I've been too busy.  TOMMOROW for sure.            Going to bed now....God Bless.      ~A

       It's midnight and I'm just getting around to updating my journal.  I just got home...      I went to the office today and took care of lots of dreaded paper work.  I was there all alone for most of the day.        I got a Brazillian today.  Josephina hooked me up.  She knows my pootie inside  out.  She don't miss a beat!  Whats bad is walking out after the waxing...PAINFUL.       Mom, Dad, Missy, Eric, Emma came over for dinner.  Mom cooked Mexican for everyone.  I had a low carb Mexican night.  Chicken tacos are tasty.  I could think of better foods, but better foods are loaded with carbs.  This will have to work until I'm satisfied.        I walked through my door this evening and Emma went nuts.  She wouldn't let go of me.  Becca said that she was yelling my name all evening :)  Doesn't that just make your day??        I'm tired. Like always.  I think it's going to be a shopping day for me tommorrow.  We'll see.        Off to dreamland...........

      Today went well.  I didn't do much of anything. I did get an increadibly sweet email from someone--Came out of nowhere!  I was touched, to say the least.   Snippet:   So I guess what I'm trying to say in this message is that I'm sorry for actinglike a one-dimensional jerk.  I pride myself as someone who can offer more to someone than just one aspect of his life.  I obviously have not proven this toyou so far.  I like you for so many reasons... your charismatic, your sense of humor is amazing, I find you incredibly attractive,you have an ability to surprise me where most people cannot, your sensitive without being over-sensitive and your confidence without coming across like a snob are just a few reasons that come to mind right away.  However, most of all I like you b/c you're genuine.  It's the most underrated characteristic intoday's world.  It's a quality that doesn't come to you overnight, it developsfrom the time we come into existence and not everyone has it but fortunately,you're one that possesses it.      How can I not smile to that?!   I got my tan on today.  My body is warm now.  Feels good.  I met up with Rebecca  Elizabeth for coffee at Starbucks.  I met 'Caleno' there.  I think he's Italian not sure... He gave me his number, but being my brilliant self,  I left the number on the table!  Very rude, I know.  I could have put it to good use, but oh well.   T  I are on day 2 of Zippy carbs.  I'm going strong.  I haven't gotten an update on him yet.  We have to stay in contact, he motivates my ass!   Things to do tommorrow: ~Pick-up dry cleaning ~Return calls, tons even ~Do paper work, contracts, invoices, etc. ~Call Brandi ~Narrow down the dates to Tara's wedding...IMPORTANT   I"m going to bed now!  Thuper Tired :)   Amaya

        Today was the funeral and it goes without saying how devastatingly painful it was for the entire family.  Kat is just nuts. Hearing her scream "Don't leave me, don't let them take my baby" left me sobbing aloud. Her heart is broken.  She's a beautiful strong woman and to see her down on her knees and in pain, it kills me.  I pray she'll be okay.  She has her boys, Logan  Ethan and they will help her get out of bed every morning and take on the world.  I'll keep praying for strength.  There was over 100 people in attendance, there were people standing in the Vestibul (SP), he was loved by many thats for sure.  But finally he's no longer in pain and he's at peace. If he could come back to earth, I'm sure he wouldn't want to.  Gosh, I can't believe he's gone though.  I just realized that. He is gone.  Wow. What happens next? Nothing will ever be the same.  What happens at Christmas? Holidays? Just wow.            It all brings back the painful day in January of 2000.  A day I'll never forget.  I still remember the music, I still listen to it occasionally.  It keeps me grounded.  I sure do miss him.  Everyday. All day.  Everyday I shed a tear for him and I wonder if I'll ever get over that? He's watching over us now though...     "When my life is almost gone, hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand, l'est I fall"            ---------------------------     On to something else...          Damn you, Induction!!!            So, T  I have decided to do a ketonic diet.  We're staying under 20 carbs per day. It's basically the Atkins Diet.  We're going to work out fiercely too :)  200-400 sit ups a day along with a protein shake or 2 ;)            Today has been rather easy, simply because I've been so busy...I did infact have lunch, I'm such a nerd.  Today has been a complete blur and it's definetly been a long one.            I had a big grilled chicken salad with Blue Cheese dressing for dinner and it was rather fullfilling.            I'm estimating that my total carb intake, WITH lunch is about 15 Carbs.      I've had three 33 oz.s of water.  The water is good for my skin too.  Love water lots.  Gotta have the water.           Things to do tommorrow:     ~Amber's Scrapbooking party @ 6:00     ~Quick meeting with Qyweneth @ Allison     ~Mani  Pedi, maybe--no appt yet.     ~A lunch date with my Aunt Carmen          My day isn't going to be busy at all, Thank God!          We're making the plans for Courtney's Bachlorette Party in NYC, Can't wait.          This weekend is Tara  Michael's wedding.  Our dresses are super cute.  She's doing Pastel Colors, I'm in lavender.  I love my dress too!           The following weekend is Daddy's party.  He has no idea yet :)  Total Surprise          I've been dreaming of my wedding since I was 10!  Of course the color theme will be all different shades of Pink...from a Blush to a Mauve to a Coral.  Flowers will be white Roses with some diamonds in the bouquet. I want a summer wedding, on the beach...at Sunset, no shoes, and I want the waves to crash at our feet...You can say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one!           Highlight of the day: Seeing all my family! Love my family :)           T emailed me this: "amaya, you're my inspiration" How sweet is that?  This guy is a total cupcake.  So sweet.           Time to get into my jammies :)               Thanx for all the sweet IM's, Emails and Prayers, everybody!  God Bless you all!!!          ~*Amaya *~                    amaya, you're my inspiration
