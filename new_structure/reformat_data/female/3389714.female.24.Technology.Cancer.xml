      Woke up today at 6:30am .. fully restedâ¦it been a long time since I got decent sleep.. I think it was all the craziness from the previous few days that finally took a toll on me..but feel I like a million bucks today.. woke up... walk downstairs to find the whole family sitting around the kitchen table enjoying breakfast onâ¦ yes u got it on âa bloody WEEKDAYâ it was odd.. but niceâ¦ mom had to go to work late today ..so she thought with dadâs leg and all sheâll treat us all to a warm breakfast..I honestly hate stuffing my face with cold corn flakes in the morning ..and oatmeal is out of the question it taste like mushed blob to me â¦however, I passed on the breakfast ..and negotiated my way to making dad iron my khakis.  It worked.. I despise ironing ..i donât mind washing clothes or folding them just hate ironing .. oh well .. trotted back upstairs and bushed my teeth..took a warm shower today ..had to wash hairâ¦decided to give it a quick blow dry and headed downstairs to pick up my perfectly ironed trousers..mom managed to give a quick yet extremely loud shout stating I was once again drippin on her carpetâ¦I swear I wasnât..I just think she enjoys clearing her throat every morning by yelling at me ..lets just call it her throat exerciseâ¦..Due to todayâs unruly weather of humidity and rain..i decided to wear my new tennis jacket with a white tankie.. I actually looked good on me ..wow ..i successfully dressed myself today..yippie.. anyways was havin a awesome hair day ..and I defiantly started the day off with a positive note.. made 2 sandwiches and decided that Iâll get to work on time today..i opened the side door to see momâs mini-van blockin my car..yell for momâ¦like usual she was admiring her non-existent garden in the backyard..in which she recently planted seeds..she managed to pull her van out for me ... to now make a quick dash to workâ¦once again did not break record time of 3 min..hit 2 traffic lights..moving forward..got to work on time ..and decided to read emails and savor the silence of an empty office over a cup of tazo chai latteâ¦it was greatâ¦ wrote a few emails here and there..and my director emailed me cuz he wanted to consult me on creating a tag line for an online dictory..i was shocked ..i was never the marketing kind..i emailed him my 2 cents..hopefully heâll like it .. did some research on cicadas yesterday ..i know that their hitting the jerzy area ..and Iâm totally freakedâ¦I hate those little f*ckersâ¦ I mean they come by the millions, and they shed their exoskeletons all over the place then they mate and bloody die ..yah it's a great life ..but hey their so damn messy..and absolutely gross..they're hideously ugly and a total freak of nature if u ask me â¦ I mean if we were goin to be mobbed by pretty butterflies I donât mind..but these boogers look like a mutated mosquitoes .. damn grossâ¦ oh well if yah all are interested in reading up on cicadas you can go to http://cicadamania.com . anyways wow did u watch American idol last night I managed to get in the last 5 min.. I was a bit upset I had my heart set on Diana .. oh well..same thing happened to me last season..i had my heart sent on Clay..and they year before on Justinâ¦oh well I guess I donât ever agree with the rest of America.. umm .. Had an interesting convo with a friend last night it was quite refreshing.. we talked about the activities I was in during my High Schools days ..it was fun walkin down memory lane.. enjoyed it â¦Thanks P..anyways better get back to workâ¦talk to yah all tomorrowâ¦tata..

      Yesterday was a rough dayâ¦felt extremely stress and tiredâ¦ woke up with a weird feeling that today was not goin to be a pleasant dayâ¦ Hadenât really touched the editing on the user manualâ¦ finished stat analysis and then got assigned a crazy yet tedious projectâ¦ I didnât mind.. just hated the fact that it was complicatedâ¦ I mean you had to check then double check then check once more to make sure u did it rightâ¦ I hate projects like thatâ¦ they make u question yourself and the way u thinkâ¦ I guess it sort of like when u leave to go to work and when u down the street you get the notion that u left the door unlockedâ¦so u make a U-turn and go back home to checkâ¦u quickly turn the handle and Yep it lockedâ¦then u dodge back to your car so u wonât be late to work againâ¦then when u sit down at your desk..u get that feeling again..where u wish u turned the door knob both ways and gave the door a push..just to make sure it was lockedâ¦ Itâs a weird sort of paranoiaâ¦ oh wellâ¦after workâ¦went home ..had to go to the library but got lazy and headed homeâ¦dad was sitting on the couch with his leg up on the coffee table â¦ I sort of felt badâ¦ but I think it will do him some good to sit and relaxâ¦ heâs never relaxed and chilled for as long as I can remember .. heâs like a worker antâ¦ canât sit still.. anywaysâ¦ Had a god awful night last night.. sleeping was out of the question.. my mind was working overtime.. and I was beyond upset.. I donât know yâ¦ I was up talking to friends till midnightâ¦ and had a blastâ¦once I hung up the phone .. I decided to wash up for bed â¦ came back to my room and got this sense of pure loneliness.. it was the worst feeling everâ¦ I didnât know what to do.. didnât want to cry didnât want to mope around feeling sorry for myselfâ¦ seeing the room that I resided in made me feel that I lost myself in the past few years â¦ I got into bed and attempted to think about happy thoughts.. but I couldnât .. just couldnât shake that lonely feeling â¦ then I thought Iâd think of names of all the people that really luved me .. I could only at the time name one .. GOD.. it was scary I know that thereâs a lot of people out there that Iâd like to think give a damn about me ... but my mind froze .. I began to think does god luv me .. I donât even know him..never met him..yet I think he luvs me .. yah I know I was at my all time low .. perhaps itâs life takin its weird toll .. I need a serious vacationâ¦ Been stressed a lot .. it hard adjusting to change .. it can seriously do a number on you â¦ Iâve decided from this point on Iâm goin to make an extra effort telling my family and friends that I luv them..sometimes only actions donât count ..i think sometimes people need to HEAR that they are luved â¦ I know that I surely doâ¦   Something to think about: When was the last time someone told u they luved u .. and u felt warm inside..u believed it ..it wasnât just to be nice .. when was that last time?  PS: i'm seriously craving ... green skittles ... yummy...

      Itâs 8:40 got me some teaâ¦read my emailsâ¦and it looks like it goin to be a slow yet extremely boring dayâ¦been doing a lot of thinking lately about life and all â¦itâs odd how your past shapes your futureâ¦I noticed that I actually luved my High School years, but hated my college years.  Donât get me wrong, I had my friends and a good share of men in my life while I was in collegeâ¦Itâs just that now when I look back at it â¦ I donât think I enjoyed itâ¦I mean in college it was all at my disposal â¦ I lived on campus, didnât have mom and dad breathing down my backâ¦ the guy girl ratio was 14 to 1â¦ I mean hello 14 guys to every girl ..yah it was niceâ¦ I feel as if I cheated myself â¦ early on during my freshmen and sophomore years I tended to date cuz.. hey he was hotâ¦ had a nice smile ..gorgeous hair.. I know I was extremely shady.. but Iâm sure those guys only dated me cuz of my physical characteristics â¦ Which I do not pose anymore .. and have lost hope of posing â¦ I mean size 4 jeans â¦ Iâd be glad if I can stick one butt cheek into that now.. I mean I guess I was pretty popular in college I once had a friend tell me âevery girl wants to be you and every guy wants to nail youâ .. I laughed it offâ¦whatever .. We were so immature back thenâ¦ In college everything was about â¦who slept with who, and what the hottest club was, and how much lick can one hold with out totally vomiting .. And high school was about ice cream parlors and roller skating rings and who had their 1st kiss with whoâ¦ I guess once you through with college and start working u loose your sense of havin fun..i mean I think I did .. now life is about when I can make time to do laundry, or vacuum, or take the car for an oil change â¦  I noticed I need to make an effort just to keep in touch with friends I mean in high school and college I took them for granted â¦ They were always thereâ¦ Currently .. lets just say all my friends have lives and I ..well I think doing laundry on a weekday rather then the traditional weekend is mucho excitingâ¦ Yah .. I truly need a MAN â¦ I donât know when I hit rock bottom â¦ I mean in college there was always a guyâ¦ hell I had backupsâ¦ nowâ¦it become so hard .. I assume it cuz ..back then I dated to have a good timeâ¦ go out to dinner, go dancing and then Iâd go back to my place and heâd go back to his place and weâd call it a nightâ¦ there was no real pressure.. NOW!!!..u got mom breathing down your back stating that you need to get married .. and grandma constantly b*itchinâ¦ informing me that Iâm goin to be 24 soon and that Iâm still stupidly single.. I guess now Iâm not looking for a boyfriend anymore but rather a HUSBANDâ¦I know sounds scary..but hey I have an excuse â¦ Iâm single cuz Iâm out lookin for a man whoâs marriage materialâ¦this sucks â¦think Iâm goin to go back to my tea it's 9:06 and i'm here till 4:30 ish..gonna be a long *ss dayâ¦ talk to ya all tomorrowâ¦   Something to Think About: I like my coffee black but drink my tea with cream and sugarâ¦isnât that a bit oddâ¦ Wonder if that hot guy from the sister company is around todayâ¦he did have a cute buttâ¦OK I admit Iâm a butt girl .. I think a manâs butt has a lot to say about himâ¦yupâ¦nice buttâ¦sweetâ¦

I managed to get in a WHY? in between all her senseless babbleâ¦ She managed to calm herself down to tell me that I needed to take my dad to the hospitalâ¦I was baffled ..i mean dad and hospital in the same sentence..my dadâs like superman..he can withstand any kind of painâ¦I was shocked..mom told me he didnât sleep all night..and he was feeling awful todayâ¦basically what happened was Sunday afternoonâ¦my dad and broâ¦decided to be macho and install a built in A/C unit all by themselvesâ¦mom and I did not take much concern to their project due to the fact that they always do stuff around the house..and with dad being an architectâ¦mom and I assumed that he must now a thing or twoâ¦so we decided to go to PA and hit the mallâ¦We came home around 7ish to find a stretch band-aid around dadâs right footâ¦dad said it was a minor sprain and we ignored it and gave the man two aspirinsâ¦Anyways, mom decided that now she will take dad to hospital and that I should go to pick him upâ¦when he callsâ¦so dad called and I went to pick him up..he stated that he had a fracture in his leg..i didnât know what to say ..other then ok what next..he stated we need to go to the out patient ward to pick up x-rays and then head to an orthopedic surgeonâs officeâ¦we went to Dr. Tanâsâ¦to find out that he will be in at 1..we got an appointment at 1:30 and headed homeâ¦dad called up his work and told them that he will not be in today..i called up my work and told them Iâd be in before 4..it odd how ppls at my work are so considerate about dadâs condition ..while dadâs boss and co-workers started stressing..i guess he had many solo projects he was working onâ¦ I ended up watching TV for about and hour and a half then had lunch..took dad to the orthopedic surgeons office..to got a plaster cast put on his legâ¦it was odd having a another person give dad instructions on how he should go about living life for the next few weeks..Dad never listens to anyoneâ¦anyways dropped dad at home and I rushed to work..didnât break the record of 3 min..i hit 2 traffic lights..damn..oh wellâ¦got to work everyone was like howâs dad?..i stated fine ..and went on my businessâ¦I had to do stat analysis on last weeks activities however wrong reports were given to me..gotta go back and tell sister company to run stats againâ¦ Iâm not having a bright dayâ¦oh wellâ¦gotta get back to work..hopefully this is how bad it get..canât picture any more chaos in my lifeâ¦lets c itâs only 4:21 pm.    New Development: Saw a new guy that must have been just hired at our sister companyâ¦and let me tell u he is damn yummyâ¦mmm' mmmm' good!

      Yesterday was an awful day at work..nearly died of boredomâ¦got very little doneâ¦however today got a meeting with the director hopefully this new project will be excitingâ¦it oddâ¦when Iâm given project I work on it nonstop..till it gets done..then once itâs done..well I got nuthin to doâ¦god Iâm a wackoâ¦Iâm excited about this Chase projectâ¦hopefully Iâll get to meet new and interesting peopleâ¦wokeup really early today â¦ donât know yâ¦ couldnât sleepâ¦lied in bed thinking..about the silliest things..got out of bed around 9:30â¦brushed teethâ¦and headed downstairs to find a note written by dad in his neatest handwriting ..informing me that I once again forgot to put dishes in the dishwasher..iâm not goin to complain ..it was my fault that I forgot.. decided to make breakfast and started rising off the leftovers on the dirty dishes and made a neat pile on the counter â¦ then turned on dawsonâs creek at 10:00 â¦god Iâm bloody addicted to those reruns.. I guess that truly shows I have no life.. managed to wash down breakfast with a glass of OJ while watchin adolescent at it best on TBSâ¦headed to the kitchen to placed dishes in dishwasher â¦ walked upstairs and took cold shower .. had to wash hairâ¦ listen to Z100 while getting dressedâ¦ I wonder what itâs like to be a radio personalityâ¦ must be amazing.. those guys never run out of things to say..or never have awkward silences with their audiences .. I donât think I could ever be a radio personalityâ¦ decided to blow dry hair didnât want it to turn into a frizzy messâ¦and threw on some clean clothes and headed out the doorâ¦to find out that empty garbage cans are blocking the entrance of the driveway â¦ placed garbage cans on front lawn and rushed out of the driveway .. I broke my record time by takin 3 min to drive to workâ¦ Iâm quite please with myself â¦ walked into work say hi to co worker â¦ log onto computer and start reading emails â¦ today canât be as bad as yesterday.. so I think Iâll start today off with a smileâ¦: )  Thought for the Mind: When a friend hurts your feelings or u get a notion that they are degrading you..what should u do?â¦ I would take out the time to just relax think things through .. go over what happened â¦ Itâs a matter of saying sorry and then replayin by saying âitâs ok .. I forgive youâ ..  but itâs up to u whether u want to forgive that someoneâ¦ I tend to always forgive and that is my weakness .. I need to go to sleep at night knowing that I did not hurt anyoneâs feelings â¦ if someone is hurting then u should know that they are truly sorry â¦ u just need to be careful that they donât hurt u againâ¦next time Iâll keep my eyes openâ¦

      People in this world are so cruel ..i hate them all..people always point out your flaws..when u wouldnât dare point out theirsâ¦ I hate thatâ¦ actually not only do I hate it ..but it hurtsâ¦itâs like a bloody dagger going through your heartâ¦ I donât need people to directly tell me I suckâ¦but whatâs worse is that people I think luv me indirectly tell me I suck even more.. take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and face realityâ¦ Iâm sure you will find flaws that u wish u never had.. listen god's a cruel beingâ¦ he made sure that no one he created was perfectâ¦ even hritick roshan has a flaw ..with is extra thumbâ¦ so stop judging people on their flaws and look inside them â¦Iâm sure they have a heart and some luv to offer uâ¦    Question of the Day:  How did u feel when someone pointed out your flaws?  I felt like a piece of 3rd world shit suffocating underneath someoneâs old smelly bata chapels.

      Thereâs not a lot of things that irk meâ¦however today while riding up 11 floors in a claustrophobic elevator I saw a women in her late 50âs wearing a pair of black silk pants that rode up her *ssâ¦it drove me nuts â¦I wanted tap her shoulder and ask her to go home and change her pants to spare her co-workers from having chronic nightmares.  Well, due to this unprecedented event that took place I decided to make a list of   things that irk me:   Things Women Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) They wear lipstick outside their lips 2) When anorexic-ly thin women at the gym complain that âI still need to loose 10 poundsâ   3) They wear high heels but donât know how to walk in them 4) They wear pants that ride up their butts   5) They wear a bra thatâs 3 sizes too small so it looks as if they have a uni-boob    Things Men Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) When they try to see who can burp the loudest and longest 2) When they wear their pants so low that we are forced to look at their chunky hairy *sses every time they bend over. 3) When they ask if you had an orgasm after s*xâ¦ âHello, we never do ..we just fake it ..all the bloody timeâ 4) When they make a puppy dog face and pour fake tears out of their eyes when you inform them that âYes, your wee wee is a bit too smallâ 5) When they ask you if  âTHEYâ are realâ¦âHello, they are always realâ¦even if theyâre fakeâ  Well hereâs my list ..feel free to leave a comment on what drives you nuts:

      I havenât really relaxed or un-winded in a very long time .. Iâm always thinking or worried about something or someone ..but this weekend I wanted to be selfish and take care of myselfâ¦on Saturday I went to the gym ..and then hit the park with my sisterâ¦I parked the car under a tree and opened all the windows and read .. yah u got it I read for about 2 hours straight ..it was greatâ¦the cool breeze getting tangled within my hair ..and the soft chirping of baby birds in the trees aboveâ¦it was the most amazing feeling ..it was just me and the worldâ¦ I think Iâm going to do this every weekend .. I enjoy it thoroughly ..plus itâs about time I manage my time usefullyâ¦ On Sundayâ¦I decided to go shopping I had a whole list of things to getâ¦however when I hit the store all the items on my list appeared to be beyond ugly on the display shelfâ¦so I ended up coming home with 2 disc-mansâ¦one for me and another for my brotherâ¦ during my time at the store my buddy C-man called about 2 to 3 times â¦ he was having issues picking out presents for his parentsâ¦ I guess I know where heâs coming from I never know what to get my parents â¦ at times old people have such complicated taste ..or else very high expectationsâ¦ to top of my wonderful weekend Doctor P called and he quizzed me on my sports teams and the cities they were from ..iâm not really a huge baseball, football, basketball, or hockey fan ..but I was surprised that I knew so many teams from all sorts of citiesâ¦ I think Doctor P was a bit surprised at my sports trivial knowledgeâ¦soon after Doctor P and I started practicing my guju in a very unusual mannerâ¦ My gujarati sucks.. I speak so poorly and have no idea how to conjugate verbsâ¦ I think the Doctor got a good laugh listening to me sound like an *ss but hey .. at least Iâm trying to get betterâ¦Iâm excited today Dr. P and I are going to go over colors and fruits in gujuâ¦yippieâ¦ mu thanna maaru?â¦    Question of the Dayâ¦   If you can bite anyone anywhere where would u bite themâ¦?   I would bite someone on their shoulder itâs the perfect shape ..it will fit perfectly in oneâs mouth once they open their jaws very wideâ¦so u all out there wear extra shoulder pads ..cuz I might just bite uâ¦yummyâ¦

      Woke up today with yesterdays headacheâ¦stayed in bed for an extra Â½ hour â¦ hoping my body would cooperateâ¦ however it didnât .. so I got up and took a cold showerâ¦ got dress called Doctor P to make sure he got upâ¦ lately I feel as if I am getting up on time how ever the rest of the world isnât â¦and itâs my mission in life to give them a wake up callâ¦well soon after I hung upâ¦I got dressed and jetted out the door to see I was about 10 min ahead of schedule ..which in my case never happensâ¦ so I decided to grab some breakfast to goâ¦I desperately needed coffee ..holy hazelnut coffee that would perform an exorcism on my body and banish the throbbing in my craniumâ¦..so I broke again ..but with out coffee Iâm totally delusional and dysfunctionalâ¦so go ahead bite meâ¦   Question of the Day:  Are you ticklious? ..if yes ...where are u the most tickliousâ¦?  Iâm extremely ticklious..and I tend to laugh chronically till streams of tears pour down my faceâ¦Iâm most ticklious on the soles of my feet and the sides of my neck.

      Itâs 5:22 pmâ¦and I just had to get myself away from my desk ..i was nodding offâ¦ I have a slight headache from disobeying my natural sense of sleep ..didnât sleep well last night ..my mind would not stop thinkingâ¦it was going as fast as the express Amtrak train from Newark Penn Station to Union Station in DCâ¦However there was nothing that could intervene the daily routine that this train tookâ¦unlike meâ¦Iâm at work falling asleep due to boredom I supposeâ¦ the weather is gorgeous outside and the air is fresh..iâm locked up in a high-rise where I breath in artificial air that the air conditioning is pounding out vigorouslyâ¦ I needed to save myself from my own natural subconsciousâ¦I grab an ice cold water bottle from the soda machine ..thinking the coldness of the fake spring water will drive my sleep awayâ¦ the water is cold and crisp in my mouth and my tongue shied  awayâ¦ however the sleep was reluctant to leave my body ...I still had another 2 and a half hours to goâ¦ I was trying to focus on my monitor hoping to see if I had received mail, however I hadnât ..right then the phone on my desk rangâ¦ my phone never ringsâ¦ I havenât really given anyone my numberâ¦I picked up the phone and a women was talking about some make-up product ..I told her we do not sell make-up and we offer financial softwareâ¦ she was extremely rude and kept yellingâ¦my head was about to split wide open â¦the pain was so intense â¦I could almost picture my brains pouring out of my skull as if someone had poured to much spaghetti in a bowl and the noodles would pour out as if a violent volcano had erupted â¦finally she asked if this was 1-800-xxx-xxxxâ¦I said no ..she ended off saying âGod Damnâ and hung up before I could say âByeââ¦I think that did itâ¦ my eyelids are not playing tug of war with my brain..and my pupils have obeyed to adjust to the light setting..however the headache just got worseâ¦perhaps Iâll go straight to bed after dinnerâ¦hopefully Iâll get some desperately needed sleepâ¦

      Recently I was told by a friend that I drink too much coffeeâ¦Iâm not a caffeine addict, due to the fact that I hardly drink soda and never took caffeine pills to stay awake during finals.  There are 2 reasons that lead me to drink: 1) to wake me up in the morning 2) cuz itâs cold in my building.  I decided that drinking on an average 4 to 5 cups of coffee is well not all that healthy, and wanted to do something about it.  Tea was my solutionâ¦I went and bought all sorts of decaf teaâ¦  It was not badâ¦ Iâd have numerous cups of tea though out the day and never felt guiltyâ¦ until todayâ¦  I was up all night talking to my S mama (uncle),  I adore him and heâs really awesome for a 30 year old â¦I havenât been a good niece lately cuz I donât really make an effort keeping in touchâ¦but yesterday we talked for an hour and a halfâ¦till 3:30 in the morningâ¦ keep in mind that I needed to wake up at 6 to get to workâ¦ The alarm rang at 6:00am precisely and I proceeded on fulfilling my daily morning ritual of cleaning one self and getting one dressedâ¦before long I found myself sitting at my desk in intense painâ¦ my head was killing meâ¦. It felt as if I partied hard and had a bit too many everclear jello shotsâ¦was I hung over from having a conversation with my favorite uncleâ¦it obviously is not a good reason to have this massive headacheâ¦so I decided to drink a cup of tea â¦nothing happenedâ¦took a pill â¦still nothingâ¦then proceeded to go to the cafÃ© and get a cup of coffee â¦ took one sip and I was curedâ¦ the headache was gone ..and so was the nausea â¦ I believe itâs all mentalâ¦ but heyâ¦ I tried and I brokeâ¦ I luv coffee and Iâll find a way of getting it into my system by all sorts of means including: a) oral application b) anal submission c) snorting though the nose and d) injecting though needles â¦nah Iâm just kiddingâ¦I tend to eat these coffee by-productsâ¦.1) coffee flavored ice cream 2) coffee flavored chocolates 3) coffee cake 4) coffee milkshakes, ectâ¦.what can I say I LUV COFFEE!!!!  Question of the Day:  If you were dared or promised a huge lump sum of money would you ever kiss a person of the same sex?  I think I would.. itâs just a kissâ¦however I would mind if the person being kissed was not straightâ¦then I would notâ¦cuz then it would just be full blown creepyâ¦ewww

      Okâ¦ for the people who know me and have seen me before know that I have short jet black super straight hairâ¦ however, Iâve noticed that humid weather really feeds my hair unrulinessâ¦ itâs not only frizzy but it starts doing this wavy thingâ¦ just like the way old Indian actresses used to keep their hair in black and white moviesâ¦ anyways my solution to this unruliness was a straightening ironâ¦ it works pretty well on my hair without doing any major damage... Iâll keep the iron on very low heat and quickly slide my hair though it .. my whole freaking head only takes about 2 to 3 minutes to di-frizzâ¦  so due to my luck today.. not only was it the most HUMID day ever â¦it was raining like a skanky sridevi rain dance videoâ¦the only thing missing was me in a see though tight *ss sari â¦non-stop pouring rain.. to top it off â¦it was my sister 8th grade graduation ..which I was already 15 min late forâ¦  I ran out of the shower and got dressed to see that my hair had a life of itâs own.. I then quickly proceeded to turning on the hair iron and finished getting dressedâ¦ I propped myself down in front of the full body length mirror and started my usual hair straightening exercise ..however it was odd the iron wasnât warm ..i turned the knob all the way to full heatâ¦ and nothing happenedâ¦ the stupid thing was broken..  I ran out the door and rushed to my sister middle school with my afro like hairâ¦ and you will not believe who came to greet me at the doorâ¦ an ex-co-worker.. I was so embarrassedâ¦ she said hi and asked it I got a perm ..i laughed and said bad hair day.. soon after my sister received her 2 dollar cheap paper diploma ..i rushed to the hair solon to pick up another iron.. this time I was smart and got the one that had a 2 year manufacturerâs warrantyâ¦ I wasnât playing games.. so it turns out the new iron is amazing ..and now guess whoâs having an awesome hair dayâ¦ ME!!!!   Question of the Day: Which is sexier ..sari or a bikini?  I think a sari is sexierâ¦cuz it leave a lot more to the human imaginationâ¦

      I had a pretty decent weekend.. it was the usualâ¦ chaosâ¦ nothing newâ¦ I decided that form now onwards ..iâm going to make alone time for myself.. thatâs where I spend a few hour to treat myself once a week.. like on Sunday.. I grabbed some low fat coffee mocha chip ice cream and bought the book dimpsey recommended âholy cowâ by sarah macdonald..and hit the parkâ¦ I sat in my car with the windows wide openâ¦ and just readâ¦ it was a great feeling there was no one to bother me or scream my name as if I had just ran over a dogâ¦ no mom judging my every move ..and dad was not in sightâ¦ it was a great feeling for 2 hours I actually thought I was special ..and didnât have a care in the world â¦ itâs been a very long time since I felt this way..my life is so inter-twined with my parentsâ and siblingsâ that Iâve truly lost myself.. I had forgotten what really makes me happyâ¦a book and an ice cream coneâ¦ I told ya all Iâm not high-maintenance â¦   Question of the Day:  Why is it that I have no problem watching 2 guys make out but get a bit freaked when 2 girls go full throttle?

      Ok check this outâ¦I think luck is totally playing on my side todayâ¦woke up at 8:00â¦ had to take ba (grandmother) back to Hobokenâ¦I had work at 12 so I didnât care diving her back home..however she mentioned that she needed to go to the bank so I was like âIâll drive you..no need to walk in the heatâ..she was grateful and I dropped her off at the bank and doubled parked on Washington streetâ¦for all you guys who donât know â¦I was born in Hoboken..right near the Hudson riverâ¦over looking the new york skyline..itâs a great place ..mostly a college town and now there a growing breed of young professional living there as well..while I was dazing off into space sitting in the car waiting for ba..I noticed it..a small bagel shop..i was shocked...it had the same sign, windows and doorsâ¦as I remembered ..G masi used to take me there when I was no older then 6â¦she used to hold my hand and ask me what bagel I wantedâ¦Iâd always say cinnamon raisin ..but I wanted the bagel with the most raisinsâ¦G masi and the store owner used to laugh and heâd go to the basket filled with cinnamon raisin bagels and pull out the one with the most raisins ..and place a bit of cream cheese on itâ¦weâd take the bagels to the park where Iâd play with the pigeons ..and G masi used to feed me .. I remember having a cream cheese mustache ..and running away when G masi tried to wipe it off..haha..now Iâd die of embarrassment if I was caught in public with cream cheese pasted on my faceâ¦weâll I left my car double parked and prayed I didnât get ticketed and ran into the bagel shopâ¦the owner had aged dramaticallyâ¦but still had that quirky smileâ¦ he asked me what I wanted..and once again I said âcinnamon raisin bagel with tons of raisins lightly toasted with a bit of cream cheeseâ he smiled at me and started digging though his basketâ¦Iâm utterly happy today and I thank that bagel shop on Washington street for putting a smile of my faceâ¦MUHAAAâ¦   Question of the Day:   How do you like your bagel? (toasted, butter, cream cheese, jelly)

      I only went to India once in my life when I was 13 .. I was born and raised in New Jersey, USA.  Iâm your typical ABCD that will never understand anything typical desiâ¦I remember sitting in a 15 passenger van with various family members wearing sariâs and dothiâs â¦ I was told we were going to visit my dadâs house in some remote village in Gujarat.. Mom told me dad had a great big farm with cows and buffalos .. I was soo excitedâ¦I thought it would be a bit like Little House on the Prairie â¦ god damn was I wrong..in his little village the roads were not paved and there was cow droppings everywhereâ¦and everyone spoke a different launague..mom said it was guju ..but it was a different dialect that we were used toâ¦ but she stated I could manage if I told family members to talk slowlyâ¦haha..PS: mom it didnât work..thatâs why I never spoke to anyone..they kept laughing at meâ¦and calling me âMiss Americaâ.  They all thought I was to âgoriâ for themâ¦anyways..i didnât care to speak to anyoneâ¦I had my Grandma and Grandpa..who understood English and I understood their Gujuâ¦so we got a cute little compromise goingâ¦well on my first day in dadâs village â¦ I decided to sit outdoors most of the day..inside it was too hot â¦ and outside there was a cool breeze.. it was odd in December the weather was decent in the mind 70âs and people were wearing blankets and sweaters ..like it was 40 degrees.. I guess they're not used to itâ¦I used to sit on a little porch with my dadaâ¦and watch people work..I thought it was entertainingâ¦the paan guy was always busyâ¦making paan and mavo..and ever so often heâs spit out red crap on the dirt road..he was amazing..he was able to spit like 10 feet away.. I was totally dumbfounded ..heâd win any spitting contest here in the statesâ¦but my most amazing and vivid memory in dadâs village was the old lady who collected cow dungâ¦she would walk around and collect all this crap and place it in a straw basket which she perfectly balanced on her headâ¦sheâd get mucho dinero if she worked for Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus..i knew she had skillsâ¦but check this out ..guess what she did with the cow dungâ¦she put water and straw on it and played with it ... like it was playdoughâ¦I could see the dung water slowly running down her arms and making small droplets near her elbow.  Sheâd wipe it off with her blue sariâ¦and continue on kneading her pile of sh*tâ¦like it was some sort of attaâ¦but what I luved the most was that sheâd take a piece and roll it into a ball then pat it out till it looked like a disk..afterwards sheâd balance this 8 inch disk in her left palm and swing her hand over her head ..and with all her might fling the disk into a wallâ¦in a few hours the whole wall would be covered with cow dung disksâ¦and sheâd clean up her mess and go into her concrete hutâ¦the next day I saw the old women peeling off the disk from the wall and placed them carefully in a basket like there were momâs special dinner china set only reserved for stuck up antiâsâ¦before long the old women was off again to collect more cow dung..I was baffled ..this women must luv playing with cow sh*tâ¦I wish I had some playdough for herâ¦however if u toss playdough into a wall it wonât stick..maybe she was tryin out for the Olympicsâ¦she was pretty good..anyways .. I watched her do this for about 4 days then I got curious ..i mean hello â¦ no one enjoys smelling like cow poo all dayâ¦I finally asked mom..and she told me they take the disk and burn it in a fire stove it tends to give off a great amount of energy and heatâ¦because wood is hard to find where my dad lives the locals burn cow dung and straw in their stovesâ¦well I was absolutely grossed out that I stopped eating anything that was made from the dung burning stoves and decided Iâd live on prepackaged food that u didnât have to warm up and fruitsâ¦.but I still wonder about that old women..and her making cow dung pattiesâ¦she must have really liked what she was doingâ¦she always had a smile on her face and hummed sweet bajans while she worked under the hot sunâ¦I wish her wellâ¦however I still refuse to eat roti off your stoveâ¦sorryâ¦   Question of the Day:  Do you think itâs possible for someone to learn to love their spouse after they had an arranged marriage?  I do not think this is possible, I believe one should fall in luvâ¦it donât think itâs right to force oneself to love someone..one should not compromise to attain loveâ¦It should just happen naturallyâ¦

      I know Iâm a few hours late posting todayâs blog ..and I just wanted to say sorry to all my fansâ¦lolâ¦It just that well yesterday at around 3:00 pmâ¦we lost full power (electricity) in 2 towers where I workâ¦We do have back up generators but I assume they are not powerful enough to run 2 buildings with 14 floors eachâ¦at about 3:45 we lost all phone lines too..I know I always wanted excitement at work but this was a bit too much..it was like pure chaosâ¦So I went homeâ¦and decided to run errandsâ¦then go to bedâ¦my co-worker texted messaged me at 5:00am to tell me they were still tryin to install a new generator and power will not return till noonâ¦so I turned off my alarm and turned up my ringer on my celliâ¦at around 9:30 Brian called stating he was heading home cuz there was no power..and he didnât think weâll get any before 2ish..and that I should call my director at 2â¦so I decided to watch 2 hours of  Dawsonâs Creek then a few episodes of Real Worldâ¦You would think I would use this time to my advantage to do some laundry, or clean my room, hell I didnât even make my bed..i had ultimately turned into a couch potatoâ¦I wasnât needed at work for a while so I was just gonna chill till ma celli rangâ¦after watchin 6 episodes of the real world the cell rang and I had to go to workâ¦itâs 4:02 and Iâm bored..Iâm here till 8..and I plan on being productive todayâ¦.lets seeâ¦.who can I bug on my IM buddy listâ¦ummâ¦anyways had a thought while watchin real world â¦ well currently we have 4 girls on that show â¦ 1) Robin: sheâs the cheerleaderâ¦with cute hair 2) Jamie: sheâs the oriental girl ..very pretty..3) Cameran: has long curly blonde hairâ¦miss goody 2shoesâ¦4) Frankie: miss punkâ¦she into hello kitty and dressing gothâ¦ok so now we have these 4 girlsâ¦ 3 of these 4 girls are totally into fashion ..or at least can dress wellâ¦then u have miss Frankieâ¦she basically dresses sloppy and doesnât care what she looks like â¦and all her clothes are blackâ¦however she does own one pink tank topâ¦ anyways a thought popped up in my head that out of all these girls only Frankie must wear matching undies..cuz everything she owns is blackâ¦I highly doubt the other girls wear matching undies even though they are perfectly matched externally..odd huhâ¦well itâs just a thoughtâ¦and maybe an opinionâ¦   Question of the Day:  Is it necessary for a girl to wear matching undies to be sexyâ¦?  I donât think so ..cuz if it is ..hell Iâll never be sexyâ¦I mean who really buys undies in pairsâ¦.?

      Recently Iâve been feeling a lot of pressureâ¦and Iâm not just talking about sinus pressure ..iâm talking about lifeâs pressureâ¦for example my parents are pressuring me to go to grad school, to get married, and to move outâ¦I also get pressured from my friends to go on holiday with them..when I donât have the time toâ¦it a bit too much..i have people constantly pressuring me into doin something when Iâm not ready to..i just wish people would leave me aloneâ¦..and let me make my own decisionsâ¦it getting to be a bit too much..and I think Iâm goin to blowâ¦life really sucks when u live inside a pressure cookerâ¦Iâm just waiting for the valve to burstâ¦.then life will fall into place..and Iâll be on my merry way..as for now â¦. I guess u just gotta dealâ¦.   Question of the Day   Whatâs more important having great sex in a marriage or having a great tunnel for communication?  I think communication is far out more important cuz hell when uâre 80â¦I donât know if the sex is goin to be that goodâ¦if your able to communicate freely..you can get a bit creativeâ¦and being 80 wouldnât even matterâ¦wink winkâ¦

      Iâve always been told how to live my life by the people around me, all these years Iâve listenedâ¦recently Iâve come to the realization that itâs my life and Iâm old enough to make my own decisionsâ¦I donât mind opinions or advice ..hell I welcome them ..but ordering me to do something thing ...is now out of the questionâ¦my parents didnât spend 80Gâs on my college tuition for others to make my decisions for meâ¦I think I have a mind of my ownâ¦sorry mom and dad this little baby is growing upâ¦yesterday was a rotten dayâ¦my feelings were beyond hurt and the sad part is .. I have no reason whyâ¦Iâd like to blame it on the non-existent quarter life crisisâ¦Iâm going through a clean up phaseâ¦I do it every so often ..it requires a lot of thinking and harsh actions on my partâ¦ but I think itâs healthyâ¦Itâs where I try to remove myself from all the negative people in my lifeâ¦ for example, you were introduced to someone by a friend and then u became friends with that person cuz hey it so easy to make friends these days..but let's now say your new friends only uses u .. as perhaps a time pass, because you have a car, or maybe cuz of your ability to do their homework, and the list can go on and on..all my life Iâd had these people randomly enter my life and in turn Iâd be blinded by their presence and motive ..these are the people that end up hurting your feelings in the end run â¦.over something extremely stupid.. they're beyond piety and cruel.. and I certainly donât need them in my life.. so I stop talking to them .. I know thatâs shady of me ..but seriously my parents didnât create me to have some 3rd world retard use me like the last sheet of toilet tissueâ¦Iâm better then thatâ¦anywaysâ¦went to see hum tum last nightâ¦it was a cute movie and the sub titles were decentâ¦I had a good timeâ¦however I was a bit disappointed with that saif boyâ¦he seemed to be having a bad hair day through out the movieâ¦oh well plus that rani chick did a great jobâ¦over all Iâd give it 3 out of 5 starsâ¦ went to the gym later ..i missed my training appointment so I rescheduled for Saturday ..ended up sitting and sweating my *ss off in the steam room.. I felt so clean and relaxed when I leftâ¦.for dinner  mom and dad had the nerve to order pizza not just any pizza but FAMOUS PIZZA..i mean they know Iâm tryin to stay away from that stuff like that ..anyways I bought home some veggie soft tocoâs it tasted like crapâ¦I went to bed pretty early last night... I was quite amazed .. and I actually slept well probably cuz I exhausted myself â¦Well as for today itâs 8:29am..and I misplaced  my swipe card again ..so the people at my sister company had to open the door for me .. I have to find that bloody sucker..i know I usually put it in my back pocket of my jeans â¦ lets c if it turns upâ¦ Iâm such a dodoâ¦ I feel a bit sick todayâ¦ my throat has been bothering me since I got upâ¦ it feels heavy and scratchy.. I already took one of those super strong cough drops and it not helpingâ¦I refuse to go to a doctorâ¦I hate those guy..they never have anything good to sayâ¦ oh wellâ¦ I have this weird feeling that my younger sister (age 13) skipped school todayâ¦I mean check this out..her bus leaves at 8:00 and she was still in her PJâs at 7:45 ..she hadnât even showered ..FYI: my sister takes 45 min showers..I managed to get out a scarastic "get dressed u gonna miss the bus" ... and she replied like back like a total blonde "like nah I totally showered at night, i'm so gonna change my clothes and jet on outta here...DUH!!STUPID!!" Is it me or was her damn bus goin to pick her up in 15 minâ¦ I donât know â¦that girl is way to weird for meâ¦ cuz I swear yesterday she told me talking a shower at night is so beyond totally grossâ¦great my lil sister has turned into a hypocrite â¦hopefully she went to school..and Iâm just over reactingâ¦ Had a very interesting convo with daddy dearest last nightâ¦he asked me if I was considering goin to Indian to find a hubby..i laughed and told him what do u think..i thought that would get me out of the discussion and I can leave his presence ..but it didnât work this time..he shot back âit not what I think it what u think that mattersâ..i knew this was goin to be a long *ss convo..i decided to make myself comfortable on the couchâ¦I told him that I donât think India would be a logical choice for me..iâm a weird type of ABCD..donât get me wrong Iâm American and was Borned in the states and Iâm hella Confused â¦and yah Iâm Desiâ¦but I have a fobby part to me tooâ¦I luv garba..and bhel puriâ¦and steaming hot somosas..i donât eat meatâ¦Iâm donât have a personal issue with god..i donât mind goin to the mandirâ¦however, I refuse to go to Sunday schoolâ¦Iâm a weird one I know..lets see.. I left the whole "find me a guy thing" up my parents and friends I refuse to dress skanky and go to clubs and bars hoping to get a permanent man in my life..with that approach one will only get a hangover, smelly cigarette hair and a one night standâ¦I think that whole approach is cheap and sleazy and I refuseâ¦ Iâd luv to meet someone in the mandir, or a library, park perhaps, Iâll can even do a coffee shopâ¦ I could be reading the devil wears prada..and he could be reading the latest john grishim novel.  Wow what an amazing scenarioâ¦not ever goin to happen but it was a nice thoughtâ¦all over a cup of low fat tazo chai latte hold the foam easy on the cream with a dash of cinnamon.  Yup niceâ¦ oh well .. got to get back to my teaâ¦talk to yah all tomorrowâ¦SMOOCHIESâ¦   Question Of The Day:  Which drink do you prefer? Sex on the Beach or Flaming Organism  Iâd prefer Sex on the Beachâ¦Flaming Organism is a bit too HOT!!! for meâ¦Naughty Naughtyâ¦lol

I wanted to go c a hindi movie today.. I donât know y I watch the bloody 3 hour epics lately.. it not like i know hindi.. it like watching pictures on the screens â¦ I donât know.. itâs probably me tryin to be an Indian.. mom says Iâm a coconut.. brown on the outside straight up white on the inside.. I think she might be right.. I want something to talk about to my desi friends, aunts, and parentsâ¦ so I watch desi movies.. donât get an ounce of it.. but I try to read the sub titles as fast as I can.. anyways.. I seriously have issues with certain desi movies.. they really need kissing scenes .. Â½ the time I think the lovers in the story are brother and sister ..dancing and singin in the rain..hell I think u can dance and sing in the rain with your brother.. I know I can.. plus my brother is 6â5 imagine the huge splashes he can create when he jumps in a puddle.. hehe.. yah but to all u directors out there please add some kissing scenes into your movies so I don't misinterpreted them â¦ nah Iâll tell u whatâs worse then the brother sister rain dance routine.. itâs what happens after.. the brother and sister hug ..and in the next scene the sister is holding a babyâ¦and guess what.. the bloddy brother is suppose to be the god damn fatherâ¦ I mean helloâ¦ if they had a kissing scene right before the rain dance ..iâd know immediately that they were lovers and not bro and sis .. and then the baby wouldnât gross me out.. yah I need to go to bollywood..and give Subhash Ghai, and company some friendly advice.. god damn.. but yah I want to c hum tum..i like that saif boy..looks like a fun filled movie..lets c if S anti is up to it..ok coffee is getting cold ..yes I know I broke my coffee ruleâ¦but u know what thereâs things out there that are worse then coffee..like President Bush..so leave me alone..and if not come over and kiss my mocha colored bootieâ¦MUHAAAAâ¦   Something To Think About:  Wouldnât u want to dance around in the rain with your lover..like Maduri and Salman..? I know I would â¦but guess what â¦do to my atrocious misfortune..Iâm only 2/3âs of the way there.. I got the backyard..and hell Iâve defiantly got the rainâ¦just need to find myself a god damn man..y..does it always come down to that â¦ ahh ..life officially sucksâ¦wonder if u could rent one for a few hours just for the danceâ¦umm something to think aboutâ¦yah..

      It was great having a 4 day weekendâ¦I was able to get out of jersey and attempt to relaxâ¦hereâs a run down of the events that happenedâ¦  Friday:   Rained ..Rained like bloody hell..it was insane.. I never minded the rain ..but today I was beyond irritated.. It was driving me nutzâ¦didnât have to go to work today ..dad thought it would be a bright idea to hit the hospital in the morning to get his x-rays doneâ¦We made it to the hospital at 8:30 ishâ¦ I decided to quickly brush my teeth and there was no need to immediately shower ..with the rain and all .. so I headed off â¦ dad was in painâ¦ he had this wrinkled look on his face.. where he attempted to look calm and kewl..but in turn he was screaming bloody murder inside.. anyways got to the hospital..where there was a waiting room full of peopleâ¦I could see dad getting irritated by the wait and once we were calledâ¦ dad all of the sudden turned into a horrid monster..which was not him..i mean it was oddâ¦a extremely pretty nurse called out momâs name cuz the insurance was under her name..but the prescription was under hisâ¦that what caused all the chaos..dad snapped at the pretty nurseâ¦ and she was baffled ..and continued her workâ¦it was odd..dad only yells when he is deeply hurtâ¦x-rays were performed â¦and we headed home..decided to ease the tension by playin this bhangra CD I haveâ¦ dad didnât comment on it ..so I decided in my head he luved it..or Iâd like to think he didâ¦anyways got home â¦ made lunch..and headed upstairs to do laundry..i decided to do 2 loads cold and hotâ¦separated clothes and tossed a load in the washer..headed upstairs to pack clothes for trip to PA..found out that I didnât have many clothes that I can pack â¦they were mostly in the large laundry pile in the center of my roomâ¦which in turn lead me to my bed and then I took a napâ¦woke up..ran downstairs to the basement to toss wet laundry into dryer to find brother's oversized getto *ss clothes stuffed in the dryerâ¦to top it off they were Â½ way dry.. decided that I would place his clothes in an empty laundry basket and pop my clothes in ..mom bought these amazing dryer sheets that smell like â¦ a great big rose garden.. tossed 2 inâ¦headed up stairs to find dad attempting to cook dinner in the kitchen by sitting on an office chair..it was a sad moment in the name of absolute boredomâ¦dad was cookin cuz ..yes he was boredâ¦he decided to make bangan barthaâ¦ewwâ¦I asked if he needed help he snapped back that he was not crippled just temporary out of order ..i managed to laugh a bit in my headâ¦I felt so awful..i let him go about cookin..and told him to give a shout if he needed meâ¦I trotted upstairs and ended up back in bedâ¦Arthur on PBS just finish as I woke up and saw the timeâ¦raced downstairs and grabbed the laundry out of the dryer..yes it was still hotâ¦quickly folded the clothes and hung the ones that need to be hungâ¦I like folding my clothes right out of the dryer ..i avoid the iron routine..which I despise..yuck yuckâ¦pop the second load in and happily pranced upstairs to find dad layin on the living room floor with a gigantic blueprint in front of himâ¦had this sudden urge of walkin all over his blueprints just cuz I luv the rustling sound under my toes..but I knew dad would have me murdered ..if I ruined his workâ¦lol..walked by with a sheepish smirk on my face into the kitchen and grabbed a water bottle..i seriously need to start drinkin a lot of water ..iâve gotten really bad..dad said we should go and get the x-rays from the hospital so back to the rotten hospital we goâ¦I hate goin there..it smells like deathâ¦.or I think it doesâ¦still rainin ..eww..came back home placed last load in dryer ..and started packin clothes â¦my brother and I decided to visit my aunt (bâmasi) in PA..i was excited .. I was finally getting out of the house..yippieâ¦called bâmasi and asked her if she wanted any groceries she stated all she needed was squashâ¦and to pick up dinner she the kind of person that u would go into utter shock if u saw cookin..iâve havenât really seen bâmasi cook a meal since she got married to Aâkakaâ¦and had baby M and baby Vâ¦ I really didnât care ..i luved Aâkaka warm breakfasts and barbecues...it was summer and Iâm goin to enjoy itâ¦masi said to pick up famous pizza and I thought it would be a good idea tooâ¦not knowing how much traffic weâd hitâ¦brother came home from school to toss his Â½ wet clothes back into dryer and attempted to have a small snack..i was starving ..but didnât know what to eat..i did the usual walked into the kitchen announced to dad I was hungry dad grumbled âeat somethingâ I grabbed 1 grape from the fruit basket and called it lunch...yes I know Iâm totally insane ..now leave me aloneâ¦left home and hit a bit of traffic near the shore points then nailed 90 all the way on PA turnpike..it was great..managed to keep bro entertained by speakin in my atrocious Guju to him..i literally thought he was goin to pass out from laughin so hard..thatâs when it hit me ..i had to go pee..like no other..i couldnât concentrated on driving I had to go soo bad..and there wasnât a rest area in sight ..i hate takin a random exit..cuz I never know what itâs goin to lead to ..but I had to soo badâ¦ I took the exit and drove for a Â½ hour to find a burger king..went pee..and felt like a million bucks..yippie..got back on the turnpike and nailed it to masiâs place before it got darkâ¦we all hovered the pizza and grabbed the kids and went to bedâ¦    Saturday:   Woke up by M standing over my bed â¦ poking her little fingers into my eye sockets ..canât believe she got so tallâ¦in a few short months..kids these days grow up so fast..bâmasi said V was not feeling well and she had to take him to the doctorâs..so she took bro with her and I went to take a showerâ¦Aâkaka was headin off to the gym when I walked downstairsâ¦I saw that masi left a cup of coffee for me which I nooked in the micro..and had a small cinna bun..for breakfast..and guess what they had a desi program on for me..odd huh just as I was through putting dirty dishes in the dish washer a hindi movie started it was called Ganga ki saugandâ¦or some thing like that ..it had rakha and I like her..so I sat down and chilled ..bâmasi walked in with M and V..V looked horribleâ¦and cranky..he wouldn't go by anyone..so I decided to chill with Mâ¦Aâkaka came back and took bro to their neighbors BBQ..and bâmais and I decided weâll go later â¦ we put the kids to sleep and Aâkaka came back and bâmasi and I left ..the BBQ was fun but I got soo bored â¦ I was surrounded by little toddlers or extremely pregnant women who were talking about swollen legs and nursing..i decided I was not interested in either topic and I grabbed a toddler and headed outsideâ¦ it was fun these 2 adorable girls about 4 yrs old were dressed up as princesses ..soo cute..masi called me in for food..and I had a veggie burger and some pasta salad..we ended up sitting in the sun talking about interior decorating ..which was another topic I had no interest in and I tended to focus more on the horseshoe game the men were playing..we finally left he neighborsâ¦yippieâ¦we got home and masi had to feed the kids..she made kitchadi..eww..felt so bad..masi was pissed..M was not eating right cuz we were all around â¦ she kicked AâKaka and bro out so they hit a movie and I was sent upstairs and not allowed to come down till I was calledâ¦that sucked ..i decided that their dinner would take about an hour so I decided to call D a friend that was visiting from UK â¦ she was busy..so I took a nap..to be rudely awakened by bâmasi screams ..she was so loudâ¦and M was cryinâ¦I decided to stay in the room and not go downstairsâ¦soon after masi called me down and the kids were fedâ¦there was a smile of pure satisfaction on masiâs face and empty bowls in her handsâ¦it was great ..now all she had to worry about was them not throwing upâ¦Aâkaka and bro came back and bought home tocoâs for dinner..once again masi got out of cookinâ¦went to bed after dinnerâ¦.  Sunday:  Woke up at 10:30 was shocked the house was extremely quietâ¦walked downstairs to see masi with V in the kitchen cleaning ..odd..she said V threw up in his sleep and gotten the bed dirty..i donât know how she does it .. I put her in the super women category ...amazingâ¦Iâd loose my kewl if I was herâ¦she said Aâkaka was goin to BBQ today I was so excited ..and kaka would also make breakfastâ¦bro came downstairs and kaka decided to make veggie soy bacon and sausage .. for me and masi cuz we donât eat meatâ¦and French toast for my brotherâ¦meanwhile I played with V and M in the toy room..had breakfast ... it was amazingâ¦Bâmasi said she need to get a few thing for the BBQ and now that Mâmasi was joining us we need more burgersâ¦and she also was in desperate need of a pedicure ..god bâmasi is so high maintenance ..lolâ¦we hit a few clothin stores .. and masi bought a few capris and shirtsâ¦It odd everything masi puts on looks great on her.. she looks a bit like sri devi from the old hindi movies ..absolutely gorgeous .. so when she plaster a smile on her face I could almost imagine her on the bollywood big screen..iâm glad I have her as an aunt..she really something..we headed off to the super market where we picked up stuff..and headed off to the nail salon to find out that it was closed â¦we went home and masi took V up for a nap and I cut up all the veggies and Aâkaka fired up the grill.. I was starving..Mâmasi came with Vâkaka and Big A and Little Aâ¦ it was fun having dinner with the family in the yard..listenin to lawnmowers and kids playin in the distance.. Food was great once again Aâkaka out did himself..we quickly cleaned up to find ourselves snuggled up in the living room watchin National Security it was beyond hilarious .. Mâmasi and family left and Bâamsi and AâKaka took kids to bed ..i was now wide awake and bro and I decided that another movie was a good idea â¦ we ended up watchin Hollywood Homicide .i thinkâ¦ donât remember the name but it was with josh hartneck..umm yummyâ¦went to bed..  Monday:   Woke up brushed teeth headed downstairs in totally shock ..nearly diedâ¦saw god and a light at the end of the tunnelâ¦I could not believe it ..a women that looked like bâmasi was in front of the stove stirring some delicious smelling content..i was amazed ..Bro was sitting at the kitchen table patiently awaiting what bâmasi had stirred up..she told us not to eat much cuz it was an appetizer ..i never had an appetizer for breakfast but hey she was cookin and I wasnât about to complain ..then she took out the big guns and made dosaâ¦I was utterly amazed â¦dosa was sooo yummy..i was in heaven..this was a vacationâ¦masi made me some wraps for the week and bro some Mexican bean dip..Masi told me to go to the super market to pick up milk, marshmallows, lettuce and onionsâ¦I managed to find all these items and I was headed out when I found a bar of Toblerone candyâ¦masi had told me her fantasy was to sit in her room with a big bar of Toblerone candy without the kids and devour the over sized candy bar all by herself..so I bought it for herâ¦I thought hey I can provide her the candy and Aâkaka can watch the kids for an hour..and she can live out her fantasyâ¦got back to masiâs and packed up car with luggage and food.. and we were on our way..we knew we were goin to hit traffic so I was mentally prepared for the cursing and the swearing that would come out of my mouth during our drive backâ¦we were off â¦we got on the PA turnpike and nailed 80 all the way to the Delaware bridge..I was glad my friend P kept calling or else I would have lost my sanity with the traffic and my botherâs annoyin âAre we Home Yetâevery 5 min. â¦ we hit the NJ turnpike and it was over Satin was punishing me â¦I never saw traffic so damn think..why the hell does every one want to live in jerseyâ¦ I mean I live there cuz I have to ..but it was insane ..i tried to keep my kewl..with all the stupid people drivin like the roads were owned by their dad's .. I mean have u ever heard of a turn signal..it was nutzâ¦sort of like a war zone..like Kurukshetra from the Mahabharata..just replace the chariots with Toyotas Cameryâs and Honda Civicâs..it was insaneâ¦got home to find we had company over..went to get dad prescription from Rite Aid..to find it was closed ..no biggie went home had dinnerâ¦and hit the sackâ¦yes yes I know aloneâ¦I need a manâ¦

      Ok ..as most of you know my only form of entertainment is my ride up 11 flights on the elevator to my officeâ¦well long behold the door opened on the lobby floor graciously around 7:55amâ¦just for me to walk in with a cup of coffee in my left hand and my swipe card in my right.. this was a daily ritual for me ..due to the fact that I would never dare to use the stairs .. to me it was beyond suicidal ..only use stairs if elevator is brokenâ¦or if a fire occurs.. but thatâs only climbing down if elevator is broken... and if I need to get to the 11th floor .. trust me Iâll call my director from the lobby and state that Iâm sick and I canât come to work todayâ¦ I refuse to walk up those stairs.. ok now that weâve totally drifted from my story lets get backâ¦   .. the doors open ..and wowâ¦ the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu is waiting for meâ¦ he must have got on in the basement garage floor.. this guy was amazingâ¦ beyond any young adult female fantasyâ¦ god must have spend weeks making a man soo freaking perfectâ¦ I shamelessly found myself weaseling behind him in a perfectly empty elevatorâ¦ I desperately needed a glace at his little tight kundi.. god it like seeing Mickey Mouse at Disney.. u just have tooâ¦canât help it.. while I drooled over his tight buns he softly whispered âwhat floorâ in a delicate British accent.. all that was going though my head was â Kris .. keep mouth closed and attempt to breath in then outâ¦.â.. I managed to softly say â11â and he flexed out his tender hard muscles to the elevator button labeled â11â thatâs when I got a whiff of his freshly wash head and shoulder shampooed hairâ¦ I was in heaven.. nothing could spoil todayâ¦ then due to my horrid luck once again in a super possessed elevator designed by Satan himself.. oh my god it was gross.. he lifted his right hand from his right suit pant pocket and reached behind himself and tuggedâ¦. U got it.. he bloody just picked a freaking wedgie right in front of me in a freaking elevator.. the man had no shame.. my brain went dead ..and the tacky hindi music stopped playing and me and him stopped dancing in the rainâ¦ reality hit and my daydream was brutally interrupted by is delicate fingers picking at his tighty whitiesâ¦ i was beyond disgusted.. the elevator now stopped and I had a huge frown on my face.. I walked out of the liftâ¦without looking backâ¦ and remembered Newtonâs 3rd law to every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.. to every thing good there is something as equally badâ¦ I just proved this law in an elevator no bigger then 5ft by 5ftâ¦ gorgeous guy picks wedgie.. what a turn off.. looks like Iâm going to have to put ice on it today.. pooâ¦   Definition of WEDGIE: (The condition of having one's clothing stuck between the buttocks)    Question of the Dayâ¦.   Whatâs the most gruesome act youâve seen committed in an elevatorâ¦?

       Well here goes ..for all those to care and for all those who donâtâ¦.recently Iâve noticed I tend to pick up my cell at night if someone calls and talk to them in my sleepâ¦when I wake up in the morning I have no recollection of the conversation...I have no idea what I say ..or whom I say it to ..to tell you the truth I donât even remember the phone ringingâ¦itâs very odd ..cuz the very next day I tend to throw a tantrum at my friends for not calling me back and they shockingly state that they called and we spoke on the phone ..i think my unusual nocturnal sleeping habits are effecting my memory skills.. Iâve had many friends swear on the âWicked Witch of the Westâs Graveâ that they did speak to me around 2:00am ESTâ¦however I canât seem to remember them calling or what we talked aboutâ¦usually they say that I told them Iâll call them back tomorrowâ¦or Iâll answer their questionsâ¦then hang upâ¦this is a freighting issue cuz what if someone calls starts asking me about my deepest darkest secrete'sâ¦which I donât think I have but maybe I do sub-consciously and I suppress them cuz their so horridâ¦I mean the human psyche is a complicated thingâ¦ I never talk in my sleep unless someone talks to me and starts asking me stuff.. I never voluntarily talk ..i need to voice record what I sayâ¦what if it not me talking what if it a spirit that takes over my body in the eveningâ¦so the person talking to you on the phone is not me but some dead person that was murdered by their concubine. and now heâs out for revenge and heâs using my body at night ..ahhhâ¦way to creepyâ¦anyways ..for all u guys out there that Iâve accused for not calling and Iâm greatly sorryâ¦but hey u have to admit I do sound cute when Iâm Â½ asleepâ¦.    Question of the Dayâ¦.   Do you do unusual things in your sleep (ex: walk, talk, eat, or clean)..?

      Some of you might be aware of the email war that is going on in your mailboxesâ¦Iâd like to apologize for starting this whole messâ¦I simple wrote an email asking where all my fans were due to the fact that I hadn't received any comments one particular morning â¦and no one appeared on AOL IMâ¦ a simple email caused a huge controversyâ¦some of you were intelligent enough to ignore it and delete it from your mailboxes ..other thought they had to take a standâ¦ my whole motive with blogging was to express my way of thinking to all my friends who I honestly thought gave a damn about me. I thought it would be a good way to keep in touch cuz some of u are in UK, TX, FL, CA, WI, CT, and NJâ¦plus I get an artificial high when Iâd get a comment or the counter on my page would increase by one ..knowin that someone out there just got a glimpse of my worldâ¦itâs probably the only time where Iâm totally enlightened â¦and utterly happyâ¦ I never knew my joy for writing stupid stuff would create such a problemâ¦I just wanted to write and have funâ¦sorryâ¦.  -kRiS   Question of the Dayâ¦  Now Whatâ¦?

      Got into work at 8 ish today.. once again didnât sleep well.. my hand was killing me.. I sort of pulled a muscle in my right palmâ¦anyways got dressed and drove to work ..made a quick stop to get coffee and a muffinâ¦ turned on computerâ¦and checked voicemails ..while I was checking emails ..my director walked by and simple said â HI KRIS!â in turn I squealed âOH NOâ¦TONY â¦ BUGââ¦ âWANT A TISSUEâ.. tony attempted to entrap this enormous size cockroach off my desk however missed and it quickly dashed behind my desk.. I donât know if u ever had something as enormous as a tyrannosaurus rex on your desk but I just did ..i mean it had like 5 creepy legs ..one must have broke off or he must have been a mutated bug with an extra legâ¦ due to all the rat poison its mom must have ingested while she was pregnant. So currently I type in fear that this bug might jump up from behind ma desk and bloody devour my left hand pinky finger which lays freakishly on the letter âAâ on ma keyboardâ¦I however find it a bit unusual that a huge squeaky clean biosphere-like cooperate building where the men dress like they just stepped off of the set of âMen In Blackâ which houses thousands of cooperate zombies that work on the say of Alan Greenspanâs economic advices would allow a freaking tyrannosaurus rex like cockroach running around like a little ant in their safe havenâ¦I should have wore my boots it probably gonna crawl up my freshly ironed GAP kakiâs with satin lined pocketsâ¦ and viciously nibble on the natural wrinkles of my tender kneeâ¦with its razor sharp incisor teeth.. ahhhâ¦gotta stop writing Iâm bloody freaking outâ¦ITâS GONNA EAT MEâ¦.    Question of the Dayâ¦   What kind of bug are u most afraid ofâ¦?

      Well yesterday we were invited to S Antiâs house for dinnerâ¦due to the fact that mom and lil sister went to Florida â¦ and with my inability to cook S Anti decided to be a total sweetie and take over the roles of cooking to spare me the aggravation of presenting a charcoal flavored cuisineâ¦ To my great surprise anti made soft tacos with homemade salsaâ¦ she actually sat down and cut 4 pounds of tomatoesâ¦ after all u know gujuâs eat salsa like itâs bloody okra curryâ¦and tend use an oversize ladle to scoop Â½ pound potions into 1 tacoâ¦ well Iâm personally not a salsa person ..due to the fact that on the spicy fact-o-meter on an average from 1 to 10 ..10 being extremely spicy I fall at the number (â 10).. I do not have tolerance for spicy food ..so I took an embryo size droplet and place it on the edge of ma taco ..and proceeded to take a hefty size biteâ¦ suddenly I became enchanted by this luscious texture of finely chopped tomatoes, onions, and corianderâ¦ I was baffled that I was actually enjoying this heartburn causing poison in an orgasmic way ..before long I ladled out a huge scoop of this new venom and smeared it all over the bed of lettuce and devoured it like a deprived Somalian hyenaâ¦ before long I was reaching for seconds ..I knew that the salsa was tainted but with what?.. my tongue tingled at the spiciness but kept asking for more ..and my lips burned with eternal fire ..I knew I was hooked.. like a fetus to itâs umbilical cord â¦what caused this madness?â¦ why was I not able to have any self-control? â¦ why was I not able to think for myself?.. something had taken over me.. I was addicted.. but to what ..salsa.. no I think S anti must have tainted the salsa with cocaine.. she had to â¦ like the old coca cola soda pop.. they used to put cocaine in it to have their consumers addicted to their useless idea of soda with no nutritional value.. was S anti trying to get us addicted to her salsa.. by tainting it with an illegal substance â¦would she dare ?â¦   Question of the Dayâ¦?  What do you find yourself addicted to?

      Ok Iâve noticed all desi women have huge hips and thunder thighs compared to all the other racesâ¦I know itâs good to have wide hips ..helps the birthing processâ¦but hell I mean â¦ it not like we goin to give birth to a f*cking hippopotamusâ¦Iâve noticed cuz of our deformed bodies the latest fashion of clothes donât seem to fit well example: low rise jeans ..yah they look fine when your standing up ..but have u ever sat down while wearing a pair of low rise jeans ..hello they reveal a bit more than the tip of your butt crack... I mean who comes up with these types of clothes ..probably the same guys who invented Playboy â¦and have u ever tried buying a bikini.. I mean no matter what style u get your thighs will never look proportional to your ankles.. so in turn your butt looks flat and your boobs look smallâ¦so u decided on a stupid one piece which will ruin your tan but will cover your oprah sized tooshieâ¦ but the bad thing is if you have the slightest bit of flab around your midriff ..itâs over.. that one piece will magnify itself 100 times to the bloody 10th powerâ¦ one tiny roll of fat will look like your pregnant with septupletsâ¦ thatâs why smart desi women should wear boxer bikiniâs with a halter topsâ¦ this style allows u to cover those thunder thighs and enhance those size Aâsâ¦and might I also add it makes that tiny roll of flesh in your tummy area virtually disappearâ¦. So all your desi chicks out there strut your stuff and have fun in the sunâ¦I know I willâ¦    Question of the Day:    What do you think looks awful on desi chicksâ¦?

      I get a kick out of guys who wear dhotiâs..not only do they have ballsâ¦but I also think they look soo yummyâ¦Iâve come up with a few categories of different styles of dhoti wearersâ¦   1) Pandit Dhotiâs â The men who wear these dhotiâs are the pujaries that work at a temple and serve god. There dhotiâs compromise of a long thin white cloth that wraps around their waist. Whatâs unique about this type of dhoti is that itâs practically sheer and see-through ..so while your pandit is doing arti you get a full blown view of his tighty whitiesâ¦ the reason they wear see-though dhotiâs is because they are celibate and no one can have them â¦so to rub it in your face they decided that they can be a teaseâ¦shame on u..  2) Guju Garba Dhotiâs â Most of the men who wear these types of dhotiâs are young adults during the week of Navaratri. These dhotiâs come in various bright colors with exotic embroideries. What I luv the most about this style is when a young man jumps up to hit their partners dandia during raasâ¦their dhoti fills up with airâ¦ resembling a balloonâ¦and you get a tasteful glace at their gorgeous legsâ¦  3) South Indian Fishing Dhotiâs â The men who usually were this style are fisherman by profession and wear their dhotiâs very high to prevent them from getting wetâ¦almost resembling one of Paris Hiltonâs micro-mini skirtsâ¦What amuses me the most about this style is the guts a man must have to wear his dhoti so short that when he bends over one can see his little chaddiâ¦oh and might I add this type of dhoti fully exposes legsâ¦yippieâ¦  4) Bengali Devdas Dhotiâs â Now this dhoti is very complicated and longâ¦so if your stingy with fabric this type of dhoti is not for youâ¦This style tends to occupy your waist by holding up your dhoti..and your arm by holding the tail. So at all times a man has to drape his dhoti tail over his arm so that he will not trip over itâ¦now here is a scenario.. a bengali devdas dhoti wearer wants to wash his hands in a public bathroomâ¦does he hand over his dothi tail to his fellow neighbor to hold on to while he scrubs his hands cleanâ¦I wonder what happens to the dothi tailâ¦ummmâ¦  5) I Ran Out of Fabric Dhotiâsâ Now these dhoti wearers are usually poor farmers that donât have much money to spend on an extra foot of fabricâ¦Whatâs unique about this style is that they are not fully exposed like the South Indian Fishing dhoti wearers ..these men only show their ankles ..so they leave much to the imagination.. those poor farm girlsâ¦now you know why farmers in India have so many kids ..once a farm chick sees those legs she just canât get enoughâ¦naughty naughtyâ¦   If any of you guys come up with additional categories please feel free to comment below and let me in on your insightâ¦   also..check out spiderman in a dhoti:   "CORRECTION"   : as per Mr. C-man...he stated that the spiderman in a dhoti link which was available here prior to 07/26/04.. impared his informative personal copyright law..so to all my viewer i'm sorry...

      Had a plain bagel with low fat vegetable cream cheese for breakfast today ..with a large cup of black hazelnut coffee ..duhâ¦ I started breakfast at 8:00am and most of you guys now it takes me forever to eat ..so I just finished the stupid bagel at 12:24pm..and itâs now 12:57pm and Iâm beyond agitated and irritatedâ¦I got a tiny piece of bagel wedged behind my back molarsâ¦it driving me nutz.. you would think I would do a tongue sweep, however ma bloody tongue is just not doing the trick.. I refuse to stick my finger in my mouth and yank it out.. thatâs kinda gross and knowing me Iâll make gagging sounds that resemble the mating call of a duckbill platypusâ¦ Iâm totally frustrated not only at the annoying piece of bagel but also at the fact that ma office is below freaking 50 degreesâ¦ itâs so cold in here that Iâve lost my sense of control and my brain is not communicating with my bladder properly.. I constantly feel like I have to pee.. and I get a tingly sensation every so often in my index finer and pinky of ma right handâ¦ and I think my eye lids are shiveringâ¦ahhh I need helpâ¦does anyone have remedies for my dilemmas??? If you have some insight please leave a commentâ¦

      Ok check this out ..while driving to work today I saw the most obscene sceneâ¦ there was a desi guy wearing a suit standing on a corner waiting to cross the road and make his way to the chutney scented train station.. from the looks of things I came to the conclusion that he must have an upper level position in an IT firm.. perhaps as a senior manager, lead programmer or even a VP of their IT Department.. he stood vibrantly with a leather laptop bag.. and was dressed very well for a man in his mid- 30âsâ¦the light turned red and I had to stopâ¦and I had a great view of this desi bill gates wanna beâ¦ I was going to smile at my fellow desi-dude until he did itâ¦ u got itâ¦ he bloody pinched his nose and blew out snot right on the corner of Wood Aveâ¦ I nearly died.. It was utterly pukingly gross.. then he proceeded to open up his $150 suit jacket and pull out a nicely starched handkerchief.. and arrogantly wiped his snotty hands in a rhythmic fashionâ¦ I glared at the sidewalk with my mouth dropped open ..there was off-white colored human mucus splatter all over the curb.. I wanted to hurl in ma car.. I was so embarrassed â¦knowing for sure the cars next to me saw the desi-dude blow his honker in the most vulgar fashionâ¦this obscene gesture makes all other brown skinned 3rd world people like me look extremely horrificâ¦ right now Iâm ashamed at the uneducated ways of a H1-visa holders ability to suction out snot form their noseâ¦the US government should not give him a green card with out proper demonstration with power point slides on proper techniques of removing mucus from ones nose in a tasteful fashionâ¦.that man was a snot headâ¦ shame on youâ¦     Question of the Dayâ¦   What was the grossest behavior youâve ever seen?

      Well itâs only been 36 mins. since I came to work and weirdest things are already happing to meâ¦ I was able to find an excellent parking spot in our oversized parking garageâ¦then proceeded to dash down the lobby and jostle my way in the elevator before the doors severed my left arm â¦ by the time I nestled myself in the back left corner of the claustrophobic cube slowly awaiting my 11th floor stop I managed to look up to see 3 old men wearing uniformsâ¦to my great surprise and horrid luck ..it just happened to be a 1) Fed-ex guy 2) UPS guy 3) US Postal Service guyâ¦my heart just stopped and I forgot how to breathâ¦ I couldnât believe my luck â¦they gave each other evil stares as if they all mysteriously slept with each others wivesâ¦ I noticed they were all flashing their gadgety things that they use to scan packagesâ¦seeing whoâs was bigger and longer ..as if they were going to compare their penis sizeâ¦ the elevator slowly made itâs way up to the 8th floor where the UPS guy walked out like a hung over cowboy withtwo .45 caliber pistols straped on to his one size fit all jock strapâ¦the other 2 men in the elevator showed their Efferdent soaked denturesâ¦I decided that I needed a swig of fresh air ..or else I was going to pass outâ¦ I managed to take a small breath ..when suddenly the cables that held the oversized cubed box that was carrying us stopped violently on the 10th floorâ¦ I could hear my heart beat so thunderously under my 100% cotton blouse purchased for $17.99 at the GAPâ¦. I knew I was about to see a fist fight between 2 wrinkled men in an elevator that was no bigger then 5feet by 5 feetâ¦ I was in no mood for a battle between the best parcel servicesâ¦ I knew I had to make it up to the 11th floorâ¦ then I was in safe havenâ¦the doors slowly opened on the 10th floor and the Fed-Ex guy lifted up his size 36 waist cotton/nylon blend navy blue trouser shortsâ¦ to prove to the US Postal Service guy that he wore the pants in that elevator during the rideâ¦ I nearly pissed all over myself when the US Postal serviced guy pulled out a pen from his rear left side pocket.. I knew that was going to be the murder weapon used to kill the Fed-Ex guy ..i prayed the elevator door would closeâ¦ soon enough my prayers were answered by no other then âHare Krishnaââ¦so now it was just me and the US Postal Service guy ..he smirked at me ..as if he was a vampire waiting upon his last meal before the sun rose.. I wanted to blurt out âyou know my mom works for you guys too, luv your uniformsâ ..and jet out of the door when they openedâ¦I tried to keep focus on the dial on the top of the elevator doors.. impatiently waiting for the number 11 to appearâ¦soon enough they did and I shot out like a bullet from a semiautomatic AK 47â¦ and made my way through the doorsâ¦when a hand grabbed my shoulder ..i nearly screamed with frightâ¦ I turned around to see the bright blue eyes of the US Postal service guyâ¦he was raising his hand ..i knew he was going to stab me in the eye with his .25 cent Parker penâ¦ soon enough his hand came into focus and he was holding â¦yah u got it ..my god damn âSWIPE CARDââ¦I dropped it on the floor when I was placing my keys in my backpackâ¦.. I know Iâm such a DUMB*SSâ¦   Hereâs a recipe of how to make a kRiS Cocktail that I got from  urlLink http://www.go-quiz.com/cocktail/cocktail.php :    How to make a kRiS:   Ingredients:  5 parts mercy  5 parts silliness  5 parts energy  Method:  Add to a cocktail shaker and mix vigorously.

      Ok yesterday was a damn scary day..iâve told u about G Antiâs dog..and how big it isâ¦well yesterday I was outside enjoying the fresh cool breeze sitting on the porch talking to Dr. Pâ¦ when all of the sudden Sweetie (dog) comes running towards me.. I know she was happy to see me..and she really wanted to play..but hello âu gigantic freak of nature can u not see Iâm deathly afraid of uââ¦ well while her 150 pounds of raw meat came running towards me at super sonic speed .. my life just FROOZE.. you got it ..it bloody froze.. I mean I thought Iâd see my whole childhood flash before my eyes.. I mean thereâs not much of a childhood cuz Iâm only 23.. but still nothing flashed ..now the dog was on me and uâd think Iâd scream âget off meâ but the only word that came out of my mouth was âDONâTâ I mean donât whatâ¦donât pee on me, donât eat me, donât lick meâ¦I have no bloody idea what I was thinking of at that pointâ¦I mean who say âDONâTâ when a dog is attacking youâ¦ G Anti started laughing when sweetie started licking my hand I wanted to vomitâ¦I was so scaredâ¦ I used to luv this dog when she was a lil pupâ¦I remember carrying her around the block like a little baby ..but now man .. this dog can carry me aroundâ¦ itâs so damn huge.. but guess what I didnât even sweat a tear.. however G Anti said the look on my face was beyond a Kodak moment.. oh well .. I guess Iâm afraid of big dogsâ¦I just need to be more aware and work on my, âOH MY GOD YOUR DOGâS GONNA EAT ME VOCABULARYââ¦.   Question of the Day:  What are u deathly afraid ofâ¦?  Well thereâs 2 thingsâ¦ 1) Sweetie 2) my momâs vaalan (rolling pin)â¦j/k..lol

      Woke up this morning to hear intense growling ..at first I thought it was my tummy..i havenât been eating right for the past few dayâ¦however when I got out of bed I still noticed the growling soundâ¦ I proceeded to leave the room.. to find G Antiâs German Shepard/Alaskan huskie growling in her cageâ¦ all I could do at this point was laugh in my head.. Iâm such a dumb*ssâ¦ well the poor dog needed to go pee desperately ..and I refused to open her cage.. I mean this dog is huge.. I usually donât fear dogs.. but this one is a monsterâ¦ before long G Antiâs kid came down and let the dog out.. I got ready and decided to go to work.. I was half way there when I noticed I didnât have my seat belt on.. Iâm usually anal when it comes to that stuffâ¦ I will not drive until everyone has their seat belts on and today â¦well I forgot to wear mine.. I have no idea where my head is todayâ¦ I hope godâs watching over meâ¦cuz today Iâm a lost causeâ¦

      Ok .. today while driving to work..i hit a red traffic light..so while I sat in my car applying a thin layer of strawberry flavored chap stick to my already cherry flavored lips.. I saw 2 not 1 but 2 Budweiser trucksâ¦ they were huge.. I mean I live in a pretty small town where buses, taxis, and trucks are not very commonâ¦ so now Iâm thinking where could these 2 trucks made their dump.. then it hit me ..hello my office building it's right accross the street.. itâs huge.. thousands and thousands of people work thereâ¦ and we have a huge cafÃ© with a wall of reach in freezers ready to dispense soda, bottled water, and thirst quenchersâ¦I wonder if they started carrying beerâ¦how awesome would that beâ¦ Iâd be in heavenâ¦ well soon enough the light turned green and reality hit.. âI DONâT DRINK DOMESTIC BEERâ (sorry Budweiser) â¦   Question of the Day:  What your favorite type of beer?   I prefer an ice cold Heineken or a Corona with a lemon..(thatâs lemonâ¦not lime..i want the yellow stuff)â¦. and if Iâm in a real feisty mood I can even do Killians.

      Life in High School was great.. had an amazing group of friends â¦ who we used to laugh with cry with and most definitely borrow cloths withâ¦each person had their role in our groupâ¦ they made a contribution.. I never figured out my role or how I fit in.. but I was a part of it..and for that Iâm utter and most grateful.. here are a list of my friends sand their qualitiesâ¦  Sadhi â Amazing girl who I always fought with for reasons I canât even remember.. I remember once I called her father a chiea pet and she didnât talk to me for 2 weeks we had an amazing love hate relationship.. when we were together we used to fight and when we were apart we would long for each otherâ¦ it was odd..sadhi got all the men.. she looked great in whatever she put on..had a body of a short greek goddessâ¦ the girl was able to stop trafficâ¦ she was a little ghetto in her ways ..but I luved goin over to her place where she would cook for meâ¦ the person who I never thought Iâd look up to.. now is my mentor in lifeâ¦  Radha â My dad said we were made for each other .. just like our namesâ¦ we fit well.. she was like the mommy and I was the baby.. I remembered whenever a little fight would break out among us usually sadhi and me.. weâd go to radha for advice.. for some odd reason I canât seem to remember what she told us..but whatever it was .. helpedâ¦ radha was like a ring master to me.. she made sure everyone was happyâ¦he was wild and adventurousâ¦ she was the one who told me sneaking out and goin to parties was OK.  She the one who taught me how to lie to my parents.. she taught me well her teachings came into great use in college ..for that radha I will always be gratefulâ¦  Ripal â this girl was so cute.. she came in a tiny package but she could be heard for milesâ¦she never stopped talkingâ¦ and never procrastinated.. this chicka would have her school clothes planned out on the weekend..so all she had to do was put them on in the morning.. I thought that was odd. She would mix and match shirts with pants and earrings.. she was the fist girl that got me acquainted with manicures, and eye makeup.. sorry rips I stopped using eye makeupâ¦ to hard of a task to applyâ¦I remember the birthday parties and Christmas parties we used to have at her house in her basement â¦ sadly I donât even remember what we did.. I remember eating and talking up a storm.. to this girl I own my shy days too.. for now one can not get me to stop talkingâ¦  Krishna Shah â other than having the same name as her.. we called this little one âSHAHâ..this girl was quite brilliant ..very competitive.. never against me though I was the airhead in my group..i think they all called me âCluelessâ at one point in timeâ¦ it was neck and neck with this girl and radha..donât know yâ¦perhaps they were both extremely brilliantâ¦miss shah..had the most interesting crushâsâ¦she would swoon over guys while Iâd be thinking about Barbie dollsâ¦ always very mature and never really acted her ageâ¦she wanted to be an adult when she ws marly a kidâ¦ I learned a lot form this girlâ¦ if u study and give it your best shot uâll do well.. look shah .. I did well in college and have a great job.. look Iâm not a slackerâ¦I finally succeededâ¦  Vivek â this manâ¦amazing he suppose to be the âPLAYERâ.. âMR. HOTTIEâ.. I canât think of any desi girl who did not want to go out with him at one point in time..other than me.. remember I was never into guys till I hit puberty sophomore year of college..i know Iâm a late bloomerâ¦  Mr. Stud..here got all the girls â¦ Iâve never seen him without one.. I once bumped into him at a club my 2nd yr of college and girls were hanging off of him like monkeys off a banana tree..heâs very sweet and charming has charisma, style, and a killer smile.. basically heâs the guy a girl would want to bring home.. NOT!!!..but over all very sweet kid that all of the above girls wanted at one pointâ¦   lucky man..no one wanted me.. pooo  See I had amazing friends growing upâ¦ hopefully Iâll get to see them all very soonâ¦that was the last time I saw vivek since graduation and sadhi one a year ago at her wedding.. but the reast I really never sawâ¦ all I know is that Iâm very gratefulâ¦thank u all for being my friend..and Iâll never forget uâ¦muhaâ¦

      Iâve noticed that recently in the past few years Iâve gain a few pounds in unwanted areasâ¦ the reason behind this is 1) lack of exercise and 2) over eating. Lack of exercise is an easy fixâ¦I joined a gym and go there about 3 times a weekâ¦ as for over eating ..being from a traditional guju family it hard not to over eat.. and living in the states doesnât help.. here every fast food place has a super size optionâ¦and u feel guilty if u say no for a mare .99 cent optionâ¦ so in turn when while enjoying an over sized Veggie Whopper and super size fries and ice tea.. at bite number 4â¦ Iâm obviously full and I still have Â¾ of my burger left and all of my friesâ¦ however I slowly proceed to eat everything just cuz I feel bad throwing it out.. it weird.. I feel like crap the minute I get upâ¦ I do this at home too.. momâs have ways of stuffing their kids till they blow.. they pour fresh ghee on kitchadi not knowing that they are killing u softly with cholesterolâ¦ and they pile up rotiâs in your plate thinking that u just got out of the Somalian desert.. and my stupid dumb*ss eats it all cuz I will have to avoid another lecture on how children in Calcutta are starving.. what does that have to do with meâ¦I seriously need to understand that there is no need to over eat.. and it not my problem that in the US they serve huge portions of foodâ¦ I just have to learn that it ok to throw it out or big home a doggie bagâ¦ whatever it takes but not to take another bite after my tummy yells out .. "THATâS ENOUGH LADY!â   Question of the Dayâ¦  What do u find yourself doin that you should avoid..?

      Ok ..most of you guys know how long it takes a girl to get dressed.. it virtually takes me 4 minâ¦ I have no sense of style Monday through Fridayâ¦ I mean my whole goal is to wear clean cloths that are comfortable and that are not my pajamasâ¦ today morning came out of shower dripping wet like usual ..knowing in the back of my head if mom was around sheâd stab me with her âdhaniya cutting knifeâ for getting her carpet wet.. I opened my tiny closet and pulled out a red shirt that was recently hung on a white hangerâ¦ and yanked out a pair of blue jeansâ¦went to the dresser and pulled out fresh undies and socks ..once again only the socks matchedâ¦I have an unusual way of getting dressed I usually put on my socks before my pants I know Iâm a bit oddâ¦ when I was finally dressed I felt as if my shirt had shrunk in the dryer ..and with the new low rise jeans fashion didnât want the world to see my backside ..so I put on a long tankie underneath.. so currently Iâm wearing blue jeans, white socks, back tankie that sticks out of my red shirt and a cream colored sweater.. forgot the color of my undies ..sorry guysâ¦so itâs 1:18 pm and I feel as if I lost my sense of style.. I mean there was a time when my sleepwear used to match ..along with my undiesâ¦ I used to plan out what I was going to wear for the week during the weekend.. now itâs just whatever fits and is clean put it on.. and call it a dayâ¦   Question of the Dayâ¦?  Do you have an unusual style of getting dressedâ¦?

      A friend visited me from Connecticut yesterday and we went out to dinner then a movieâ¦ we decided to watch âThe Villageâ by M. Night Shyamalan and represent desiâsâ¦ anyways Iâm not really good with horror or suspense movies.. when I was young Iâd watch Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th.. and have nightmares for weeksâ¦ recently I seem to analyze everythingâ¦saw Blair Witch and now I have issues when I go camping.. I randomly check to make sure no one left piles of stones out side my tent ..iâm beyond paranoid.. well anyways last night watched a movie that on the scale from 1 to 10 would fall at a 7â¦ wasnât all that scary however after the movie my friend and I sat in my yard swinging on the family swing and started analyzing the film.. soon after â¦we headed to bed ..and I being nocturnal just lied there hoping that sleep will take over my lifeless bodyâ¦ while I lie in bed it is customary and a ritual that my brain runs through enormous amounts of useless information that is not even relevant to me.. so basically Iâm always thinking ..about stuff that I canât even remember the next day.. while I lied in bed around 2:20am this morning with my eyes shut tightly knowing that Iâm still awake.. I felt itâ¦ a large object behind meâ¦ I knew exactly what it was â¦the scary beast from the movie dressed in a red cloakâ¦ then I felt him grab my shoulderâ¦ I stopped breathing and waited for the hand to release my shoulderâ¦ then I screamed as loud as I could all with my eyes closedâ¦ when I opened them.. I saw my friend who was lying to my left get up and attack me with her sharp claws.. and bloody fangsâ¦.. at that point I shoved my head in a pillow and waited for all of it to stop.. I guess in the back of my head I knew it was a nightmare and I just had to let it passâ¦ about 5 min after I grabbed my cell phone and left the room.. I called up a friend and told him I just had a freaking nightmare and I had to get my mind off of it.. so we talked about silly things and I soon returned back to my room..now I was deathly afraid of sleeping in the same bed with my friend who has earlier attacked me in my nightmare..i grabbed a blanket off my bed and slept opposite the footboard on the floorâ¦every time she would twist and turn in her sleep I would turn restless.. this lasted for about an hour and a Â½..soo I finally realized why was I so scared of my friend ..big deal it was a freaking nightmare get over it.. I got back into bed and asked her if she was awake ..she stated âyahâ..and then I proceded to question her if she heard me scream.. she was like âyah but I thought I might have kicked uâ .. little did she know I was being attacked by her and the beast from the movie.. I told her about my nightmare and we laughed it offâ¦ but I think I seriously need to stop watching horror moviesâ¦ I donât think my psyche can handle and process them in a logical manner.. yes they are fun to watch but the nightmare arenât.. so from now on .. I refuse to watch horror moviesâ¦ and hopefully it will put an end to vicious nightmaresâ¦   Question of the Dayâ¦  What is it like when u have nightmareâ¦?
