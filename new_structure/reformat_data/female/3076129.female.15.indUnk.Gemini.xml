       Omg. Okay. So like, we're riding home from Kim's....and like, we're almost there when we see this black car coming for us.      Neither me or my mom pay any attention to it, right? Well....this chick jumps up (It was a convertible) WITH NO SHIRT ON!! O_O I saw her groodies!! I didn't want to!! &gt;___</post></Blog>
