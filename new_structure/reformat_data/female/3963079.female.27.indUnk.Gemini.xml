         Yawns are weird things. I mean, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we have to open our mouths and suck in some air,and we have  no  control over it. What the hell?! I mean, sure, we can try to stifle it, but that looks equally ridiculous.

       I love South Park. I also love Reno 911!. And I love Family Guy. And The Simpsons. But, I also love Futurama. And ice cream.      This is not my best blog. And that's...okay.      (Entertain yourself while I ponder a better blog:  urlLink www.huffrally.com )

        You know, we learn a lot from TV and movies, even if we don't realize it. I mean, how many times have two people come to understand a situation better because they relate it to something that they had both seen on TV or in a movie? And how many times do we end up quoting a movie or TV show (rather than a book!!) to enhance our point?            What is a movie or TV quote that you have used in everyday conversation?

        So on the way to  urlLink  work   this morning, I was thinking about the different famous people I have met. (I was, of course, inspired by  urlLink  The Dudley  Bob Morning Show  !)            Outside of concerts/shows, as far as I can remember, I have only met and/or shared the same room with:            Carl Lewis      Rob Schneider      Carson Daly      Julia Roberts      Wiley Wiggins            Hmm. I guess that's all. So far!!             So, who have  urlLink  you   met??

         Hello, all! I need some help from everybody. But it's FUN help! I have been given more responsibility in planning for my cousin's Bachelorette Party than I'd intended. So, my question for each of you is:

        Q: What do you think will be the most unlikely yet incredibly useful product or product improvement we will see in the next 10 years?

       Trebuchet. Ooh la la.        Hola, amigas (y amigos, si ellos quieren leer mi 'blog' tambiÃ©n). So, I'm sitting in a professor's office, procrastinating the start of what is sure to be a slightly dull morning. But, alas! For I have a lovely CD to listen to -     urlLink Huff Rally    . How exciting is that?! They make the morning go by so smoothly, like a walk in the park at dusk or a creamy latte with just the right amount of yummies. Okay, I have slacked enough.        More to come.

      Hi! I'm Jenn (aka FernaBear). I like coffee and talking and talking about coffee. This is my first blog! What a weird word. I wonder what the etymology of the word 'blog' is. But I don't care enough at this time to look it up. My sister is moving to New York which is, incidentally, the purpose of me starting up this blog so that we can correspond. But it has its other uses as well. Other... evil  uses! Mwa ha ha!!    Okay, more to come.    In the meantime, you should check out Huff Rally at www.huffrally.com.

         Okay, I need some help. I've just been put in charge of coming up with some fun activities/"stuff" for a Bachelorette Party. My question for each of you is:

        My coworker, Linette, has a few concerns about her cutie pie. She's currently 8 months old, attends daycare, and seems to get really sick   every two weeks  . AND the illnesses are getting worse. The pediatrician apparently makes sure that "daycare kids" are marked as such on their charts.... She does not have anyone to babysit or be a nanny and can't afford that, anyway. I really think that she's thinking about leaving us to be a stay-at-home Mom.

       Financial Aid finally responded, and I have been approved for my loans.  Whew!  But I won't be able to breathe as well as I used to until the money is actually disbursed.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I had to refer to   urlLink  www.dictionary.com    to remember if I should have written  disbursed  or  dispersed .  I could have said either, technically, but the latter would have required a bit of time to clean up.  And I'd need mace to keep people away from my money.  Poor bastards, trying to steal my money.      I would like to create on-line Mad-Libs for people.  I think that would be really fun.  I wonder how I could do that.  It would require having Web space.  And that costs money.  Think the University would fund me?  I'll call it research in humor.  Ooh!  Or  humour .  They're sure to fund me if they think it's all glam, like other European stuff, don'tcha think?  Yeah, me neither.

       I need to get a few things off of my chest.  Then life as usual may continue.  But first!       *sound of knuckles cracking in preparation*       1)  Mary , I freakin' swear, if you raise your voice to me  one  more time, I'm reporting you.      2)  Psychology Department/UTSA in general  -- Seriously.  What's the problem with losing things?!  You're far too large of a university to be so undependable.      3)  Financial Aid Department/Wells Fargo Student Loan People  -- Hi. Remember me?!  Let's get going, people!  I've done my part.  Aren't you supposed to WANT me to be eternally in debt to you?!  Give me my money!!!  Tuition is due, man.      Okay.  I feel better.

        So, I got a good laugh from a caller on Dudley and Bob today.  The topic was something like 'Shallow Reasons I Won't Vote for ______".  The caller said that, were he voting according to his shallow thoughts, he wouldn't vote for Kerry because Kerry always sounds like he's telling a ghost story.  And he wouldn't vote for Edwards because everytime Edwards does that cheesey thumbs-up thing, he looks like he's trying to flick a booger off of his thumb.

       Once, when I was driving, my folded sun visors flipped open and scared me, big time!  I thought that a raccoon had gotten into my car.      And, this morning, there was a stinky, skunky smell in the stairwell as I made my way up to the 4th floor  urlLink where I work .  So, naturally, I figured that someone must have put a rabid skunk in the stairwell as a practical joke on someone.      And the time I destroyed Steph's car with a deer?  I slammed into the deer, and it flipped over the top of the car.  But, I momentarily feared that the deer had fallen into the backseat.  (A bit Tommy Boy-esque.)      What in the world?!  Apparently my explanation for the unnatural defaults to the fact that animals are out to get me....  I think I watched too much Snow White as a kid.
