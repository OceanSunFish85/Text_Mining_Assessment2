      Dear 1/1... I am very sadden when i found out our classmates valuables is stolen by our own class people.  I am also very sadden when as a class, withoutany evidence, many pointed their fingers at Ian. I know that each of you are trying to be helpful, but we have to be careful as the culprit may use Ian to take the blame. I appeal to everyone to act in a just and fair manner. Spare a thought for others before jumping into any groundless conclusion.  I also apeal to everyone to not totake things that do not belong to you, do not accuse or suggest anything without any clue or evidence. Do help one another to take care each other's belonging. Do all you can to keep your valuables away from all potential danger, do not tempt the thief.   ur saddened form teacher :( Lena
