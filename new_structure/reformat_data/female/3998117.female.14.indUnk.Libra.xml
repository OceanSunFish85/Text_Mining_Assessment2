            FRIENDS NOW AND FOREVER              CINDYâS FIRST BOYFRIEND           â Oh!! My God I am so excited todayâs Alishaâs birthday? I canât believe sheâs inviting boys. I hate boys andâ¦.â was all that I kept saying as the evening kept coming closer and closer. Today is Alishaâs 11 th  birthday and I am beginning to feel very anxious. But the worst thing is sheâs inviting boys. Yuck!! I am Cindy Smith and I am 11 years. Alisha Graham is not my best friend but we pretty much hang around together. We live in Canley heights,        Australia    . Itâs a really cool place and we go to     Canley       Heights       Public School    . Kylie Rodriguez is my best friend and we love hanging around, shopping and of course we do a bit of studying together. I do have other friends like Petronella curk and Amelia Billick and I can tell you that even though we are 11 and supposed to be acting like âyoung ladiesâ as our parents say, we are tom boys(except one of us) and we enjoy being just the way we are.                 Alisha however doesnât behave like us any more. Its fun being around her but suddenly she acts weird. Iâve spoken to my mum about it but she tells me that Alisha is going through a phase and that sheâs growing up. She plays around with us but all of a sudden when Julian, Ian and Harry come around she acts peculiar. Last year she could stand up to them when they bullied us around and now she finds them good-looking. Yuck!!                Today Alisha is having her birthday party and she asked me to help her put up her decorations. So I said Iâll do it. I have to arrive an hour earlier so that means I have to start going in for my shower. I already chose my clothes a pair of jeans and a red top that said GIRLS RULE! Alisha helped me pick out that top; she said it matched perfectly with my brown complexion. I have brown skin and jet black hair, tall and chubby. I have no brothers or sisters and sometimes it gets lonely. Petronella and Kylie have somewhat the same features except that theyâre a bit thinner. Petronella hasnât got a brother and a dad. Kylie has a sister whoâs two years younger than her. Alisha wants to become a model when sheâs older so sheâs cut out all the chocolates and fatty stuff from her diet. Sheâs really skinny and tall but I must admit that she is prettier than the rest of us. Amelia is quiet but that doesnât mean I bully her around, she voices her opinion whenever she wants to. Kylie and Petronella are just like me weâre bold and stand up for ourselves. But Amelia is good looking too. The five of us have been friends since kindergarten and FRIENDS NOW AND FOREVER is the motto of our little group. To tell you the truth I came up with it (Iâm not boasting).                Alisha used to be like us but sheâs changing, and changing rapidly. I got ready to go and my mum said sheâd drive me over. It was a ten minute drive but I heard a ten-minute lecture as well, with things like âCindy, behave like a young girl, act decently and give us a call when the partyâs over so that I can pick you up.â âAlright mum, I know, I knowâ. Mum can be annoying sometimes that she makes me want to scream.                I arrived at Alishaâs place and I rang the door bell. It was about two seconds later till I heard Stephanieâs voice saying âIâll get it, you carry onâ   âhello steff whatâs up?â nothing much how bout you?â âNothingâ         âAlishaâs in her room, Iâve gotta run, cya later?â        âCyaâ                 Stephanie is Alishaâs older sister. Sheâs 14 and when she went out with a boy for the first time, all of us whispered to each other with words like âgrossâ, âyuckâ, and âis she crazyâ        And Alisha said the same thing but now it seems like sheâs desperate to get a boyfriend. Alisha also has an older brother and heâs 17. His name is Nathan but I donât speak to him that much because he seems to be leading a very busy life. Alishaâs sister and brother go to high school.                I went up to Alishaâs room which took me about 2mins as her house is quite big comparing to any of us. I knocked on her bedroom door which said âALISHAâS ROOMâ and below it said âPLEASE KNOCK BEFORE ENTERINGâ. Immediately a voice replied âwho is itâ and I answered back saying âitâs me Cindy can I come in?â        âYeah sureâ.                So I went in and I stood there dumbstruck with my mouth opened. I couldnât say anything, but at last when I could speak I said âWhat on earth has got into you?â   âHello Cindy, do you like my new hairdo?âAlisha had on a lovely blue dress with a red motive. But that wasnât the point, she had make-up on (a bit too much) and her lovely brown hair was now blonde. I always loved her hair but look whatâs sheâs done to it.                âWhat did you do to yourself?â I asked.                âOh! Cindy you wonât understand, steff helped me do it and I love itâ                âI donât know whatâs wrong with you but if youâre comfy with it then thatâs goodâ. Deep down inside I wished that she would come back and be normal like us.                I plonked myself on the bed and looked around and to my horror found that her bedroom was re-arranged. I was so busy looking at the birthday girl that I hadnât noticed her room. All the posters of Barbie and Winne the pooh had been pulled down and new posters of some freaky guys were up. I didnât like it at all.                âHappy birthday to meâ she started singing and it was only then that I realised that Iâd forgotten to wish her for her birthday.                âAlisha, Iâm sorry I forgotâ. Handing her a parcel wrapped up in gift wrapping paper I apologetically said âhappy 11 th  birthdayâ.                 âThatâs alright, I was just kiddingâ she said as she received it.                  She came over and I gave her a hug.â Reallyâ I asked                âAnd to get your presentâ                With that we cracked up with laughter and later she saidâ The decorations are done but I was hoping that maybe, you could help me take the food down to the rumpus room?â                â Happy to helpâ   I answered and with that we went down and laid   out the table with all kinds of sandwiches, chips, punch, biscuits, and some fruit for the birthday girl. When that was done, she checked her c.d player and all her cdâs.                 âAlisha, are you going to have dancing?â I asked hoping sheâd say no.                âOf course Cindy, everyone from our class are going to be there and everyone loves dancing so I decided Iâll have dancing after allâ.                I didnât know how to dance but I curiously asked again        âIs it going to be like a boy-girl dancing partyâ?                âMaybe, but I hope Ian is there, I want to dance with himâ she said as if she was in the seventh heaven.                I just carried on and I couldnât wait for Petronella, Kylie and Amelia to arrive.                One, by one everyone started coming in and then Kylie came in. I was so happy to see her. She was also dressed in her normal, casual clothes. Amelia and petronella also arrived soon and the party began. Alisha went over and started to chat with Ian as if he was a movie star or something. I couldnât wait for the games to begin. Iâve always loved that part of the party the best since I was small.                Alisha played some music and said âeveryone lets danceâ. It was a slow number and it had to be a waltz. Everyone somehow found partners including my friends. âWhat are you guys doing?â I asked Kylie and Petronella as they got up to dance with James and Daniel. But they just shrugged and went off. Amelia sat close to me, and I thought at least one person agrees with me but soon Mike came over and asked her if he could have a dance and she went all pink all over her face but in the end said yes.                I was so mad with my friends; some of the kids were just watching so I just stood there with a sandwich in my hand and waited till the song was over. Later everyone resumed to their places and started chatting but I totally went mad and asked Kylieâ Do you know what youâve done nowâ. And she saidâ oh!! Come on Cindy it was fun, I liked it, and James and I got to know each other better and weâre going out to the movies next weekendâ.                I just stood there and said nothing, what could I do? All my friends are acting indifferent and I even wondered if they were the same people I met years ago. Then Alisha said âIâm dying to know what youâll bought me so can you gather around to open up my presents? Everyone got into a circle and she opened up Simonâs gift, it was a notebook with stars all over it. Then Petronella gave her a pen, Kylie bought her a brooch, Amelia got her an alarm clock which was in the shape of an A. Alisha got tons of gifts like   necklaces, bracelets, earrings, autograph books, photo albums, story books and she kept sayingâ its lovely, I love it, its beautiful, very sentimentalâ. Obviously mine was the last one to be opened as I was the first to arrive and I was waiting for her to look at mine and say âI love itâ.                I bought her a t-shirt with Barbie on it and I thought it would be perfect. But after seeing her bedroom after a long time I wasnât so sure. She tore open the paper and said â its niceâ in a very sarcastic way but I knew now that she didnât welcome it but I just pretended I didnât care   but deep down I was hurt and wanted to cry.                 We had a little more dancing and then she said in a bold voice âeverybody weâre going to have a gameâ        âA game, donât you think thatâs a bit childishâ Pamela blurted out but I was happy until Alisha said âNot any game, its spin the bottleâ. With that everyone got into a circle without being told except me. I just stood there, and Alisha came over to me and said âDonât make a scene, or ruin my party, just playâ. For the first time ever I just agreed and played along but I felt miserable.                Each time anyone kissed anyone I murmured to myself sayingâ yuckâ. Even Amelia and Kylie had a turn. It was my turn next and I hate boys, now I had to kiss one âgo on Cindyâ Alisha said with a look in her eyes that meant donât be daft just have a go. I spun the bottle and it landed on Calvin, one of the boys in my class. Its not that I hated Calvin, I liked him but only as a friend.                Actually I was the one who had to make the first move but surprisingly he did and I went mad, so mad that I stood up and said âI hate this stupid party, I canât believe I came, I hate it, have a nice time Alishaâ and I stormed out of the room expecting someone to come behind me but no one really did. I went up to the living room and saw mrs.Graham there. âWhatâs wrong love?â but all I could say wasâ would it be okay if I used your telephone?â                 I reckon she must have guessed that something was bothering me and I didnât actually want to mention it so she said âAlright love, itâs over thereâ and pointed to my right. I replied in my politest voice saying âThank youâ and went over and dialled mumâs mobile number and asked her if she could pick me up now? She said sheâll be there in another 15 minutes so I sat down on the couch and watched the hands of the clock turn slowly. 15 minutes seemed like forever.                 Mum arrived and I thanked mrs.Graham and got into the car. The first question was âHow was the party, Cindyâ.        âGoodâ I replied.                âIs there something that you would like to tell meâ she asked. At that moment I felt my face turning red and hot tears swell up and before I knew it those tears came trickling down my face. I couldnât stop crying and I knew mum was getting worried so as soon as I went home I asked her if I can be excused from dinner and I went straight to my room, got into my pjâs ready to go to bed when mum knocked on my bedroom door.                Mum always comes to speak to me when she knows Iâm worried and sometimes it helps but right now I really didnât think it would. âCome inâ I answered. She came right in and said âCindy, are you alright? Your eyes are puffed up.â                âIâm fine mumâ                âYou know sweetie, if you donât want to talk thatâs alrightâ                At that moment I felt that I could speak to mum and I told her all that had happened. Mum always understands how I feel and gives me good advice.                She listened without interrupting me and at last she spoke sayingâ I know that this is a very hard time for you Cindy but this is a time when things change. May-be your friends are just growing up and realising things before you, that doesnât mean anythingâs wrong with you but eventually you will be just like them soonâ                âI donât want things to change, I still want to play with dolls and teddy bears, I donât want to talk about boys and make up, and it feels as if Iâm loosing my friendsâ                âI know Cindy, but trust me, it will be different soon.â                âDo you reckon what I done was wrongâ I asked                âWell yes, I guess, but if you call Alisha tomorrow and explain everything to her, she may understand itâ                âI guess so too, I feel guilty now, but I feel much better after having this little chat with you, thanks mumâ                 She came over and gave me a hug. I really felt better and I went to bed. The next morning I got up, although I felt guilty and I wanted to speak to Alisha I didnât feel like I wanted but I knew I had to.                        I had a wash and went downstairs with the intention to call Alisha but a surprise awaited me there. âSurpriseâ         And I really felt relieved for some reason to see my friends. Mum also was there and I certainly didnât want to apologise in front of mum so I said âcan we go up to our roomâ. âWait a secâ Kylie replied and lifted up a big brown paper bag.                When we went upstairs, everyone was silent, then I broke the silence by saying âAlisha, Iâm sorry I spoilt your bir- thday party, I wasâ¦.â But before I could finish Kylie opened the brown paper back and brought out chips and a few sandwiches âthese are the remains from yesterday, I thought maybe we could have a little chat.         âWhereâs petronella?â I asked        âShe has a dentistâs appointmentâ Alisha answered.                For the first time today Amelia saidâ Iâm sorry Cindy, we should have been with you, instead we went off dancing and playing. â Look you guys, I know that I still act like a little kid but that doesnât mean you have to be like me, I know someday soon Iâll be like youâll and Iâm waiting for that day but I still want to be a little girl and I want us to remain friends foreverâ I replied.                The room went silent again and then Alisha came over   and put her arm around me and said â Cindy its alright even though we realise certain things before you weâll still be your friendsâ .                âReallyâ        âYeah of courseâ.                We started talking about what programs would be on TV and Kylie all of a sudden started grinning which brought suspicion upon all of us.        âSpit it out Kylieâ I said                âCindy, Iâm not sure if youâre going to like this butâ¦â        âWhat, hurry upâ                âYesterday when you spun the bottle, you were supposed to go forward to kiss Calvin but he came forward instead.â                âSoâ I asked                âLater he told me that he wants to go out with you because he liked youâ                I started to blush and I felt like I was on the top of the world. âYesâ                Alisha then said âso we answered for you, saying yesâ                 âIâm going out with Ian on Saturday and so are Kylie and James and Petronella and Daniel and Amelia and Mike. So we decided that we like to all go out togetherâ.        âIt will be fun Cindyâ Amelia said                Again I felt happy and I said âI have to ask mum, just a secâ. I darted down and saw mum sewing.âMum will it be okay if I go out with my friends and another friend this weekend to the movies?â                âWhoâs this other friend?â                âCalvin, he asked me out so I want to go outâ?                âSweetie, are you doing this just so you can keep your friends?â                âNo mum, I feel different now, can I go?â                âIf you feel comfy with itâ.                I was so happy and Alisha couldnât believe her eyes. We started talking about what we would wear and Alisha persuaded me that sheâd do my makeup.                 Saturday finally came and mum picked out a blue top with silver hearts all over it. It looked really pretty. Mum said sheâd drop me off. When I saw my friends there I was relieved. I said bye to mum and gave her a quick kiss and went. I saw everyone there and then I saw Calvin, my heart skipped a beat. He looked gorgeous in his jeans and t-shirt. He held a red rose in his hand and kept smiling at me.                âThis is for youâ he said, handing me the rose âand you look prettyâ                âThank you and I like your pair of jeansâ I replied.                Immediately Alisha whispered in my ear âyuck!! Look whoâs going out with a boy and telling him he looks good tooâ.                âStop it Alishaâ I replied but I could feel myself blushing.                âLetâs get going, the movieâs starting in about 5 minutes and Iâve bought the ticketsâ Alisha said.                âWhere are Petronella and Daniel?â I asked                âThey are in alreadyâ. Amelia replied.                We went in and found our seats easily, off course I was seated next o Calvin.                The lights went out and the movie started but instead of watching Calvin and I were chatting, till someone from behind shoutedâ will you two down there shut upâ.                So I suggested that we go and have something to eat. âAlisha, weâre going out down to the cafÃ©, meet us up thereâ and we went up to the cafÃ©. On the way Calvin and I were speaking about lots of stuff and then in the course of conversation he askedâ What happened yesterday? Was it because you have never kissed anyone before or anything else?â        âYes Iâve never kissed anyone before and I guess I was not readyâ. I didnât want to tell him the actual reason, what if he thought if I was weird or anything?â.                âCan I tell you somethingâ he said        âWhatâs that, Calvin?â                âI really like you, Cindy and its okay if you havenât had your first kiss because Iâve never had one tooâ.                I was surprised but I just said as calm as I could âCalvin, you seem like a pretty cool guy and I like you tooâ.                He smiled and before I could say anything else he leant over and kissed me. I felt as if I could scream. I just smiled and suddenly we saw everyone else come into the cafÃ©.                âIs the movie over already, Petronella?â I asked                âNo but weâre boredâ.                The evening went of perfectly; mum said sheâd pick me up at 8.00. The others had their parents to pick them up too and one by one everyone else left except Calvin and myself. He said heâll wait till my mum comes. Mum finally arrived and before I could go he said âCindy, I had fun, and can we go out some other time?â                âI had fun too and I hope we go out again, byeâ. I quickly gave him a kiss on the cheek and ran to the car.                As soon I was strapped mum asked me âhow was your eveningâ?                 âExcellent mum, I loved itâ.        âThatâs good, sweetheart, was that Calvin standing there with you?â        âYeah mum, he said heâll wait with me till you comeâ                âThatâs nice of him, ask him to come home sometime and have dinnerâ.                Mum kept on talking but I was wondering why I had spoken about boys so badly, some of them are really nice.                The next day Alisha, Kylie, Petronella and Amelia came over to my place and we just kept chatting about yesterday. âyou guys Iâm sorry, I didnât understand that it can be fun to hang around boys, but Iâm happy cos I had a nice time yesterday, my first date, my first kiss and â¦â¦â¦â.                âWait a minute, you didnât tell us anything about your first kissâ Petronella said                âDidnât I, I thought I didâ I replied as casually as I could but I couldnât help blushing.                They wanted to know exactly every little detail so I told them and when we were finished, Alisha saidâ I told you, you will be like us soon and soon has comeâ                âI know I said, and it feels great to have such good friends like youâll to chat to. Thanks â                Kylie said âfriends foreverâ                Yeah we all replied âfriends foreverâ.                So it was fun and I wouldnât change my friends a bit cos I really liked them. It was great to be friends again and to tell you the truth it does feel great to hang around boys especially boys like Calvin.                THE END                                                            Its Alishaâs 11 th  birthday and our five friends are having a disagreement, while Cindy thinks boys are yuck, the others seem to say its fun to hang around boys. Things are changing rapidly for the five of them. What will happen next?

             HIGH SCHOOL AT LAST                                        âThatâs it I had it young lady, no more talking about thisâ dad said almost shouting. âBut dadâ¦â I said âThatâs not fairâ.                 âJessica, could you pass me the peanut butterâ dad spoke completely ignoring my statement.                   With that I had to rest my case but I still think that itâs unfair. There is the mega problem that has just exploded in my house partly because of me, well the whole problem is because of me (I canât help it).                I guess youâre still confused with all this stuff. Let me explain this more clearly. Iâm Kylie Rodriguez and I live in      Canley Heights       Australia    . Itâs a wonderful place in fact it seems like the best place on earth and I go to Canley Heights Primary School which is the best school on earth but it wonât be too long before I have to leave this amazing school. Itâs like this we (my friends and I) went to this school since Kindergarten and we love it but they get to go to     Canley       Heights       High School     (all four of them) and I have to go to     Canterbury       High School     which is about an hourâs drive from here. And I donât want to go.                My friends are Amelia, Alisha, Petronella and Cindy along with my boyfriend James. We are all 13 (at least most of us). Cindy is best friend and has been my best friend since forever and sheâs really the best, best friend any one can have, she has black hair with brown complexion and jet black hair, sheâs a bit chubby and tall. She has no dad or brothers or sisters and lives with her mum. Excepting the fact that that she gets really angry very easily sheâs pretty cool. Then my next friend is Alisha she used to get really snobbish at first but I think Petronella rubbed her edges of her and now sheâs just okay. She loves to sing and dance and when she grows up she wants to become a model, gosh she will be perfect for that job because sheâs really skinny and a very fair complexion.   Alisha has an elder sister and an elder brother.                Petronella has a brother; well heâs not her real brother but her step brother-Mark. She used to live with her mum alone but then her mum started dating and now that guy (Nathan) has moved in with them and they are deciding their wedding which will be in a couple of weeks.   They first decided a date and then they postponed the date. Petronella has lime complexion with brownish- blackish hair and is very studious and she loves reading just like me.                 The next friend of mine is Amelia, whoâs the quietest person in our group. She has a step brother and she lives with her adopted parents. Amelia also has lime complexion and light brown hair. She loves reading but she doesnât read stuff like me she reads books on animals. When she grows up she wants to become a Vet (a doctor for animals).                         âKylie, look whoâs hereâ Jessica called out. Well I almost forgot I have a sister and I live with both my parents. Jessicaâs 9 and she goes to the same Primary school as me. We get along together most of the time except that sheâs always the genius of the family and off course the baby of the family. She always gets most of the attention and I donât.   Iâm usually not the jealous type except when it comes to her.                 âWho is it?â I shouted back.        âCome down and seeâ she called back.                She can be   very tantalising at times and it annoys me. I ran down as fast as I could and there I could see my mum and dad speaking to a girl whose back was turned towards me and I couldnât help but scream âAngelaâ. Angela has always been my favourite cousin and she helps me sort out my problems just by talking to me. She has black long hair and brown complexion.   It had been a long time since Iâve seen her because she lives in     Melbourne     and she rarely visits but we have lots of fun when she comes even though she is about ten years older to me.                   âKylieâ she greeted me âhow are youâ. âIâm goodâ I replied and I ran over to her and hugged and kissed her.                 âHow are you?â I asked âwhen did you arrive? How long are you â¦â I began when Jessica interrupted me âDonât you think she needs time to relax Kylie after her long flightâ.                âBratâ I muttered under my breath. But just as I looked up my dadâs eyes were on me so I just smiled and spoke âUmâ¦ actually yes I think you do Angela, Iâm sorryâ.                 âThatâs okayâ she replied âIâm staying over for the next week or two because Iâm changing jobs and I thought Iâll have a break before starting over at my new jobâ.                 âAwesomeâ I replied âWe can have tons of fun together this timeâ.                âWell I donât think Angela will want to spend lots of time with you this time because Ken has come with herâ mum said.                âKen!! Whoâs Ken?â I asked.                âKen is my boy friend and heâs come down from     Melbourne     and heâs staying at one of his friends placeâ Angela said.                âOkayâ I said. I think my voice must have sounded exactly how I felt-disappointed because immediately Angela said in a rather kind voice âWe can still do some of the stuff together, but not as much as we used toâ.                âGreatâ I replied trying to sound cheerful and trying to smile but I knew that Angela wouldâve known that I was still a bit disappointed. Everything settled down and the evening came, James my boy friend called up. Weâve been going out for eight months.                âKylieâ he asked.                âJamesâ I replied                âHow are you?â he asked.                âIâm good thank you, how are you?â                 âOh Iâm okay, listen I was wondering if you want to go out for a drink of coke or something at McDonaldâsâ he asked.                âSureâ I replied âMeet you at the end of the street in ten minutesâ.                âSee you thenâ he said and hung up.                I took out my jumper because it was a bit windy and I didnât want to catch a cold. It was about five in the evening and it was already turning a bit dark.                âMum, dadâ I called out âIâm going down to McDonaldâs with James nowâ.                âWhat time will you return?â I could hear mum ask..        âIn an hour or soâ I replied.                Immediately Jessica came down to me and asked âCan you bring me a cheese burger and some chips?â                âJessicaâ I replied âIâm going out with a boy and heâs paying; what do you want me to ask? âCan you buy my little sister a burger?â I donât think soâ.                âHereâs the money Kylieâ Angela said appearing on the scene âYou neednât ask him for the money, you can get a burger for your sister yourselfâ.                âButâ¦â I tried to speak but I couldnât think of anything to say.                âBut what? She asked.                âOkayâ I replied and taking the money from her âSpoilt bratâ I muttered under my breath.                âI heard thatâ Jessica said âAngela, did you hear that?â                 âYes, I didâ Angela replied âAnd Iâm a bit worried about Kylieâs behaviourâ.                âMy behaviourâ I asked âI donât think thereâs anything wrong with my behaviour or even if there is, it wouldnât be happening if this little brat wants everything she seesâ.                âKylie stop that nonsenseâ Angela said in a tone that really she meant what she said âSheâs your sister and whatâs wrong with her asking for something?â                âEverythingâ I replied âI canât go out with some of my friends and there she is asking for something or worrying to comeâ.                âYour so annoying Jessâ I said with a change in my tonality.                âGet going will youâ Angela said looking at me and then turning to Jessica she said âJess, letâs play monopoly now, can we?â                âSheâs such a looserâ I mutter to myself.         âStop that now, Kylie, will you?â Angela said.                I just walked out of the house and kept thinking all the way how Angela spoke to me and I realised that I felt really hurt and I started crying but as I came close to McDonaldâs I wiped my tears away and when I saw James I tried my best to smile but he knew at once that something was wrong and gave me a hug as soon as I came. I went closer to him then he kissed me.                âWhatâs wrong?â he asked.                âNothingâ I replied ânothing at allâ.                âReally?â he asked âThen why is   your face tearstained   and your eyes all redâ.                âI just had a little fightâ I replied trying not to start crying.                âWith whom?â he asked.                âCan we not talk about this?â I asked.                âFineâ he replied âThatâs okayâ.                Just then I noticed how hurt he felt and I didnât want to fight with every one today. âJamie, Iâm sorryâ I started âI didnât mean to hurt you or anything and actually I do   need someone to talk to right nowâ.                âThatâs okay Kylieâ he replied âYou can talk to me anytime you want okayâ and taking my hand we went inside.                 we got our stuff and we sat down.                âWhatâs wrongâ he started.                âMy cousin Angela has come down from     Melbourne     and she has a boy friendâ I said.                âWhatâs wrong with that?â James asked.                âNothingâs wrong with that but now we had a fight and guess whose side she tookâ I asked.                âJessâsâ he asked.                âYes, canât believe she above all people, we used to be best friends and now it seems so differentâ I said trying to eat the burger that I had in my hand.                âWhy, what did you do?â James asked as he was sipping on his coke.                 âItâs a silly thing, umâ¦ Jess wanted me to get her a burger and I said that I was going out and I canât but as soon as I said I canât Angela came on the scene and handing over the money to me she said that I had to and then when I called Jess a brat she â¦ she..â I couldnât say anything more because I was choked.                Slowly James took my hand and spoke slowly âOh!! Donât worry Kylie, itâs such a small thing Angela will probably forget about it by the time your home.                âShe probably willâ I said but I wished I could really believe that. We finished our snack and I got Jessica a burger with some French fries and I started on my way home.                 When I arrived Jessica came running to me âSo you did get it, thanksâ she said and snatched the stuff out of my hand.                 âHow was your date?â Angela asked as she came into the living room.                âNot too badâ I replied âAt least I had some peace of mind which I donât seem to be getting hereâ.                âYou know, even I get peace of mind when Iâm out with Ken, it feels great doesnât it?â she asked as if nothing had happened. But I was hurt, terribly hurt and I wasnât just going to let this drift by.                 âYeah, whateverâ I replied and started walking out of the living room.                âWhatâs her problem?â   I heard Jessicaâs voice.                âProbably a bad dateâ Angela replied and both of them giggled. I felt my cheeks go red and I started crying. I canât believe Angelaâs changed so much.                 This Ken guy must have done something to her because this is not the Angela I know. That night after dinner I went up to my room and took out a magazine to read, it was a Girlfriend magazine. As I was reading someone knocked on my door âWho is it?â I asked.   âKylie, itâs me Angelaâ.                âCome inâ I replied.        Angela came into the room and plonked herself on my bed âSoâ she began âWas there any problem?â                âProblem?â I asked feeling a bit edgy.                 âYesâ she said âWith your date with Jamesâ.                âOne, it was not a date, two, there was no problem, the only problem I have is having a younger sisterâ I replied.                âKylie, câmon your sister is not all that bad, you should be proud of her sheâs such a talented girl, did she tell you about that math...â Angela started.                But I cut her short âAngela, I know my sisterâs a genius and I know that Iâm aâ¦ what do you say â¦ a dummy but you donât have to keep telling me thatâ.                âWho said youâre dumb, I justâ¦â she began again but once again I cut her short âWell, how come you have time for me any ways, shouldnât you be spending time with Jessica?â                âKylie, you are acting like nothing but a spoilt little brat which youâre normally not but at the end of the day itâs left up to youâ she said âI just came here to tell you that Iâm going back on Monday and Iâll be back here next weekâ.                âBut we havenât spent any time togetherâ I started but she was already walking out of my room âSorry, but I guess itâs your faultâ.                My fault, how can it be my fault, it cannot be my fault, what did I do. All these problems started only because of Jessica.                âJessicaâ I shouted as I stormed into her bedroom only to find Angela sitting there and talking to her so as usual I stopped.                âYesâ Kylie said in a sarcastic tone because Angela was there.                âI was wondering if you saw my penâ I said in a nervous tone.                âNoâ I didnât she replied.                âKylie, do you want to play monopoly with usâ Angela asked.                Something told me that I had to play; besides monopoly was one of my favourite games. âYeah!! Okayâ I said at last.                Angela smiled at me and then she looked at Jess and said âJess, you said you had some studying to do for that great math quiz, I think you should study now, I want to spend some time with Kylieâ.                I immediately knew that Angela wanted to talk to me in private. âKylie, do you mind if I use your room for a whileâ Jessica asked.                âGo ahead, so long as you donât steal anythingâ I replied sarcastically.                Jessica left and I was just looking around her room. Her room is always neat and tidy and certificates stuck all over the walls. âLook at all thisâ I said looking at Angela âSheâs so smartâ.                âCome sit over hereâ Angela said motioning me to Jessicaâs bed âEveryoneâs smartâ.                I let out a sarcastic laugh and said âI wish I were like her, getting so many things and having mum and dad say such good things about meâ then I stopped âI canât believe Iâm saying all of this, now I can be officially called not only a dummy but a jealous sisterâ.                âKylieâ Angela started âEvery one gets jealous at some time, and everyone is good at somethingâ.                âHow come Iâm not good at anythingâ I asked.                âYou are good at something, it takes time for some people to learn what their talents areâ Angela said âEven Jessicaâs a bit jealous of youâ.                âOf me?â I asked âBut sheâs the clever one, what do I have for her to get jealous of me?â                âWell, look you may not be extremely studious or anything but look at how many friends you have, look how social you are?â Angela said âBecause sheâs so good at everything itâs so hard on her when examinations are close, like, if she fails then your parents would be disappointed but if you do they are always there encouraging you to do better and besides your parents know your capability so donât worryâ.                Angela does give such good advice and itâs hard not to believe it. Then the moment she mentioned friends I became sad, I think she knew that so again she said âYouâre thinking about your friends arenât you?â                âYesâ I replied âIâm going to miss them so much and Iâm going to miss Jamesâ.                âI know how it feelsâ she said âI felt the same way when I left year-12, it was so hard but after a while I went to college and I met new friends, then when I had to leave college again I had to leave those friends and I made new friends at work and now I left those friends and Iâm going to make new friends at my new work spotâ.                âBut arenât you scared youâll loose your friends?â I asked, the thought of my friends leaving me flashing before me.                âIf itâs true friendship, trust me itâll be there foreverâ she said âI know itâs hard but life is always like that, meeting friends then leaving them and then making new friends itâs like aâ¦. aâ¦.. Cycleâ.                âTrueâ I said thinking hard about that âWhat about James? You know heâll be in a different high school and I wonât know whatâs going on, if heâs meeting any other girls and... What if he gets a new girlfriend?â                âKylie, youâre still in primary school and youâre only thirteen, if he finds a new girlfriend, well thenâ¦. May be youâll find someone else later, after all there are many fish in the seaâ.                I was asking her about boys not fish, canât she speak so that I can understand âWhat fish?â I asked.                âWell itâs a grammatical phrase that there are so many there boys out there and you got so many years to go, or if you want this relationship to work out, then you got to trust him and heâs got to trust youâ she replied.                Then it seemed clearer to me. âI hope it does work outâ I said.                âMay be it will, in the mean time donât give your parents such a hard time just go to your new school and give it a shotâ she said.                âYeah!! I willâ I said âAnd Angela sorry about the time I was umâ¦ rude toâ.                âThatâs okayâ she said kindly âAnd do you think you should apologise to Jessica?â                âShould Iâ I asked thinking carefully.                âItâs up to youâ she said âOh and another thing, did you have a fight with James because I can make out that you had cried beforeâ.                How can she make out, I didnât want to tell her that her words hurt me, or should I tell her?                 âNo, there was no problem at allâ I said slightly stammering âI was just umâ¦ hurt a bit when you were taking Jessâs sideâ.                I looked at her in the eye and she said âWell when youâre in the right Iâll be on your side and when youâre in the wrong Iâll tell you straight awayâ.                Angela was always like that, sheâll tell you how she feels straight away âYeah, okayâ I replied and went out of the room and into my room.                âHey Jess, howâs the math going?â I asked.                âGreat, I just love maths, itâs so much funâ she replied.                Math fun, I hate math so much its sickens me to death and Iâll be lucky if I get a C.                âGreatâ I said going closer to her âListen, about the burger thing, Iâm reallyâ¦â                But she cut me short âThatâs okay, can you help me out here with this problem, I canât seem to figure it out, I keep getting 26.2 instead of 24.2â she said pointing to a sum on her book which looked like Greek to meâ.                But just then I looked at the problem a bit more in detail and read and re-read and I figured that I could figure it out âLook, I said you made a mistake you forgot to subtract 2 hereâ I said.                âOh yesâ she replied âHow silly of me, anyways thanks a lot now Iâve got to go through chapter sevenâ and she went out of my room.                Now I had a perfect idea since it was Saturday tomorrow I thought that may be I could ask Angela to come with me to get my formal outfit. I immediately ran out of my room to Jessâs room âAngelaâ I said âCan you come with me tomorrow to get my formal outfitâ I asked.                âUmâ¦. Iâ she began and I knew it would be a no âI was thinking of taking Ken out for lunchâ.                âOkay fineâ I said a bit disappointed.                âIâll tell you after I call Kenâ she said.                âYou donât have to not go because of meâ I said although I wished she could not go.                âIâll tell you in a whileâ she said.                After a while she came into my room and said âI canât break off my date with Kenâ. Thatâs it I thought Iâm never going to spend time with her.                âButâ she said, I hate when people say but and they donât come to the actual thing that I want to know âYou and Jess can come alongâ.                âCool!!â I said âThank youâ and I gave her a hug.                 The next day we went shopping and I had a tough decision on what to buy, I think it aggravated Ken a lot because he told us to keep shopping and heâll meet us in the food court when weâre finished. First Angela thought that a red dress with silver roses would fit me nicely but then Jessica said that I should go with a pink dress, finally I settled down with a neon blue velvet dress which was plain. Both Angela and Jessica said it was too plain but I liked it so I got that dress. Then later we went down to the food court and had fish and chips. It was a lovely day on the whole and I was glad.                That week went off perfectly and it was really sad that Angela had to leave but she said sheâll try to come later. School also was going on perfectly. One day at school James, and all of my other friends were having lunch together âKylie did you get your formal dress as yet?â   Alisha asked as she was eating her sandwich.                âYesâ I replied âI got Angela to help me outâ.                âCan I come over and see it?â Cindy asked.                âSureâ I replied âIn fact I have an ideaâ.                âWhatâ everyone asked.                âWellâ I replied âI donât think we can include the boys on this planâ.                Immediately the boyâs faces went down because they always seemed to like what stuff we do (not that they are girly or anything).                âWho cares?â Alisha said.                âHeyâ Ian her boyfriend said âWe doâ.                âSorry guysâ I said âBut I was wondering, if we girls could all meet up at my place and dress up and look at ourselvesâ.                âGreatâ Petronella said.                âIâ¦â Amelia started in a quavery voice.                âWhatâs wrongâ Cindy asked.                âIâ¦ wonât be able to comeâ she blurted out and then looked at Mikeâs (her boyfriend) face and he had a puzzled look on his face.                âWhyâ Mike asked still trying to figure out what was wrong.                âBecause Iâ she began âItâs Davidâs first birthday and Iâve been saving up since forever and if I buy my dress I wonât be able to get him a little bed of his ownâ.                âWellâ Alisha said âWe can always put our cash in together canât we?â she said looking at us.                âSureâ all of us chorused including all the boys.                âThanksâ she said âBut I donât think I can let youâllâ.                Just then Alison one of the girls in our class who always likes to pick on us came close to us and said âWell, look who doesnât have money to get her own dressâ she said.                âWell at least sheâs got good friends to help her Alisonâ Alisha retorted, Alisha and Alison never got along with each other since kindergarten. Alison just let out a haughty sigh and left.                 âAmelia, weâre going to get you a dress no matter whatâ Cindy said and looked at us gesturing us to say something supportive so I began âAmelia, you have to get a new dress, this formal comes once in a life time and you just have to get a new dressâ.                âAre you sure?â she asked us.                âCourse we areâ Petronella put in.                We kept chatting for a while âYou know something Iâve always wanted to go to high school, I thought itâll be cool but now I know Iâm going to miss this school a lotâ I said thinking hard about it.                âYeah me tooâ Alisha said âAnd Stephanie said that the teachers in high school are not as easy going as they are in primaryâ.                âButâ I said âThey canât be that bad, Iâm going to miss all of youâll so much thoughâ.                Immediately Amelia whoâs always the most sensitive in our group began to cry. âPlease Ameliaâ Cindy said âyouâre going to make us all cry nowâ and she couldnât speak any more because she was choked.                âNot you tooâ Alisha said ânow Iâm going toâ¦â and she too was wiping her eyes, one by one all of us started crying (excepting the boys).                âLook on the bright sideâ Ian started âWeâre all going to be togetherâ¦â then he stopped because obviously he forgot that I wasnât going with them âSorry Kylieâ he said feeling a bit guilty.                âThatâs okayâ I replied and then I thought about me going into high school alone without knowing anyone and the more I thought about it the more I felt sad and depressed.                âStop acting all mushy nowâ I said wiping away a tear âWeâll still be friends and weâll still get to meet each otherâ.                âI only hope youâll donât forget meâ I said againâ and this time I meant it for all my friends but especially James. He must have figured that I meant it for him because he said âWe wonât and if we doâ¦â then he   paused âNo; we wonâtâ.                Just then   the bell rang and we had to get to class, during the English period our teacher Mr. McKenzie said âI donât think weâll be having our normal lessonsâ. Immediately everyone started booing because normally when he says stuff like that it means that weâre having a test.                âHold on a secâ he started again âWeâre not having a testâ then the class quietened down âIâm just going to talk to youâll about leaving primary school, I know itâs going to be hard to leave primary school and high school may be a little bit different from primary school, like now youâll have to stay in one class but in high school you have to move around from one class to another each periodâ.                Thatâs all that I heard because I was sad   and miserable and worst off all I was scared. James was sitting across the room and flashed me a smile (a sympathetic smile) and I managed a weak smile. Finally class was over and I walked to the front gate because mum said that sheâll pick up Jessica and myself after school.                 âHey Kylieâ Jessica said.                âHeyâ I replied.                âKylie, you know the math quiz I was preparing forâ she began and I kept telling myself not to get jealous because I knew that she would have got a high mark.                âYeah, what about it?â I asked.                âI got a 100%â she replied.                âThatâs greatâ I said âGuess all that studying paid offâ.                âAre you okay?â she asked.                âYeah, course I amâ                âYour sad arenât youâ she enquired even more eagerly.                âSad? Me? No wayâ I replied.                âItâll be okayâ she said âYouâre only going there because it may be more fun thereâ.                âThanksâ I said âMumâs hereâ and both of us ran towards the car and mum did enquire about my day but I just said âIt was okayâ. The rest of the drive was all about Jess but I didnât worry because my thoughts were only revolving around my friends and James.                The next day my friends were coming over and I tidied my room and bought heaps of snacks; usually Iâd go to Jessica and tell her in a loud voice not to come near my room but this time I went over to her room and knocked on her door âcome inâ she said.                âHi Jessicaâ I said.                âJessica I um... came over to ask you if you could give my friends and us some privacy because..â she cut me short âDonât worry I wonâtâ she said.                Just then I remembered what Angela had said about Jessica getting jealous of me having so many friends âJess you know what? Actually I do want you to come and join usâ.                âReallyâ she asked with a brightened expression on her face âYou donât mindâ.                âYes, come but can you come after a while not right now?â                âThank youâ she exclaimed and came over and gave me a hug, Jessica and I donât hug that much and it rarely happens.                After a while my friends arrived and we were   talking and chatting and I informed my friends that Jessica would be coming and they were actually cool with it (much to my surprise). Jessica came in and she was having a lovely time with my friends and we tried on our dresses and it was simply splendid.                The week drifted by very quickly and the last day of school was really sad, most of the kids were crying and I couldnât stop myself from crying all day. James kept on saying stuff like âItâll be alrightâ and âIâll still be your best friendâ and it made me sadder when he hugged me.                 I made it a point to speak to all my teachers (even the ones I disliked). Most of the teachers gave me good advice and told me that theyâll never forget me (As if they wouldnât?)                The evening of our formal came. I was busy getting ready with Jessica helping me out. I brushed my black hair and tossed it across my shoulders then I put on some jewellery and last of all the make up but I think I overdone the   make up part because when I arrived at the school gym James kept staring at me in awe. He looked really cute in his tuxedo. âWhatâs wrong?â I asked.                âNothingâ he replied still staring at me âYouâ¦ umâ¦ lookâ.                âScaryâ I helped him out.                âYesâ he said âCan you go and chip some of it offâ.                âOkayâ I said and took out a tissue and looking at a mirror in the hall way I took off everything.                âIs that better?â I asked standing in front of James.                âMuch better angelâ he replied.                 Angel, he called me an angel I couldâve fainted right there but I knew I mustnât be giddy headed and I must act mature so I just said thank you. As soon as I went inside I spotted Cindy and Alisha standing in a corner and perving over some of the guys (who were not their boy friends).                 âAlisha, Cindyâ I squealed and went over to them they looked so beautiful in their outfits âYouâll look so beautifulâ I told them. âLook at youâ Cindy said. âYou look great yourselfâ Alisha put in. Alisha had this beautiful green dress which was strapless and Cindy had on a black dress which was short sleeved dress with sequence all over it and she had her hair left loose which she kept tossing over her shoulders all the time. My neon blue outfit looked a bit plain comparing to theirs because my outfit was plain and it was a long dress but I liked it.   The best thing was that we looked even better then than we had the other night.                âIs Amelia and Petronella here as yet?â I asked.                âThere they areâ Alisha said pointing; when I turned around I could see Petronella and Amelia walking towards us chatting and giggling on their way. Petronella had her brownish black hair tied up a bun and a huge clip keeping it up and her peach coloured dress threw out perfectly on her. Amelia looked good too except that she was the only one who wasnât wearing make up (She hates make up) but her lime coloured tight fitting dress suited her nicely (we managed to get her a dress at last).                 âYouâll look fantasticâ I said as they came closer. âThanksâ both of them said âBut I think we spoilt the surprise by rehearsing it beforehandâ Amelia said. âI think so tooâ Petronella said.                âThanks you guysâ I said sarcastically âAfter all it was my ideaâ.                âStop itâ Alisha said âWeâre only playing around. Amelia suddenly looked a bit sad âWhatâs wrong Amelia?â Cindy asked. âI was just wondering if weâd be friends forever or will this end when we go to high schoolâ. âOff course it wonâtâ I said âWeâre friends from little and we canât just forget about each other or can we?â                 âIâm going to miss youâ Cindy said looking at me âWeâve always been in the same class Kylie and now we wonâtâ. She looked so gloomy and very soon I knew that sheâll start bawling her eyes out âCome on you guysâ I said âWeâre going to be friends forever and ever, now we have this last partyâ¦â and I couldnât continue because I was choked then I tried my best not to cry and thank god I succeeded âLetâs not cry nowâ I said âAmelia, stop crying and you too Cindy, Petronella not you too, Alisha please, come on donât youâll want me to enjoy my last party?â                At last all of them stopped crying, the music started Mr. Tinter our school principal started speaking âGood evening everyoneâ he began âItâs nice to see all your bright and happy faces and I must tell you that Canley is going to miss all those happy facesâ he kept speaking and James came over from across the room and stood next to me with his arm around me and we began listening to Mr. Tinter speak âYouâll have been excellent students even though a bit naughty at times, and I wonât keep youâll long from enjoying yourselves but I just like to get one message across, I hope that youâll have had a lovely time Canley, and I hope youâll learnt something from this school and I hope youâll carry on this good reputation with youâll wherever youâll go, thank youâ. Then he stepped down and every one applauded (one reason may be because he gave a short speech).                 The music began again and it was a fast number so all of my friends along with the boys got into a circle and began dancing. The dancing was CRAZY, after a while everyone began leaving the dance floor to get some rest; we left the dance floor to get some drinks. After some rest the D.J stopped the music, âKylie Rodriguez, this song is dedicated for you from Alisha, Petronella, Cindy, Amelia, Ian, Calvin, Mike and your best friend of all- James, its called âFriends Foreverââ. It was a slow number and James came closer to me and whispered in my ear âWanna dance?â                âSureâ I replied still wonder struck, then I turned around towards my friends and they were all smiling at me suddenly I couldnât see them anymore because my eyes were probably gleaming with tears both mixed with happiness and sadness. The song was simply beautiful; the chorus went some what like this         As we go on, weâll remember all good times we had together        And as our lives change, come whatever        We will still be Friends Forever.                   âIâm going to miss youâ James said looking me in the eye âYouâll probably find really some good looking guyâ.                âJames, stop thatâ I retorted âYou know I wonât do that, and besides donât you trust me?â                âI donât want you to goâ he replied âI know weâre young and as the adults say itâs just puppy love but I donât think itâs just puppy love, itâs real love and I can feel it perfectly wellâ he paused for a moment and then went on âI love you Kylieâ. I couldnât resist crying I couldnât believe this was happening to me.                 Finally when the party ended mum drove me back home, most of the way it was silent then I decided to break the silence âMumâ I began âIsnât there any way I could go to the same school as my friends?â                âI know itâs hard Kylie but eventually you will have to leave your friends and trust me in no time youâll make new friendsâ she replied.                âBut Iâm going to miss them, I just canât itâs too difficultâ I replied.                âI know dollâ mum replied âBut donât worry, it will be betterâ.        âWhy exactly am I going to this school mum?â                 âBecause itâs a school thatâs perfect for youâ                We arrived home and ha dinner, with that I went to bed. Thatâs it I thought as I was lying in bed; no more Canley Heights Primary School, and I still didnât know why I was being sent to Canterbury High.   The Holidays went by rather quickly, it was the last weekend.                The next morning was a Saturday and I slept in, I only woke up with the sun shinning directly in my face. I had a wash and went to have breakfast, just as I began the phone rang âIâll get itâ Jessica said and made her move towards the phone. âLet it go on the answering machine Jessâ Dad said. Dad doesnât like us to do stuff when it comes to meal time. âOkayâ she replied and sat down again. The phone rang a couple of times more and the answering machine started âHello, no one is available to take your call, please leave your message after the beepâ Beep!! The phone went and then a familiar voice started âHey Kylie, Alisha here, I guess your still sleeping anyways give me a call when you wake up, catch ya later byeâ.   During that little message I looked at dad wondering if heâll allow me to answer it then, he just glared at me and went back to his meal.                After our breakfast, Jessica and I done the dishes and I got to the phone, I dialled Alishaâs number and Stephanie (Alishaâs elder sister) answered âHelloâ she said.                âUm... Steph?   I asked.                âYeah, Kylieâ she said immediately recognising my voice âHold on a sec, Iâll get Alisha for youâ then she kept the receiver down but I could still hear her shout out âAlisha, phone call for youâ.                After a while Alisha answered âHello Kylieâ she began âgot my message?â                âYes I didâ I replied âwhatâs wrong?â                âOh!! Nothingâ she replied âI was just wondering how youâre feelingâ.                âThanks, but I think Iâm okayâ I replied.                âOkayâ she replied âI was wondering if youâd be able to come over to my place tonightâ.                âTonightâ I asked âWhatâs happening?â                âOh!! Iâm just having a sleepover, just us girlsâ she answered.                âSleep overâ I said âCool, but I have to ask mumâ.                We chatted for a few more minutes and then I went over to mum and asked her, she said okay, then as I was getting ready Jessica came to my room âKylie, where are you off to?â she asked. âJust for a sleepover at Alishaâs houseâ I replied. âOh!!â she said âgreat, have funâ.                âJessâ I said âI really wish I could take you butâ¦â                âThatâs okayâ she said âI have my books and I have the tele.â.                âListenâ I began âCan we do something fun next weekend, you know after going to a dumb school it will be funâ.                âSureâ she said brightening up a bit âIt will be fun, but I wish I had friends though, and then it would be funâ.                âCome here Jessâ I said and gave   her a little squeeze âI   know how it feels not to have friends because Iâm going to miss all of them when I leave but just try to talk more act friendlier and most of all loose that frown of yours and show off that beautiful smile you haveâ.                âDo you really think someone will want to be my friend?â she asked looking so pitiable.                âSure they willâ I answered âJust be yourself, itâll work outâ.                âThanks, Kylieâ she replied âIâm glad youâre my friendâ and then she went out of my room looking a bit better.                That evening mum drove me over to Alishaâs place, I was dressed in my pyjamas which had teddy bears all over it, I rang the door bell and Alisha answered it âHello, come on inâ she said opening the door wider. âThanksâ I said admiring her pyjama suit; it had little red hearts all over it         It looked beautiful; when I went inside I saw everyone else there âHey you guysâ I said.                âHelloâ everyone chorused and I knew that something was going on âWhatâs going on?â I asked.                âNothingâ Amelia said, âNothing reallyâ Petronella backed her up. âOkay, if you guys say soâ I said.                âLetâs go up to my roomâ Alisha said âwe can pick out the videos to watch tonightâ. The others and I went upstairs with our sleeping bags slung across our shoulders. Then as soon as I entered Alishaâs room âTa daâ all for of them shouted out together, when I looked around Alishaâs room it was filled with stickers and posters which said âKylie, youâre the best and weâre still your friends and you rockâ. âThanks you guysâ I said âYouâll do have to do all this I mean...â. âYeah, whateverâ Cindy said. âAs if you donât appreciate itâ Petronella said. âDonât make a big fuss over thisâ Amelia put in. âLook what I haveâ Alisha said holding a video camera in her hand âSay hello everyoneâ she continued âIâm taping this outâ. âAlishaâ I shouted âHow can we possibly be ourselves when weâre being taped out the whole timeâ.                 âWhy not?â she asked âIâm just going to keep this down   here and letâs party, that way weâll have our last primary school party on tapeâ.                âOkayâ I gave in âBut can you just put that thing down and come and join usâ.                âMemories dear childâ Alisha said in a sarcastic tone âWeâll have lots of memoriesâ. We cracked up at this joke and began our party, there was tons of food to eat and we played lots of games but I think we chatted a lot most of all and I had lots of fun. âIâm really going to miss youâllâ I said. âCâmon Kylie, itâs going to be just the same, the only difference is that you wonât be in the same schoolâ Cindy said. âYeah, itâs not like weâre going to discard you or anythingâ Amelia said. âYes, remember weâre going to be friends for ever and everâ Petronella said. âOkay, now stop getting mushy all of youâ Alisha said knowing that we were on the verge of crying âTen years from now weâre going look at his video and laugh at ourselvesâ. âI forgot weâre on videoâ I said. Petronella looked directly into the camera and said âIf anyone besides the five of us sees this video ten years later may be our kids or something, this is what we were when we were leaving primary schoolâ   the rest of us just giggled.                 After a while we settled down to watch a movie- The Titanic the most romantic movie Iâve seen. Then we watched Cheaper By The Dozen a comedy movie, which was fun. It was around four in the morning that we were sleepy and went to bed after a pillow fight. We woke up at    twelve noon    and we were still sleepy, we heard footsteps and then Mrs.Graham knocked on the door âGirls time to wake upâ she said in her rather shrill voice. âNot now mumâ Alisha called back âitâs our last day to sleep inâ. âOkay girls just another half hour, because Kylie and Petronella your folks will be here soon to pick youâll up and Cindy, Kylieâs mum will be picking you up, so hurry upâ. After that we couldnât go back to sleep, we were just rolling around âGirlsâ I said in a rather lethargic tone âThanks a lot for all thisâ.                âThatâs no problemâ Alisha said, âYeah no problem at allâ Cindy said, âI hope we do this more oftenâ Petronella said. âNot always at Alishaâs place, itâs not fair that wayâ Amelia put in âWe should have sleepovers at each otherâs places as wellâ. âSure we shouldâ I responded âIâll just love to have you guys over because youâll are just greatâ.                We had our brunch (which was breakfast and lunch together), at the table Alisha said âSo, Kylie are you ready for school tomorrow?â âYes, I guess soâ I replied âI may be ready with all the stuff like books, but not ready to face the kids and the new school thereâ. âAre you scared?â Stephanie asked as she entered the room. It may look as if Stephanie is a bit nosey but we like her to join in sometimes in conversations. âA little bitâ I replied then I thought for a moment âOkay a lotâ I admitted. âOh!! Poor thingâ she said sympathizing âIt must be hard for youâ. âWell itâs like weâre starting kindergarten againâ Alisha said âWeâre going to be the youngest againâ. âYes, I know itâs hard, but look on the bright side there will be more hot guys to perve on, high school guys are hot!!â Stephanie said âWait a minute not just hot they are cute andâ¦â âYes Steph but we already have boyfriendsâ Petronella said. âOh!! Yeah, but trust me youâll will find tons of other guys when youâll go to high schoolâ.                 That made me think of James again âWhat about these guys, weâve been going out since foreverâ I put in âSurely weâre not going to just dump themâ. âLook, I donât mean that, that will definitely happen, Iâm saying that sort of thing mostly happensâ she replied. âWell, if that sort of thing happensâ I started âI donât think it willâ. âAll the best thoughâ Steph said as she was walking out âAnd remember just be yourselves when youâll go to High Schoolâ. âThanksâ all of said.                Later mum came over and picked up Cindy and myself. I went home and started getting ready for school next day. I kept praying that the day should go by slowly but it didnât, it just glided by quickly.                 The next morning I got up, had my shower and since I didnât get the uniform as yet, I took out my black long sleeved turtle neck top and a pair of jeans, then I combed my hair back and held it up with a clip, I put on a little bit of blush, a tint of lip gloss and I was all ready.                 Since it was my first day mum said sheâll come along with me. âHave fun Kylieâ Jessica called as I was getting ready to leave. âThanks, you tooâ I replied hurrying up. I canât believe the holidays went by so quickly, but thank God it all ended up with a party at Alishaâs place. I was all ready to leave and so was mum, we got in to the car and it was a 45 minute drive. When we arrived there, mum jumped out and we went to the front office. Let me describe the school first, the walls were all covered in blue and yellow paint (it didnât look very welcoming). There were kids all over the place, at one end I saw a girl and a boy making out, wait a minute I canât   call these people kids, theyâre people. âHelloâ mum said when we reached the office; the walls there were covered with year photos. A plump lady was there and smiled at us as mum was speaking âHelloâ she replied âWhat can I do to help you?â âUmâ¦ this is my daughter Kylie and sheâs new to this school, all the form details were already filled up the other dayâ my mum replied. âKylie, Kylieâ the woman replied as she was going through a few papers âHere we go, Kylie Rodriguez, Youâre here to join Year 7â then she looked at me and smiled. âYesâ I replied in a very small voice. âHere you go loveâ she said handing me a piece of green paper âThis is your timetable; I hope you find your way around here, the classes are all labelled so I donât think youâll get lostâ.   âThanksâ I replied. âIf youâre going to join in today, thereâs no use in family waiting with youâ she said. âNo, I just came to drop her offâ mum replied âIâll be heading off to work hon.â                   Mum gave me a kiss goodbye âDonât worry doll, youâll be alright, Iâll come and pick you up at three okayâ she said and gave me a hug.   After mum left I felt like crying I was nervous, I felt as if I was starting kindergarten again. The place looked so big and frightful.                 The bell rang and I looked at my time table it said 7M3 (Maths) A9. A9!! I didnât even know which block I was in, how am I supposed to find my class, just then I saw a teacher and I went up to her âExcuse meâ I started âI canât seem to find my class, can you please help me?â   âSureâ she said then looking at my time table she told me to go straight and then upstairs and that I would find my class upstairs. I thanked her and thanked   God that Iâd   found my class. I entered my class room and I looked around, there was not a familiar face to be seen, every one was sitting with someone. There was a spare seat right up the front and I had no other go but to sit there.                   I could not concentrate on anything in class and during lunch I had to sit all alone, it was like hell. When mum came to pick me up I tried my best to act as if school was so great but on the whole speak I was so angry with her for not letting me choose the school I wanted. I couldnât wait to come back home and as soon as I arrived home I went straight to my room and lay down and cried and cried, till I could cry no more. I stopped crying when someone knocked on my door âWho is it?â I asked wiping my face. âKylie, itâs meâ Jessica said âThereâs a phone call for youâ. âCome inâ I answered, after she handed me our cordless phone I thanked her and answered the phone âHelloâ I said âKylieâ Cindy squeaked âHow are you?â she asked. âIâm goodâ I said trying to sound as cheerful as possible. âThatâs goodâ she said âWe had the best day at high school; we had problems finding our classes, but guess what?â âWhat?â I asked still feeling so sad and miserable. âWe have to move around every period but weâre all in the same class, isnât that great?â she said. âThatâs really coolâ I replied and at that moment I started crying. âKylie?â   Cindy asked âAre you okay?â âIâm fineâ I replied still crying, then I felt something a feeling, is Cindy doing this just to make me jealous, how could she? âCindyâ I almost shouted âI know you had a great day and everything, but you donât have to make me jealousâ. âKylie, I thought youâd be happy for meâ Cindy said âI didnât mean to maâ¦â. âYeah!! Whateverâ I cut her short and I slammed the phone down. At that very moment I wished I never even said that, after all I shouldâve been happy for my friends, not jealous. Since it was the first day we didnât get any home work.                 While we were having dinner, dad and mum kept asking me stuff about school and I tried my best to tell them that I had the perfect first day. After dinner I went to bed. The next day I got up with the intention of making new friends and to try and be more social.                âHelloâ I said to a girl who was sitting next to me during my math class. She looked really pretty with her dark eyes and brown hair âHi!!â she said. This is it I thought, the beginning of a new friendship, a little while later another girl came and looked at me, looked right into my eyes which made me scared, this girl was skinny and tall with blue eyes âExcuse meâ she started â But I think youâre sitting in my placeâ. âWell, I didnâtâ¦.â and I stopped because she started speaking again âI donât want to know what the explanation is, just get your butt off the seat and moveâ she said in a really unkind tone. I looked at the girl who was beside me and she looked back and mouthed âMoveâ. I was surprised, what was wrong with these people here. I just gave both of them a weird look and moved to the front row and sat down there.                 The whole day I tried to make more friends, I tried to talk more but some how I couldnât find any one to be my friend. That week past by rather quickly, at the end of the week as Alisha and everyone else planned went out together. We went down to a new fast food place near my house. Of course the boys were there too. James greeted me with a tight hug âHelloâ he said as soon as I arrived âSorry about not calling you before, I was umâ¦ umâ¦â âBusyâ I helped him out, I was a bit mad at him though for not calling me. âIâm really sorry Kylieâ he said. âThatâs coolâ I replied âAfter all weâre in high school nowâ. âI missed you a lot Kylie, how was high school for you?â he said. I just let out a sarcastic laugh âSchool, was just perfect, except the fact that I hadnât made any friends at all in school and I miss youâll like crazyâ   I replied. âSorry to hear thatâ he said with a sympathetic look in his eyes âI didnât mean to make you feel sorryâ. âI knowâ I said âI canât believe that I miss youâll so muchâ.                âDid you find yourself a new girlfriend?â I asked sarcastically. âYeah heaps of themâ he replied âHow about you? Did you find a nice new boyfriend for yourself?â âNot reallyâ I replied.                 That day went off perfectly, I apologised to my pals and they gave me the confidence that theyâll always be there for me and Iâm glad. The only thing left for me to do was make more friends. The sleep over went off brilliantly too.                 It was Monday morning and I got dressed for school and I caught the bus. As soon as I entered I saw one of my class mates there, seeing that there was a chance for me to make a conversation I went close to her and asked cautiously âIs this seat taken?â âNo not reallyâ she said looking at me directly and a smile appeared when I sat down next to her âThanksâ I replied. âThatâs okayâ she said.                 We travelled for a while and then she asked me âWho do you hang around with at school?â âUmâ¦â I began wondering what reply to give her, should I tell her that I have not yet made friends, how can I tell her the truth then after a few seconds I replied âNo one really, I have no friends at school because Iâm newâ. âOhâ she said with a funny look in her eyes, she hesitated to say something then she finally spoke clearly âYou can hang around with my friends and myself at schoolâ.                I felt so much better that someone had asked me to join their group. âThanksâ I said âAre you sure youâre friends wonât mind?â I asked again. âIâm not a 100% sure, but I can always askâ she replied casually. âCoolâ I said and we kept chatting about all sort of stuff, I told her how I hated to leave my friends and join this new school and she told me how she had a brother and a baby sister. It felt so nice to have someone to talk to and I was glad.                School went on as usual and I met all the other girls, there was Kimberly who seemed to be the boss of the group and there was Helen, Amanda, Lena and there were a few guys around, one of them looked so elegant and smart and so charming but very quickly I corrected myself and told my self that James was there. To be precise school went on perfectly that week and when I told my parents and Jessica about how Iâm enjoying school they were so happy. Jessica and I hung around more often together. We spent so much time together, we went to the movies, to the mall and this time I actually enjoyed myself.                 At school, I made lots of other friends and it was just perfect.                âHello youâ I heard a familiar voice when I picked up the phone. It was after school and I rushed home as soon as I could because I wanted to go on the internet fast so I could chat to my friends online but as soon as I came I heard the phone ring. âJames?â I asked. He laughed a little âwant to come down to my place to watch a video because Iâm babysitting Emily and since this is the first time Iâm babysitting, a little help would be greatly appreciatedâ. âRight now?â I asked hoping heâd say no. âYeahâ he said âBut if you...â he started off again. âIâll comeâ I said âItâll give us some time to chatâ.         âGreat, thanks Kylieâ        âThatâs k, Iâll be right overâ.                I had a quick shower, wrote a not to mum         MUM, JUST GOING OUT TO JAMESâS, WILL BE BACK IN AN HOUR OR SO        KYLIE.                Then I told Jessica that Iâll be out and I headed off to Jamesâs. âHiâ he greeted me. âHiâ I replied. It really seemed like he was having a tough time with his little sister, he was carrying her and he looked completely tired. âLooks like your having a really tough time nowâ I said. âYeahâ he replied, just then Emily started crying. âMay I?â I asked James stretching out my hands out to carry Emily. âWith Pleasureâ he said.                 I actually got on very well with Emily, but I didnât t do anything extraordinary, I just did normal stuff (Baby stuff).   After a while Emily was napping and James and I were having a banana split that was readymade. âKylieâ James began and he had a serious expression on his face âYou knowâ¦ how you and I areâ¦ going out and stuff, I thinkâ¦we have to, you knowâ¦â I could see that he was trying hard to bring out the right words. âBreak up?â I helped him out.                 âYeahâ he said âitâs so hard like not to notice other girls at schoolâ he said.   I tried to manufacture a smile but I guess I didnât succeed. âKylie, youâre a really good friend and you are really the best girlfriend ever, but thatâs why I donât want to hurt your feelingsâ James said.                 âI knowâ I said âI face the same problem when Iâm at schoolâ.         âReallyâ?                   âYeahâ I replied âBut we still can be good friends, canât we?â                âOf courseâ he said âSo?â                âSo thatâs it thenâ I replied âMy first break up with my first boyfriendâ. After that I felt Goosebumps on my skin and my eyes become heavy with tears and before I could stop myself I started crying and the best thing was I didnât know why.                 âIâm sorry Kylie, I didnât mean to hurt youâ James said.                 âIts okayâ I replied wiping my eyes and trying to stop myself from crying âI didnât think Iâll take it so badlyâ.                 He leaned over and gave me a hug, I looked up at him and he managed a small smile   âI better get goingâ I said âItâs getting lateâ.                 âOkayâ he said âIâm sorry about thatâ¦. Its just that I donât want to cause you to get hurtâ.                âI understandâ I replied âsorry if I made such a great deal out of itâ.                âThanks for helping me out with Emilyâ James said.                 âThatâs okayâ.                I put on my jumper and went out doors. It was a bit chill out side or may be it was only me feeling chill. âKylieâ I heard a voice, I turned around it was James âYeahâ I said.                 âFriends Forever?â he asked.                âNoâ I replied âFriends now and foreverâ.                He smiled and I smiled back.                         I went back to my house and into my bed room. I took up a book and started reading. Someone knocked on my door.         âCome inâ                âHai Kylieâ Jessica said coming in.                âHi, how was school?â I asked.                âGood and you? She asked.                 âExcellentâ I replied.                âReally?â she asked âBecause you look really sadâ.                âDo I?â I asked âThereâs nothing really wrongâ.                âIf you donât want to tell me thatâs fine, Kylieâ She said.                âOkay Iâll tell you after all youâre my sisterâ I said âI just broke up with Jamesâ.                âAw! Iâm sorryâ Jessica said âHow come?â                âItâs because now that weâre in high school things become so different, there are plenty of other girls and boys that weâd prefer someone elseâ I said.                âBut arenât you sad?â Jessica asked.                âA bit, yesâ I replied âbut every thing happens for a reasonâ.                âKylie?â Jessica asked âYou know the time we spent together?â                âYeahâ                âI had the best time of my lifeâ she said .                âIâm glad to hear that Jessâ I said âThatâs really good, and we can do more stuff together later â.                She came over and gave me a hug, I hardly ever hug my sister and this was something unusual. Jessica probably did have the best time of her life.         âKylie, thereâs a phone call for youâ I could hear mum call. âComminâ I shouted back. I ran down as fast as I could.                 âHey Kylieâ         I immediately recognised that voice; it was Angelaâs âAngela!!â   I said.                âHey Kylie, I got your e-mail just todayâ Angela said âLook Iâm sorry if your school isnât the best nowâ.                âNo Angelaâ I said âItâs just perfect now, Iâve made a few friends and itâs really great I love itâ.                âOh, thatâs great thenâ Angela said âIâm glad to hear that and I hope you make more friendsâ.                 âAngela, howâs Ken?â                 âHeâs alright, howâs James?â                âJames and I umâ¦ are not going out anymore, we broke upâ I said.                âIâm sorryâ Angela said.                âWell, donât beâ I said.                âWell arenât you feeling sad?â Angela asked.                âAt first I was, but he finds it difficult not to notice other girls and I guess thatâs a good enough reason, so that means we donât trust each other so much and trust is one of the basic necessities in a relationship and we donât have it soâ¦ well I guess thatâs itâ I said and then took a breath after speaking such a lot.                âYou speak as if youâre a grown up Kylieâ Angela said and she laughed.                I didnât know whether to laugh or not so I just said okay. I chatted to her for a while more and then I went up to bed.                I lay down and I looked up at the ceiling and thought to myself, âlife is so funny at times and when you have a problem it feels as if itâs the end of the world but when life goes on just fine just the way you want it you feel as if youâre on the TOP OF THE WORLDâ and that was just the way I was feeling at that moment- ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD.                The End                                                                                         High School is something that the girls always looked forward to but it isnât what Kylie actually wanted. Itâs time to move on and get into high school and Kylieâs parents want her to go to a different school from her friends.   She absolutely hates the very thought of it. She tries to explain to her parents that she cannot leave her friends or her boyfriend-James. She tries to explain things to her cousin-Angela but right now she feels that everyone is against her and everyone hates her but above all she gets jealous of Jessica- her sister. Jessica has always been so brilliant and clever and is good at ever so many things. Kylieâs world is turning upside down but when is everything going to come back to normal or will it ever come back to normal?   Will everything change when our five friends go to High School or will they still remain Friends Forever And Ever?

               Once there was a little girl named Claire, she had everything she wanted in life, good home, good friends, and good education. But she always seemed to be discontented with herself. She was a girl of 13 with straight jet black hair, black eyes, lovely features but she always seemed to be complaining about her looks. Her parents and elders kept telling her that she looked fine but she never seemed happy like for instance just because she saw someone on TV with blonde hair, she wanted blonde hair.             One day as she was passing by a shop on her way home, from school, she was having a conversation with her friend Elizabeth " How I wish I had blue eyes instead of black eyes, at least then I would be beautifulâ just then a busker (a person who entertains people on the street) who was playing a violin spoke out in a firm yet kind voice " At least you have eyes to see the world, never mind the colour ". When she turned towards this man she saw he was blind. Till today she is discontented with herself but at least now she tries to be contented with herself and every time she thinks of putting herself down or criticizing her self a picture of that poor man flashes in front of her.
