       Yes, last night Mikey and I went to watch the premiere of Harold  at the Mann's Chinese Theater. It was awesome. That was a great way to spend our anniversary day. Yeah, but what was awesome was just the time we spent together at Hollywood Highland and the Kodak Theater. IT WAS JUST AMAZING. There was so much life there.. All the lights were darling. I had the greatest time last night even though it wasn't much.  On the way home, we had those meatDOGS.. MMM yum. You know, the ones that could kill you.  I had a dream last night too.. Very sad. It's about me not dancing and how much I missed it. The dream was me not dancing anymore. Umm, something about me never being on the drill team again. I cried so hard in the dream.. not me physically but in my dream I know that I was being torn by the one thing I love to do.  Oh well, yeah.. maybe it's the second thing i love to do ;p  More about today though.. Mikey came to visit.  We walked to JOann's.  WE WERE TIRED!  We shopped at joanns, I took a dump im KMART.  We bought tons of fabric and that was our day.  The walking.. wooo the walking was so much.  Justine came over to play with my sister.    I won't be able to attend Storm's 6th bday tomorrow. I'll be seeing eric though.

      This is it.  This is finally it.  I think I will now be able to attain money weekly or bi-weekly.  I will not allow myself to jinx me, so I will be going now.

       It's not literally a bad START. I'm just saying.. I was thinking there would be a great start.. with a clean slate off my shoulder. My mom was shortly arriving with my sister and grandmother, then my dad decided to start a fight and blame it all on me as well as everything else that goes wrong in the house. It's okay. I don't mind. I got pissed off and went alone to the LAX airport. Actually, I brought my brother with me. We both got in trouble when we were found in the terminal by my dad. OH WELL.   So alrelady it was a bad start. Umm, then we didn't talk all night and now he's not home. It's already almost 11PM tonight. I guess he's more mad than I am. The house is a mess again because of all the things we have to sort outsince my mom bought a ton in the philippines. We got a lot of things over there, well my mom did. And now I got a lot of things ;D   I don't really know how to say. When I don't know what to say, I sound lame.
