      Look into my eyes - you will see What you mean to me Search your heart - search your soul And when you finally there you will search no more Donât tell me itâs not worth tryinâ for You canât tell me itâs not worth dyinâ for You know itâs true Everything I do - I do it for you  Look intomy heart - you will find Thereâs nothinâ there to hide Take me as I am - take my life I would give it all I would sacrifice Donât tell me itâs not worth fightinâ for I canât help it thereâs nothinâI want more Ya know itâs true Everything I do - I do it for you  Thereâs no love - like you love And no other - could give more love Thereâs nowhere - unless youâre there All the time - all the way Donât tell me itâs not worth tryinâ for I canât help it thereâs nothinâ I want more I would fight for you - Iâd lie for you Walk the wire for you - Ya Iâd die for you  Ya know itâs true Everything I do - I do it for you   -- Bryan Adams

        I am feeling betrayed, cheated and ..... I dont know why its hard to stop feeling the pain of rejection...why do people ever fall in love? This just sucks...i was just not made for all this..I think its crap and u know what i am not going to cry over it! Its just a waste of my life and time to think over someone who happens to be a total "jerk" (dont know really that is the right word,but works for now). What do u do when someone doesnt feel the same about u? I thought it was a two way thing.... I know I think too hard, and this just drives me nuts....commitment is something I will never be able to do....esp to someone!!! Although as much as i love my independence I hate this lonely, emptiness feeling inside me...does this happen to you ever? or am I just thinking too much? I know this just doenst make sense at all....but right now my head is just not in the right place...i think i need to call it quits! arrggghhhhh.....

       Hello everyone,        Welcome to my blogspot! Well believe it or not, i signed up for this thing 2-3 times but never was an active user. I would create the account, come to it after a few weeks, sometimes months (no no not years yet!..god hope not) and realize that i have forgotten my username and password. So well i would create a new account....and can you make a wild guess as to what might have happened again...hahaha...well i need not say it...yes exactly that! Well today I made sure I would put this page up and become an active user...no matter what...so I ask God to give me that strenght....hehehe! Nah just kidding...I am for real this time....I am going to become an active user....and post something on it! So everyone out there who is reading this please wish me luck! Thanks in advance ;)    Aighty then, just feel free to post any comments or nething you think is of interest....Chao for now!
