      âWâ go home  Written by: Carolyn Hileman    It started that cold wet day in 2000, the comments, the harassment and the hatred. It continued even on September 11th when anchor men and women were attempting to blame that tragedy on you even before the ashes cooled. They never saw what we in Texas saw in you, they never tried, instead they used the fact that you were from here as a detractor. They laugh at the way you talk, call you a cowboy, funny thing is back here in Texas that is considered a term of endearment. To be a cowboy is the finest thing you could be here where you make it only by true grit and a true love of the country.    They do not deserve to have you lead them; they have turned the Presidency into a big joke. Those people are actuarially proud of what your predecessor did while in that office. They hold him up as if he is something to emulate, even though the most memorable thing he ever did in the White House was disgrace it. They know nothing of true leadership, they donât want to know. They do not deserve a man who walked back into a target to lead his people; they deserve a man like John Kerry who was one of those who ran that day, let them have him. Come home to Texas and become the president of Texas, that is right I am suggesting that we break away from the Union.      For a while now I have been thinking there must be a place where those of us who hold conservative values can live without the liberals breathing down our necks and telling us what they deem to be our rights. The fact is Texas is exactly the place I have been thinking of. Letâs be honest here, we need absolutely nothing from the other states. As a matter of fact we send electricity and satellite signals to those states. There is really no reason to be involved with those other states at all. We grow our own food, hunt, fish, have plenty of oil, so what exactly do need from the rest of the United States that hasnât been united since our Forefathers past away.    Their idea of unity is do it our way and we wonât sue you, they donât even know how to read the constitution but can sit around and tell us how many so-called rights they have. Someone should tell them that no where in the bill of rights does it say that you have the right to kill an innocent baby. There is no right to get married, there is no such thing as separation of Church and state. They call us ignorant, at least we can read the constitution and Bill of Rights; we know what is in there and what isnât and we donât go around pretending that what ever we want is a right simply because it says we have the right to happiness.    I say we give the liberals thirty days notice that we are about to become our own country and that they are no longer welcome here. Let the other Southern states, which would like to join us in our endeavor, become their own country and we will only transact with them alone. Let those Northern folks run the rest the way they like, let them have their Gay marriages, abortions and churches that are politically correct. We can bring the military to the South because the liberals donât believe in guns; we can even promise them that we will not use our arms or military to protect them in deference to their stance on gun control.    So yes, âWâ go home and lead a country who knows what true leadership is, leave those yellow bellied sapsuckers back in Washington. Come home and make Texas the greatest free country in the world, let them keep their UN, let them lick Franceâs boot straps. Let them go beg the UN and Nato to protect them, let them deal with all those terrorist countries. We all know they will not touch Texas or anyone in the South because we donât roll over and play dead. You hurt us and we will hunt you down and you will know what pain is, we donât go for that politically correct war stuff we take care of our down here. So let them have their personal version of Hell and come back home. Weâll keep the lights on for ya.

      Hollywood  Written by: Carolyn Hileman    I grew up listening to Jack and Dianne and hurts so good, however it isnât hurting so good anymore. I was so proud when my children embraced the music I grew up with, John Cougar, Bon Jovie and others. I always believed in my soul that they wrote about my life and truly understood the common American person. Boy was I so wrong!!!! They have no clue about me or what I believe in, They are nothing more than a couple of punks who have to run with the crowd to look bigâ¦    Now Jack and Dianne are resting in peace in the trash, I guess I just out grew them; after all it is my life. Living on a prayer was my theme song for the longest right up till I figured out that Bon Jovie probably never uttered on in their life. You know I let those guys off the last time, I had decided that I could listen to the old songs but not buy any of the new stuff. But now it turns my stomach to accidentally hear one of their songs.    I told my children that it was classic rock, but I am beginning to think the only Rock singers or groups I can listen to will be dead that way they cannot disappoint me. As for the Hollywood stars, I suppose I will resort to watching reruns, not of anyone who is alive though. These clones really drive me nuts, they do not have an original idea of their own. Do you know what they remind me of? You all remember the clicks in school? You had to dress the same, talk the same, walk the same and you were not allowed to have a thought of your own, because if you did you would figure out you didnât want to belong in that click anyway.      Well I just am not about to sell my soul so I can watch their trash and I refuse to absentmindedly sing to the songs I used to. I can fill my music shelf with Charlie Daniels, Gretchen Wilson, Darrel Worley and Toby Keith. They sing about the heart of America. I can pass my hours watching classics like Gone with the wind, and John Wayne, they fit the redneck in me anyway, I would rather eat oleâ messy Bar b q than dine with any of that Hollywood bunch any day. And I would darn sure rather sit and watch the sun go down in my back yard than any movie by Chevy Chase, sorry fella I never found you that funny any way.    Now if my abandoning Hollywood means that I am no longer cool, oh well. I will still watch some shows till their stars start acting like the rest of us are stupid. I guess these geniusesâs have yet to figure out you make me mad and you ainât getting my moneyâ¦ I donât mind you having an opinion but when you decide your opinion is more important than mine that is when I turn you off. So go right on ahead and act like jerks you are just saving me a lot of money and time. I donât need you to be happy, I can be just as happy going to a friendâs house and talking about absolutely nothing all night.    Go right on ahead and give Moore another Academy award I donât care I havenât watched that junk in years. Tout that fool as something special when everyone knows that if Bush was really like Hitler like he said that fat boy would be filming behind bars if he were alive to do it. I do find it amazing the stuff they pass off as talent these days, they have to have a script to know how to act that is why they cannot figure out how to behave when they are not in front of a camera. All I have to say is that as my Dad always said, if we could by them for what they are worth and sell them for what they thought they were worth we could all be rich.    You know Bugs Bunny, Taz and Porky havenât been to any fundraisers I think I might start watching them, Thatâs all folks.
