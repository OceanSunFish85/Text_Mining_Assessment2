      I didn't go to sleep until 5 o' clock this morning. I don't know why, but I just wasn't all that tired. Staying up that late did prove to be semi-productive. I e-mailed some people that I haven't talked to in a while. I even wrote some song lyrics.They're not all that great, but it was how I felt at the time. When I finally did go to sleep, it was wonderfully blissful. I only got 5 hours of sleep, but what sleep I did get was absolutely wonderful. My mom is beginning to think that I have insomnia...I'm not so sure I disagree anymore. The earliest I've gone to bed since Thursday was 3:30 AM. Oh well...if I'm an insomniac, then I'm an insomniac. I'd be the reason that the drug companies discovered sleep aids. Then again, I've had a lot on my mind lately, so that might be why I haven't been sleeping all that well lately. Update on yesterday's posting: My "sister" is off the respirator and she'll be out of intensive care (hopefully) tomorrow. Maybe now that I won't be so worried about her, I'll get some more sleep tonight...maybe, maybe not. Who knows?

      Don't get me wrong, I love my life and I know it's nowhere near as difficult as most people...It just feels like my life is falling apart at the seams and crashing down into a pile of rubble. My best friend and I got into a huge fight the other day and now we're not speaking. The person I love the most is clueless to how I feel. I would tell him, but every time I open up to a guy and tell him how I feel, he runs off in a blind panic due to fear of myself. I've been told that holding one's love inside can make you physically sick...I'm starting to agree. One of my awesome buds is moving fourteen hours away. His father is suffering from terminal cancer...it's a lot better than where it started off at, but he's not "out of the woods" just yet. Lastly, my "sister" had open heart surgery at the age of fourteen. I'm so scared that something will go wrong and that I will lose her...I don't know what I would do without her. There's so many other little things that are happening, but those are the main things. I wish that just one of these things would go away. I wish that my best friend and I would resolve our issues, that I would muster up the courage to tell that special someone how I really feel, that my bud's father's cancer would go away, and that my "sister" gets out of the hospital soI can quit losing sleep over her condition. Frankly, at this point I wish that I lived in the middle of nowhere with as little human contact as possible. Life would be so much easier that way.
