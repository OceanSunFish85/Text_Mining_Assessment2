       As most of you know, my cat was taken to the Humane Society last Monday--July 12 before I went out of town to Gulf Shores. I thought it was taken care of.....I mean, I didn't like the idea of taking it there, but I really had no other Humane way of taking care of it. Afterall, that is why the Human Society exists.   Anyway, I am going to bed Sunday night and I get a phone call at about 9:30 and it is my neighbors' daughter in law who also happens to be on the board of directors at the Humane Society. She calls me and begins cussing me and harrassing me about putting my cat to sleep. She is upset and basically, I said "mam' I don't have to take this!" and I hung up the phone. I was so upset. NO ONE has ever spoken to me like that before. She was out of control. I finally think it is over. I go about my business.  Then, Monday morning, she calls again this time blocking her number so I don't know who it is. She continues to pound me and ask for info because she is trying to track down this cat. I told her that I would have been happy to have given her that information the night before if she had spoken to me like an adult. Then, I call to see if she left a message on my answering machine and she says, " I like the 'God Bless.'(with sarcasm) You put your cat down last week. Nice Going." I am soooo upset. She has no right calling me up and harassing me about using something for the purpose it was intended.   Is this what board members do to all who drop animals at the shelter, or does she just think she can pick on me because she thinks I am a young person who won't do anything about it? Is this how a board member should represent an organization that they are a part of? If you feel so strongly about something, you shouldn't be a part of something that goes against your values. She was out of control and overstepped her bounds.   For you all that know me, I'm not one to complain at a restuarant, for service or anything like that. I am usually the one to grant the benefit of the doubt, but I am going to complain to the chairman of the board of directors and let them listen to my answering machine message. This was not a professional conduct. It's just a cat, people!!!!!

      Well, today I tried something new--nothing extreme, but a little extreme for me. Today, the Daily News was having lots of free stuff around town. I was at church when some of the guys mentioned going. They asked me to come along, but I've never golfed before in my life.  I have never even tried a driving range. So I went with the intention to just drive the golf cart around. But, when we got to thePaul Walker Golf Course it just looked like too much fun. What did I have to lose......it was FREE!! Johnathon let me borrow his extra set of clubs. (They did have to teach me how to carry the bag.) I looked very official at the tee off of the first hole, except that I didn't tee off there. I skipped the first hole because I didn't want to get kicked off the course. I didn't do too bad. It was so much fun. I still lost, but I was comic relief. I only had problems with the being quiet part. I know you could never imagine that since I am such a quiet person all the time. Anyway, I hope to go again really soon.

       I just got back from the beach.....I am so tired. I can't wait to get into my own queen size bed--not to mention my comfortable bed. But I am too hot to sleep at the moment since my A/C has been off all week. Let me tell you a few things that I learned this week at the beach.  1.) Ineed to realise that some personalities just don't get along well together. I just spent a week at the beach with three other friends: one other girl (thank goodness) and two boys. There are definate A and B personalities and they can't always appreciateeach other'sdifferences. I was determined to have a great time at the beach and I did, but it was definately interesting. I knew going into the week that it could be that way. It just isn'tcool when you find out what pushes someone's buttons and gets them worked up and then continue to do it. Especially when you have a 9 hour car ride together. If you dish it out, then you better be willing to take it. It just stinks when you are the "peacemaker" type and want to know why we can't just all get along.  2.) Kites are so easyto fly on the beach. Just be careful because it might not be tied at the end. Then it will fly off and be eaten by the sea oats that you can't go into. Those signs are everywhere.  3.) If you've seen one souvineir shop, you've seen them all.  4.) There are some great places to eat in Gulf Shores. EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SEAFOOD--like me. If you go there, be sure to check out Bayside Grill.  5.) Books are better when read by the beach. Just take them in before it rains.    Those are some things that I learned on my trip to the beach. I might think of some more at some point after I get some sleep. But for now, that's it.

      Funny, how God throws little surprises your way to build your character.    You know the last few days, I have had a certain old friend on my mind.  This old friend and I even dated at one time.  It was not a good relationship, but it was better to say I had a boyfriend--even if we never were together than to be single and alone.  It was the whole idea that technically, I wasn't single.  At that point in my life, I found my completeness in a relationship.  Somewhere down the line, circumstances changed and we broke up.  That was sort of a turning point in my life.  I saw that only Christ was going to help me be content--I have to find my contentment in Him.    Anyway, since then both of our lives have changed.  I graduated to "old"(you know when you can't stay up past 10:30  that's only because of the news.)  He has entered into two totally different phases of life.  He has been married and he has a child.  He has been through a lot.    Here's how it started.  The other day I was just going about my business.  I was hanging out with my nieces and newphews and this old friend/boyfriend called.  I was so shocked.  He wanted to go to dinner, but now it was not that easy.  He has to arrange for a babysitter, etc.  Well, I don't make plans during the July 4th weekend because we were going to do dinner.  He couldn't get his parents to keep his son, so we end up cancelling.  He said he would call me again.    I immediately had 2 reactions.....1.)Anger/resentment  All these feelings I had from the relationship before all came back.  I thought to myself that some things will never change.  I knew he did this on purpose.  2.)disappointment/pity    I really wanted to go to dinner and hang out and at least get another shot at a good friendship.  There really aren't many people that I ever thought were mad at me.  This was one relationship that I never had closure to.  It makes it awkward when I see him.  Anyway, I thought and thought about it.  Then the more I thought about it, the more it mad me angry.  He would never call me back--he just wanted to go out and use me or hurt me.  Then, the next week,....  I was reading my Sunday School lesson for the next week in Ephesians 4.  It was talking about how I should be humble and gentle.  Be patient with each other, making allowances for each other's fault because of your love.  Verse 15 talks about becoming more and more like Christ.  Verse 26 talks about not letting anger overcome you to cause you to sin.  It goes on to say, be encouragement to those who hear your words.  All of this stuff was me....I was not living the life worthy of the calling.  The last two verses say, "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of malicious behavior.  Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.    Wow, talk about something hard to swallow....I was so upset over this whole situation and didn't even know the whole story or anything.  God called me to take action, but I really didn't know how to go about it.  Although I don't know the whole situation and I may never.  God has called me to forgiveness.  No matter whether we ever do dinner or not, God loves him and shows him mercy.  I am called to show that same mercy.  I can't even imagine being in his shoes right now.    So, if you are reading this and you know I am talking about you, I would first of all ask your forgiveness for all the years that I have had this anger towards you.  I thought it was gone, but it just surfaced again last week.  However, I would be willing to do dinner and to start over as friends.  And that is all I want.  I want to be a friend that you can count on to help get you through this whole situation.  I don't know what your intentions were when you called for dinner.....I'm sure that it wasn't to use me or hurt me.  It actually helped me come to grips with some stuff.  So even if you don't call me, I am a better person because of Life's Little Surprise last week.
