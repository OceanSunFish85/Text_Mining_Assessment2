      Ok, so I still canÂ´t make my blog look as I want it to look, but iÂ´ll keep it updated the same.  So this are my works in progres:   NÂ° 1:    urlLink     This is how my Sophie is going.  I figured that if everyone else was doing one, I must have my own! ItÂ´s the first time I work with circular needles. Here we donÂ´t have those! And if we do, we only use them for finishing collars or so.    NÂ° 2:    urlLink    OK, this is a terrible picture, but I hope the sweater doesnÂ´t turn out so bad.  This a merino sweater wich needs a lace finishing once IÂ´m done with the sleeves (halfway done).   NÂ° 3:    urlLink    IÂ´m  proud of this one. This are my new pillow covers. I must make five of these. One is done and seamed already   NÂ° 4:    urlLink    This is the most boring scarf I have ever started.  ItÂ´s a 1x1 pattern.  I hate it, but it was a request from dad.  I think IÂ´ll finish it for next winter (june 2005, here).   NÂ° 5:    urlLink    This is my GraceÂ´s back.  ItÂ´s made of synthetic angora.  You wouldnÂ´t believe the softness of this yarn... IÂ´m knitting it along with  urlLink Lisa  Yeah! I have just put her link! This is a whole new discovery for me...  IÂ´m exhausted now. ThatÂ´s all

      IÂ´ve been knitting for a year now, but I discovered the internet knitting sites only a month ago. For quite a long time IÂ´ve been reading other peopleÂ´s knitting blogs... First I had to learn what a blog was... Then I found out there were lots of girls that shared my passion all around the world... And at last I became an addict to knitting blogs too! So I decided it was about time I started my own knitting blog. The only problem is that I canÂ´t write a perfect English, and I know nothing about blogs! So IÂ´ll do my best, please be patient!  Now itÂ´s time to introduce myself and my beautiful boyfriend, Charly.   urlLink     This is us. ArenÂ´t we the cuter couple in the world? At least in Argentina we are!
