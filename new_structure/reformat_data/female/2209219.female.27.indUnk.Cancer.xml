      Time to get your crayons and your pencils!  Pictures of me! (Because everyone wants to look at me, right?)  I have a Yahoo Phot album that I update from time to time.  Just check out my member pofile. (nikknap)  urlLink http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/88c1de83/bc/Yahoo!+Photo+Album/e4ff.jpg?pftZcZABvzCE5Ruo   I've been obsessing over my weight again.  I really want to lose 15 more pounds.  Anyone with a good, healthy idea on how to do this is encouraged to fill me in.  I'm determined to exercise and get myself into swimming suit condition.  It's been so friggin long since I felt comfortable in a suit.  Part of the problem is the general flabby, mark-upped condition of my skin after giving birth to all those babies   and  getting so fat after I had Ayden.  I'm starting my first day at the Super 8.  Woo-Hoo.  I'm also meeting someone tonight who may work out to be a roommate.  Here goes!  Oh, and another poem for Trast  Untitled  Opinion ate ed- ible pears  because he didn't want to eat  dead animals and he thought dead barley had feelings, too.   (Line breaks provided by me.  I have no idea what he's talking about, here.  We had a discussion on opinions and opinionated people.  He brought up vegatarians.  I told him about vegans.  This was the result.)

      Post away, lads and lassies.  The lovely Sarah has joined (see below) and I am looking forward to hearing her thoughts.  She always has great movies and books to talk about.  She also thinks she's cynical, but has enough love in her to make the world she encompasses a bit better.    As for Mr. MacDougall, he'll probably never post because he doesn't love me enough to care.  Waaa.  Sob.  Boo-friggin'-Hoo.

      Hey, how's it goin'?  I have not heard from you for some time and was plesantly surprised to see that you are going to be blogging again.  I miss you and I have a few new movies and a book to recommend.  Movies:  "Gia" ( I think I already told you this one)  starring Angelina Jolie as real life super model from the early 80's.  She is beautiful and so sexy in this role.  The movie gripped me and was the start of a new obsession that I have with Gia.  "Party Monster" This one stars Macauley Culkin and Seth Green as NYC club kids.  It is based on the real life of super club kid Michael Ailing.  I love the story of his life, the stars are not actors that I like too much, but they did an ok job. I think that Michael Ailing will be another new obsession for me.   "Caturing the Friedmanns" This is a documentary about a family whose life was ripped apart by a child pornography scandal in 1988.  It was during the "boom" of child porn when police would arrest almost anyone without a shred of proof.  Were they guilty?  You decide, I have my doubts.  Fucked up family, yes, but guilty of all charges?  You be the judge.  The most interesting thing is that this movie started out as a documentary on NYC "career clowns", yes, people who actually make a living as clowns.  It turns out that the oldest Friedmann boy is a party clown, and during interviews for the clown documentary, his family history came out, and thus, the clown flick was scrapped and "Capturing the Friedmanns" was born.  "Heavenly Creatures" starring Kate Winslet.  I know, the chick from Titanic, it was enough to almost maker me not watch.  I wanted to see this b/c it was one of Peter Jackson's (of LOTR fame) first movies.  It is the true story of two New Zealand schoolgirls and the lengths that they will go to in order to be together.  Very disturbing.  Christopher saw the opening scenes, fell asleep and awoke for the ending scenes.  He was wondering what the hell I was watching.  After you see this, and take note of the first and last scenes, you will see  why he was a little confused.  I believe that it is pretty apparent that I have been on a true story kick recently. One last movie that was great is  "Rabbit-proof fence" about the fence that goes from one end of Austrailia to the other. This is the story of some incredible youngsters and what they endured just to be home.  If you see this on DVD, be sure to watch the making of.  It is just as good as the movie. The great book is "The joy of funerals" by Alix Strauss. It is short stories that seperate at first, but then woven together with the last story.  All the stories have elements of death and are so beautifully written you will want for more. One piece of good news here, my friends, Jody and Kevin, just found out that the book they co-wrote about a couple coping with breast cancer is being published.  Amazon picked it up and first edition will be in early May, 3,000 copies!  Yea for them!  :) I love you and miss you Nikol, hope you see the movies and read the book!

      How the hell do I explain to these children why the following is funny?;  Knock Knock Who's there? Cantalope Cantalope who? Cantalope, I'm already married.  I wasted a good 45 minutes trying to enlighten them on the subject of knock knock jokes.  It resulted in;  Knock Knock Who's there? Ayden Ayden who? Ayden CANTALOPE!  I remember when I tried to talk to Trast on the subject of "Why did the chicken cross the road?" and all other jokes along the same vein.  His response? Trast: Why did the chicken cross the road?  Because it wanted to die. Me: Why would it want to die? Trast: Why would it be by the road? Me: A chicken sure would have to be sad to want to die. Trast:  It's a chicken, mom.  Can I have a popsickle?

      I really want to open my own cafe.  It'll have ambiance, great food, fantastic coffee and tea and art art art!  The problem is I'm flat broke.  But why let that stop me?  I suggest that all sorts of rich people invest.  I've been thinking a lot about Milwaukee's upcoming mayoral election.  Why do I care?  It isn't as if I live there.  Kwabana, Muhib, Tiffani and DJ Vale have a way of reaching people, though.  They're all about Marvin Pratt.  I'd have to say that I agree with them there.  (Sorry, Dave)  Barret seems a bit too focused on building business in an area that already has an established business district.  I see this as doing nothing at all for the more depressed areas of the city.  When people think Milwaukee they usually picture a small, "nice" area and then a larger, industrial, hide your wallet and lock your car doors when you drive through area.  I think Pratt is more focused on changing that conception by bettering those neighborhoods.  I'm sure he has enough sense to see that one way to do that is to establish more jobs in those areas.  After all, he's the one that helped Mecca become what it is.   Trast's poem for the day:  Butt Towels  I like to poo Don't you? Never argue with the data your butt sends Never argue with your butt don't pretend that you do not have to go poop and make sure that the bathroom is  ready for you because it sucks when all the butt towels are gone.

      Okay, so my last blog was pretty spotty when it came to regular posts on my part.  It was crazy that people really read the last one.  It only encouraged me.  But, hey, I have things to say.  So, what is up in this 25 year old woman's life?  I live alone.  Yuck I think I found a job. The divorce in in progress. My kids are cute and cool. I am reading "Franny and Zooey" which was lent to me by David Jackson. I have an attractive, funny, intelligent, geeky poet boy.  He's cool.  He has a site that everyone should check out, especially if they need to hire a top notch programmer and pay him tons of money so he can get a new car. www.alanmacdougall.com I have great friends who will be montioned all over this blog.  Now, I'll do my little happy daily entry.

      I deserve a raise.  Last night at work we had a false fire alarm.  Munish had never dealt with that before and he had no idea how to get it turned off.  Not only was it loud and panic inducing for the "guests", but there was an inspector there giving the place a rating.  I also have never dealt with farm alarms, but I used my quick wit to asses the situation and made the horrible noise end!  Hooray!  I'm learning a bit about marketing.  I will make this job worth my time!

      In other, relevant news, I have another theory about the goings on of this wiley world we live in.  If any of you have been abreast of current events, you'll have seen and heard countless news stories about the movie "Passion of the Christ".  I'm not talking urban legend tripe.  I mean, actual news items in regards to the actions of people after seeing this flick.  There seem to be two schools of drastic response.  This is not saying that all people who have seen the movie have had these responses.  (I dunno, I haven't met or spoken with a single person who has seen it.  I don't want to go to it alone, or I'd give my first hand account.)  The first reaction seems to be one of anger.  Fights have broken out over this movie, and I'm not talking little fights.  I'm talking knife, gun, baseball bat and scissor involving fights.  The people involved in these fights are not just trailer dwelling, on Cops 5 times last week for domestic violence, always getting into trouble sort of people.  So, what gives?  What is making these people think it would be a good idea to shove scissors through hands?  The second reaction is one of repentance.  These are the people who robbed banks and committed murders that see this movie and turn themselves in.  You'd think it would be good enough to just ask the Lord for forgiveness and hope for your spot at Heaven's all you can eat buffet.  Nope, these cats are going straight to the police.  They're going to do time over something they already got away with.  I have to wonder about the stuff that doesn't make the news.  Dolores sees the movie and confesses to Jim that she's the one who ate his chicken sandwich from the employee fridge 2 years ago.  It could be happening, people.  "So, Nikol," you ask me, (you know you want to ask me), "what do you think is up with this movie?"  I'm glad you asked.  If you didn't, you should've, you lousy, no-goodkin.  I'm sad to have ever called you a friend! Get out of my blog! BWaaaaaaaargh!  Theory One (The Box Office Buy-out)  Mel Gibson has tons of money. (No, that isn't the theory, you dink.)  He could easily use his resources to buy these news stories.  Let me stress here that this is     not  about  URBAN LEGENDS  or their creation.  All you have to do in that case is start a rumor that you're sure others will pass on.  In most cases, these legends all get debunked rather quickly.  What I'm talking about is producing the news.  Perhaps I bought into "Wag the Dog" a bit too much, but this is different and even more possible than producing a war.  So, I'm thinking Mel's people (mind if I call him Mel?) have been using the news as their greatest form of advertisement.  Theory Two (Armageddon Here, I'll have a Large Popcorn, Extra Butter)  Perhaps these things are really happening!  If they are, we need to truly examine why this piece of gory entertainment is having this effect on people.  We all knew that it was going to be a movie about Jesus getting flogged and tortured.  We all knew that there was about to be some string of theological debate.  We all knew that some kook was going to say this it is our social responsibility to ban/watch this movie.  It would be a shame to turn a blind eye to this reaction as if we saw it coming.  So God and Satan are duking it out right now (and me without pay-per-view) by testing the strength of their followers.  Those on Beelzebub's team are moved to stabbing.  Those working for Yawe are confessing.  Or is it the other way around?  Who am I to say?  If you take a look around at the other thing that are going on right now, you'll see what I mean.  Janet Jackson was bleeped for saying "Jesus!" on David Letterman.  Everywhere you go you are bombarded by Christian Leaflets about the movie.  There was a little basket of them at a Subway last night that even invited me to go to a four part lecture series at a church discussing this movie.    A woman just began a trial for killing two of her children and seriously injuring a third because God asked her to.  This deserves it's own paragraph because taken alone, it's just another of those "religious crack pot" stories.  I find it interesting because she woke her kids one by one in the middle of the night and took them out to the yard.  She asked them each in turn to lay their heads on a large rock while she stood over them with a big, heavy stone in her hands and bashed their skulls in.  These were not babies.  (The baby is the only one who survived)  These children were 6 and 8 years old.  They knew mum was going to kill them.  They had to know.  They let her!  And I think the worst part is (Yeah, worse in my mind) the opening statement of her lawyer.  It was something to the effects of, "Should this woman listen to what she thinks to be right, or should she turn her back on God?"  Those are just examples of the craziness that is happening all over the world.  I could list for hours.  I think you'd prefer I didn't.  What's you opinion?  Oh, and just to be clear with everyone... I'm mostly joking.  You know, creative writing.

      At first I thought Nader was looking rather rough.  I saw him on the television box at work.  I only got a small glimpse, though.  Munish was trying to show me what channel HBO was in case people called the front desk to ask.  I saw this man UP CLOSE not even 4 years ago.  Ayden, Mitch, Trast and I went to a Nader rally.  I made a sign with Nader's head on a Kermit the Frog body that said, "It's so easy being green".  Personally, I voted for Harry Brown, but I wanted to hear Michael Moore and Nader speak.  Nader looked like your average older man.  He's kind of ugly, but physically he seemed to be holding his own.  I'd go so far as to say he looked good.  If any of you have seen recent footage or pictures of Nader, you'll know that dude is looking haggard and only vaguely like himself.  It's terrible.  His entire face is gaunt, but sagging!  His nose looks like it's about to drop right off of his face.    The first (and obvious) thought I had was that perhaps aliens sucked the life out of him and are using his body.  The second is that the GOP got to him first.  They killed and zombified him and are using him to do their bidding.  Hey, it could be the Democrats.  What do we   really  know about Kerry?  Could he have evil powers?  Is Nader going to burst into the song, "I've Got No Strings" at his next appearance?  Then it dawned on me!  Perhaps the  real  Nader is bound and gagged somewhere, maybe dead, maybe only barely hanging on to his life.  Perhaps some darker enemy is masquerading as Nader.  Look at the photos, I beg you!  Could this man be Sadaam?  You have to admit, there is some resemblance.  I am gathering evidence!  Check back here regularly.  I'll send a sign to all of those with me once I am ready to confront this poor look a like.  If I disappear suddenly, you all know that I was right!

      Below is an articel that was written about a presentation that the Wasteland Poets did at  Catholic High School in Wheaton, IL.  I'm a bit resentful at the mention of myslef as a "former beauty queen".  Why do people drag this shit out to focus on?  But I had a good laugh at the stuff I was quoted as saying.      Poetic license   Wasteland Poets provide St. Francis with new understanding of genre   By Tim Waldorf staff writer    Wasteland poet Dale Ritterbusch, a creative writing and literature professor at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, stood in an auditorium half-filled with hand-selected St. Francis High School students March 9, and he encouraged them to sing with him as he recited "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts" during a portion of the school's Poetry Jam '04.   Ritterbusch said he had tried this once while giving a poetry presentation to his daughter's elementary school class, but his daughter's teacher disapproved.   "What she was suggesting, really, was that there was a proper language and subject manner for poetry," Ritterbusch told the students, "and greasy, grimy gopher guts was not it."   Obviously, Ritterbusch disagreed, and he didn't hesitate to tell the group why. He said so many people are tied to "this conservative understanding of what poetry should be." Changing that understanding was the goal of the Wasteland Poets â a group of accomplished Wisconsin poets featuring Ritterbusch, "gypsy wanderer" Liz Hammond, "gutsy single mom" Anjie Greene-Martin, and "former beauty queen" turned artist Nikol Knapmiller.   "Poetry at every level is not taught quite as well as it should be," Ritterbusch said. "And, by they way, those traditional (poetry) anthologies are boring at the college level, too."   Many are filled with perfectly fine poetry, he said, but poetry that doesn't deserve the kind of exaltation that it receives anymore. The language used and the subjects addressed just don't impact readers these days, he said.   "Poetry is supposed to have some impact on the reader, and if it doesn't do that, it really isn't poetry," he said.   "It better evoke some kind of response from your readers other than putting them to sleep," he later added.   The group recited some of its work as examples, and then provided the students with writing challenges as they broke into small groups to compose a poem or two of their open before an open mike segment.   Earlier in the jam, so many students read poems they had written about how some didn't really know them. Knapmiller challenged the students to flip that around, explore themselves, and write about what people do know about them.   Greene-Martin asked students about a person in their life in a poem starting with the phrase "I remember," and Hammond encourage students to write an eavesdropping poem â one in which the first line was an overheard comment. Ritterbusch requested that they simply write about the most recent argument they had with their parents â a popular theme among the poets.   "It seems like every poet up here has an angry mom poem," Knapmiller said. "You don't have to be mad at your mom to be a poet. It just helps."   James Wall, a creative writing professor at St. Francis, organized the jam â an invitation-only event in which he selected upperclassmen from his courses. English teachers also recommended freshmen and sophomores they thought could gain from the experience. More than 100 took part in the event.   "And they're not all A students, either," he said. "I was looking for students with a creative spark. Students who could gain from the experience."   While poetry is always studied in school, poetry writing, he said, is sometimes put on the back shelf in favor of more traditional college preparatory practices â like the famed five-paragraph essay. But the five-paragraph essay doesn't nurture creativity quite like poetry does, he said.   "And the idea of creativity is just so darned important," Wall said.   While his students' efforts primarily focus on such themes as the high school social scene and the pleasures of growing up in suburbia, Wall said they will grow into better poets if they persevere.   "They have to live," he said. "They have to go out and get lives."   For now, though, Wall is working with them to create an anthology for the school. Set for distribution in April, the anthology will include 60 poems and one short story, and it will be titled "The Righters."   "Because they create stuff that makes society right," Wall said.

      No more weight dropping for now.  Until I can get a healthier, more accurate image of my size I will conentrate (not obsess) on getting in good physical shape.  This may mean that I will have to eat more calories per day.  Good thing I love avacados.  Those babies pack a whompin' 360 calories per fruit.  I started at the Super 8 and it's okay.  I have a habit of focusing on any place a work to try and make it the best damn place to work ever.  I've laready let Munish in on a few decorating ideas that I have.  Next I'm going to work on making the Continental Breakfast a bit better.  I met Sourabh.  I suppose he  may  still be roommate potential.  We had a good time until things got a little haywire, but we talked it through.  The problems I can see arising are  a.) I need time to myself.  He doesn't seem to want to accept that.  (He stayed the night and was there well into the next afternoon.)  I tried to get my alone time in there and he wouldn't leave me alone.  We talked and talked and talked and talked until my jaw hurt from all the talking.  I've determined that small talk is good at times.  I don't mind having deep conversations with people, but I'd like to limit their duration and instill a policy of "No Existentialism Before Breakfast".  b.) He likes me.  I mean he    likes me .  If I passed him the 2nd grade note, he'd circle YES three times and highlight it.  It's good to like your roommate.  It isn't good to want a relationship from them.  That only leads to trouble.    So, there it is.  G'day all.

      The first day of pain is here.  I don't know how to cope with this.  I can't go ten minutes without blubbering wildly.  I'll spare you all the details and just say that I have no fucking clue how to make this work out, nor do I own the oomph it takes to do it.  For the moment I am feeling fatalistic and morbidly depressed.  If I have any friends out there who aren't sick of my bullshit melodrama, now would be a great time to step into the light.  I'm grasping here, folks.  Life is not good.    I really wish someone were around to take care of me.  I need to be taken care of right now.  If I weren't such a lousy person, perhaps I'd have a plethera of options in that field.  I did this shit to myself.    The world is not going to become a better place.  I'm so deep in the darkness that I was listening to "My Immortal" and staged in my head as a song sung to myself.   Fuck fuck fuck.  I am one stressed out lady. S. O. S.

      My kids are hilarious.  Here's a mental image that I'm hoping will make you all smile:  We put in the Chicago soundtrack and jumped around the living room singing and dancing.  Ayden played Billy pretty well as he sang, "All I Care About is Love".  Trast and I had a go about who got to play Roxi.  I finally gave in and let him, but on the condition that I got to play Velma and Momma.  It was fun.  They got a real rise out of me singing, "There's a lotta favors I'm prepared to do.  You do one for momma, she'll do one for you." Then Trast dug out the blonde wig for his rendition of "Funny Honey".  All three of us danced wildly to "Both Reached for The Gun."  I'm so glad I spawned such hammy boys.

       urlLink Wow, I wish I were fun   Seriously, though, I think I'm okay today.  Well, Pratt didn't win.  Too bad, really.  History could've been made.  Milwaukee does need to pump up it's interracial image.  If all of those people who were unsure would've looked past any of the dirt Barret's people dug up, things may have ended differently.  There's dirt to be had on anyone.  'Cept Jeebus.  I'm not expressing any hate for Barret, though.  He'll do more of the same old for Milwaukee, I'm sure.  He also has a decent stache.  I'm still gathering photos of Ralph.  Please send any odd news articles my way!  Look expressly for articles in which Ralph says things such as, "I am just a shell" or any of the following words/phrases: aliens ovipositor no more recycling destroy the earth vote Republican my skin is slipping off  Yipee!  I just got a lot of CD's in the mail.  "Chicago" soundtrack Ella Fitzgerald "The Ballads Adam Ant "Wonderful" DJ RAP "Learning Curve" Sonic Youth "A Thousand Leaves" Marcy Playground Simpsons "The Yellow Album" Blues Explosion "Mo' Width" LARD "Pure Chewing Satisfaction" Primus "Frizzle Fry" The Reverend Horton Heat "It's Martini Time" Mr Bungle "California" Mike Patton "Adult Themes for Voice" Oingo Boingo "Boingo Alive" Pixies "Come on Pilgrim"  Tons of listening enjoyment!

      If anyone can tell me how they manage to do it, I'd be ever so grateful.  (and fat)  It just isn't right for cookies to be that soft and tastey.  Speaking of tasty, the Korean food was delicious.  On the menu almost everything climed to have been cooked in a tasty sauce.  I chuckled over that until I put in in my mouth.  I'm so glad to have a boy like Alan.  You know, for tons of reasons.  In this case I mean because he can take the same delight in really good food.  I've still been dreaming of bunnies.  Evil bunnies suck.  Last night I had a brown rabbit cross my path.  Then the thing just sat and stared at me.  It wanted to come after me like my ankle was made of carrots.  I'm sure of it.  Twitchy beast.

      She took a tiny nap, woke up feeling much better, and we went to a Korean restaurant. They had some really good kimchee made from radishes, spinach, sprouts, and potatoes as well as the traditional cabbage; and the proprietress showed us how to eat our moderately-exotic food. (The bul-go-ki is Atkins-friendly by default: you wrap the meat in lettuce, dab on some soy paste, and chow down.)  Too bad about the poetry, though.

      At least this isn't that post where I'm all chipper.  I have to admit that if I wanted to restore my faith in poetry, Thai Joe's was not the place to do it.  God, it drove me mad to the point that on the ride home I ripped a stack of my poems in half.  I don't regret it.  I'm very sad today.  I guess I am feeling kind of alone.  Very sleepy, too.  Matter of fact, I do believe I'll take a tiny nap before going home.  Loving people is not all it's made out to be.  And in the words of Amy Rae,  "Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters."

      I had yet another interview today with HQ Global.  They sure do love interviewing me.    I am not going to say a word of regret about the last post.  I still feel all of that.  The positive thing is that I do not always feel like dung.  Most of the time I am quite happy with the world because I have family and friends that understand me.  When they don't understand me, they love me anyway.

          There was an infestation of college aged lacrosse players at the Super 8 last night.  Scary.  BOYS!  I am proud of myself for resisting flirt temptation.  (Okay, I did flirt a little, but I didn't take up any invites.)  Not that Alan would have cared.  I hate that.  Why can't I have one of those uber jealous boys who punches holes in the wall and casts glowering looks at any man who comes near me?  Yeah.  That'd be zesty.  Really, it would just make me feel like less of a bitch for all of my jealousy.    I have another interview tomorrow.  I'm so very tired of interviews.  I want to just go in there and say, "Listen, I'm going to be the best damn thing that's going to happen to your company.  You won't know that until you hire me, though.  That's all I have to say.  Call me or don't call me.  Whatever you do, don't send me a form letter.  It wastes paper."  And what is with people who don't leave messages?  What the hell is the point of having voice mail if people aren't going to use it?  Instead I get random numbers on my caller i.d. and no idea why they are calling.  Pisses me right off, it does.  I think I'm going to give up on my writing for good.  I was reading some of my poems and realized how self-indulgent poetry is.  I HATE POETRY.  You heard me.  I abhor it.  I no longer want to stand in front of a group of people who are pretending to listen.  I no longer want to sit and force myself to smile and clap when I hear something that I know is crap.  True, the good stuff gets me excited.  I love it when a person finds a way to say something in a fresh, new way.  I'm just weary of the fucking flora and fauna bullshit.   Wow.  I'm just going to go to my room and not come out until I have something nice to say.

      I had a really good time last night.  The reading was amazing.  I still prefer an atmosphere like Rising Tides where it feels a bit more intimate.  Lyrical Sanctuary had rows of chairs lined up and lots of lighting on the mic area.  That always makes me feel shaky.  I had to read off of a piece of paper that I had ripped in two.  I threw a bit of a tantrum last week and ripped a huge stack of poetry up.  Yes, I'm melodramatic.  Thalia is really cool.  She's tall and pretty and talented and intelligent,  She sang a little bit of a song she wrote.  It gave me chills.  She's damn good.

      This is a post just for you, Steve.  You're creeping me out with your cute little antics.  I hate the word "stalker", but man!  You better take a good look at your behavior and get a fucking grip!  Maybe you need a support group.  I hate to be a bitch, but when I'm good at something, I stick with it.  So, here goes...  STOP looking at my on-line profile which gave you the link to this very blog.   STOP looking at this blog. STOP looking at me in on-line personal ads. STOP reading Alan's log. STOP referring to Alan at all. STOP wishing harm upon me or anyone I'm close to. STOP looking my name up in various on-line search engines that give you personal information about me. STOP sending me pathetic, "I love you" instant messages.  I long ago removed you from my buddy list.  Take my lead. STOP acting like I murdered your puppy because I don't want your creepy hands on me. STOP STOP STOP  Don't make me hate you, okay?  Until recently I just felt kind of bad for you.  While we worked together I couldn't stand it.  Each shift with you was about as bearable as Barney singing friendly songs to me as I'm getting a root canal.  So I quit, Steve.  I quit so I'd never have to look at your pathetic face again.  I quit so I didn't have to deal with your anger.  I quit so I didn't have to feel your hands reaching towards me to caress me innocently when I was having a bad day.  I quit so I'd never have to be cornered in the cooler by you again.  I'd sure appreciate it if you'd drop your stricken, "Poor boy in love with an evil woman" act and never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever think of me or contact me again.  Crystal clear, buddy?  Good.   Now, do you see that little X up in the right hand corner, or are the tears clouding your wittle eyes too much?  All you need to do now is click on that and I promise you, everything will be just fine.  I'd hug you, but--- nah.  I wouldn't hug you at all. See, I'm damn good at being a bitch.

      I don't know why I called you guys stinky chickens.  I just did.  Forgive me.  I was just thinking about "Franny and Zooey".  I don't know why I had never read it before.  I really enjoyed Salinger's other stuff.  Well, I've read it now and I am not disappointed in the least.  I've been so depressed, you know.  So I start reading this book and in true Salinger style it features a character having a bit of a nervous breakdown.  At the point of discovering this I'm thinking that I maybe should stay away from this book for a bit.  You know, in the same way I decided to step away from the Plath.  Still, I was up.  It was late.  I needed to read something and my copy of "Feminism and Philosophy" wasn't quite cutting it.  I'm glad I finished it.  It would make a lovely one act play and it ends optimistically.  Sort of.  I mean, it gives you a reason to do things.  Granted, the reason is "...for the Fat Lady" and Zooey enlightens us that the Fat Lady is everyone.  It had an impact.  Read it, if you haven't.  Though I'm sure I'm one of the only people in the world with half a brain and two working eyes who hasn't.   So, the night progressed with more puking.  Plenty of that!  Trast continued to be a jerk about it.  Ayden just wanted some love, but Trast kept saying, "Stay away!  You'll puke on me."  He even refused to give Ayden a drink of his water because Ayden might puke in it.  Grrr.  So I got puked on instead.  I don't know that I'm a very intelligent woman at times.  You know, when my reaction to my kid puking in the hallway is to hold out my hands to catch it.  Or how about when I know that when he says, "Mom!  My belly hurts!  Please hold me." it means that as soon as I pick him up I'm going to have a stinky mess of my hands.  (Literally)

      Wow.  I managed almost six years of never gettting vomitted on by my children.  In an effort to make up for lost time, Ayden decided it was a good idea to coat me in a lovely pea-green color this afternoon.  I thought it was odd when he just decided to lay down on the couch and sleep, but he's been goign through a growth spurt.  Then he woke up and said, "I'm too tired to walk to the bathroom."  Five minutes later he started sobbing and said, "I'm laying down, but my belly still hurts!"  I had no sooner put him on my lap and given his back a tiny pat when the gush of terrible warm green was running all over me, Ayden and the couch.  Trast was no help as he held his dainty freckled nose and told Ayden to knock it off.  Hey, I'm so glad my kiddos are getting a public   urlLink education

      Hola.    So, I have a "date" (sorta) with a lovely person on Wednesday night.  I'm taking her to a poetry reading.  Chicks dig that sort of thing.  At least they better.  I've already told Alan not to cock block.  She's absolutely beautiful and her name is Thalia, but she goes by Thals.  She's not looking for a serious relationship (Thank GOD!) which leaves me optimistic.    Super 8 stuff is going well.  I start the marketing bit tomorrow.

      I want to go.  He says "stay". This is an excerpt from an e-mail he sent me once.  I said in an e-mail that I hoped he was enjoying the movie he was at...  &gt;The more I talk to you, the more special you become. You're a G-class star, soft and yellow, in a solar system where your children rest in that sweet spot, only a few million miles wide, in which life can thrive. If I'm lucky, I'm a comet, sweeping through once to shake off a tail of burning hydrogen ice and leave meteor sparkles in your corona; then it's off into the interstellar void for another fifty years. How can good acting and amazing special effects  compete for my adoration? &gt; &gt;But the orcish war elephants were pretty badass.  He's also a spelling and grammar nazi.

      When I put my time into something, I would like to make sure it lasts.  Pardon me for putting that in here.  Now urlLink laugh   Take a job, for instance.   If you go into it with the idea that you're only going to do it for a short time, you're more likely to muddle your way through.  It's easy to enjoy it while you have it because you know it'll be over soon.  It'll be a new experience.  No worries invloved. If you go into it thinking you'll be there for a longer time you're more likely to ensure you love it by expending lots of energy making it your own.  You worry about the things that go wrong, yet take great delight in the things that go well.  You find ways to get through the rough spots because it's worth it to you.  As for myself, I've lived a lot for my 25 years.  I can't say I'm especially wise.  In a lot of ways I'm just a kid.  But I have transcended the time when I can just live for the happiness of the moment with the idea that when things get unpleasant in any situation, it'll just be time to move on.  I'm looking for less hit points.  I'm looking for less experience points.  The only points I wish to increase right now are skill points.  However, I know that without the first two I mentioned, my skill points will stay the same.  I'm no longer afraid that I'm going to be alone forever.  Oddly enough, I now know that with all the people out there in the world, I'm bound to find a person who values me on a similar level that I value them.  As far as I'm concerned, I know someone who likes me a hell of a lot.  I feel the same.  We just need to iron out some of the wrinkles in our theories on life and love so that they can peacefully co-exist.   BUT  I also don't want to dump time into anything that just ends one day because it isn't good 90% of the time.  I'm more willing to go with the 70% mark.  I know enough about friendship and realtionships to see the reality in that.

      In King of Fighters '95, when your super meter is maxed, you get a variety of benefits; among them is the ability to "guard-cancel." It's easy to do: you take a hit, block it, and during your block-stun you simply execute the move. Instead of sitting through the rest of the block-stun, you instantly retaliate for a guaranteed hit.  This concept shortly began to appear in other games (and for all I know, KOF95 wasn't the first). In Street Fighter Alpha, you could "Alpha Counter," which guard-canceled into a knockdown. In King of Fighters 96 and on, you could guard-cancel into rolls or heavy attacks. SFA aside, the guard-cancel remains largely the province of the SNK side of the fenceâI could name a few non-SNK games that have it, but when you think of guard-cancels, you think King of Fighters.  If you're a middle-aged-school gamer (somewhere between Street Fighter Championship and Tekken II), you remember "Combo Breakers" from Killer Instinct. These, like most things about KI, were practically an unintentional parody of much better games: imagine suffering through a combo and thinking "make it stop! Dear God, make the pain end!" Well, Combo Breakers let you do that. Strictly for scrubs, you say? True; but then, KI's combos were strictly for scrubs in the first place.  Of course, the definition of the term "scrub" varies from skillset to skillset. Super hardcore SF3 fans will call you a scrub if you so much as jump, or fail to parry every hit of a shinkuu hadouken. Me, I call you a scrub if you mash more than you tap, and leave it at that. Nikol is a good poet, and she's cute. Note to Cyclops players: I include Mega Optic Blast in my anti-mashing stricture. Have you  really  seen it add more than a few pixels of damage? Is the lack of cool really worth it?

      Here's where I divulge some shit.  It's a nice day and my insides are feeling a little bit better, so I can handle this...  There is a reason I have to make dire situations funny.  There is a reason i like the most fucked up, depressing movies I can find.  There is a reason I enjoy listening to songs that make me cry.  All of this shit makes me urlLink happier  for some reason.  So, i've got these people thinking I'm morbid or pessemistic.  I was just told a minute ago that I hate everything.  That isn't true at all.  I'm an optimist and I love a lot of things.  I love a lot of people, too.    Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm about to say a thing or two that may seem trite.  I have no disillusions about how fucking annoying my moodiness can be, nor do I claim to be the most together person in the world.  I know I do and say things that are hard for my friends to deal with.  I obsess over my body.  I do things that aren't very good for me.  I have a tendency to be self-destructive at times and the rest of the time I have no regard for my safety.  I seem to seek out things and situations that could be harmful, or I at least don't avoid them.  I leave my curling iron on all the time even though it's a fire hazard, for example.  I say I smoke in hopes of dying from cancer at an early age.  It can be frustrating.  But, c'mon!  Cut me some slack.  I'm more together than I have a right to be.  I've pulled myself out of more messes than can be counted.  I have a reserve of strength for the times when I need it.  I was once told that I'm not strong enough all of the time.  Well, babies, that's shit.  I am super strong when I need to be and it saps me the rest of the time.  I think I'm well entitled to the moments when I have little break downs and can't get out of bed.  I need to let it out sometimes.  The fact that I'm not stark raving mad and locked away has to be enough at times.    I'm not about to go over every rotten thing that happened to me because there has been too much.  I know, I know.  I should just be happy that I have my health and there are plenty of people who are worse off than i am.  I've been hearing that plenty since I was a mere 5 years old.  I'm sick of hearing it.  I want a little allownace to say that I've seen more shit in my life than most people ever will.  It's hard for me to say it, but it is the truth.  So the next time I get weepy and sad for seemingly no reason, keep in mind that I may be strong, but I still have a lot to deal with.

      He was activated.  That means putting a plan together, then waiting to see if it happens.    Rising Tides was utterly fantastic last night!  It started out pretty small, but even with just a few of us we made some noise.  The poets were on, Joanne only did one song (phew), some new poets were there and the feature was Adaugo.  She is so amazing.  When Thals and I saw her at Lyrical Sanctuary I made it a point to introduce her.  I forgot that she said she'd be featuring at Rising Tides.  She did an awesome set, as usual.  After her set the energy was even higher than before.  A bunch of people showed up and blessed the mic.  Kwabana, Asterisk, Life and Pyramid did their thing.  Then Alan got up there and invoked something amazing.  He started singing just a silly little blues song.  It was funny.  But we kept it up.  One after one, people were getting up there and singing/speaking the blues.  Adaugo sang Billie Holiday style until she ran out of words.  Then she said she had the "been drinking vodka blues".  It all ended with Joshua the Scribe (what a great guy) getting up there to sing the "Happies" because he was just so damn happy he couldn't sing the blues.  I looked around and I saw that everyone in the room was feeling it, too.  We were one happy group.  Afterward everyone mingled and talked and hugged.  I don't mind when those people hug me.  I usually hate hugs.  They seem impersonal and pointless.  I think I'm going soft in my old age.

Again  Mitch is asked to volunteer to be activated with a sister batallion.  Again, Mitch says no deal.  Then the Sarge asks an odd question.  "Will you agree to be involuntarily mobilized for activation?" "Uh, no." yadayadayada "Any questions?" "Yes, sir.  What is the difference between volunteering and agreeing to be invoultarily activated?" "We've been asking ourselves the same question all day."   Hoo-AH   Gotta love the army.

      Hola, I'm posting this because Nikol made me.  She scared the shit out of me.  Her voice deepened and...um...um...that's all I could tell had happened 'cause we were on the phone, but I'm sure that alot more happened.... I don't think I've ever been more frightened of something so small since a swarm of daddy long legs attacked me while I was camping at Bong.  I'm over that though.  *twitch twitch*  I have good news for someone...anyone:  I have a 3-5 page paper due on the fight techniques (comparing and contrasting) of 2 or more films or plays of my choice.  You guys can feel free to submit examples (riiight...examples) of what my paper should include and how it should be formatted.  I think it would be best if you included everything except your name.  Well, that's all.  Have a good night!!

      Work work work!  I am too delicate for such tripe.  The status?  Subway is pretty cool.  I work with decent people.  They are fun and nice, but they also work really hard.  It seems that most of the employees there are good at their jobs and focus on work while there.  They joke around and have a good time, but they know how to do that as they work.  That means no one person is running around trying to do everything and getting pissed about it.  Also, I am not encountering any problems with being hired as a manager.  Everyone is happy with what they do there, so any questions I have get answered without eye rolling.  Oh, and they like me and tell me what a good job I am doing.  Nera, the owner, inserts things like, "I am so very glad you are here.  Now I know I don't have to worry about my store while I am not here."  Her husband also likes me and says he wants to make me feel happy there because I am a smart girl and hard worker.  As for Sub-Par 8, I need to insert an EEEEEEEK!  Holy shit.  I am getting a bit frustrated there.  I am constantly being given contradictory orders from the same damn people.  "Do all the laundry, no matter what."  Next day, "You did the last load as only half.  That will ruin the inside of the washing machine.  If there is half a load left, leave it there."  Next day I get there and get a note telling me to make sure I wash the cleaning rags.  Uh oh.  I see that there is only half a load of rags.  What to do?  Well, I'll just have to put half cleaning rags and half towels in to make a full load.  Next day, "You cannot wash rags with towels."  "But, there was only half a load of rags."  "You can do a half a load of rags.  It's okay."  Hmmmmm  Furthermore, I am not so happy about their business practices.  I don't think I can post here about  exactly  what I mean on that level.  I can relate a few stories.    One is that on Saturday night a couple came in for their room.  The computer had the charge of $89.00 listed.  I wrote it on their folio slip.  Then they pulled out a piece of paper where the price given to them on the Super 8 web site listed the room as $79.00.  I changed the price for them.  When I got into work on Sunday Munish was pissed.  I explained what happened.  He said, "All the area hotels were full on Saturday.  They couldn't have left.  You should have kept the ten dollars on there."  Grr.  That isn't right.  But then he tried to justify.  "You see, Nikol, for 6 months of the year we have almost no money at all coming in.  In the spring we start to get business again.  We need to make this business pay for all year long."  Okay.  Fine.  I will keep this in mind.    The phone rings.  It is a woman who wants to block 10 rooms for four nights in July.  One of those nights is pretty full, but I spend a good half an hour working magic and blocking those rooms for her.  I let her know she'll have to cancel a month in advance if she chooses not to stay with us.  I give her no quoted price because she doesn't ask for one.  I'm feeling pretty good about the lump of money I am making for my employer and this woman is happy.  She says she needs more rooms, so please call if anything else opens up.  More money!!!!  Munish returns from dinner with his family.  I tell him about the booking.  He is happy.  Then he looks at the woman's name.  A few minutes later he calls up to the desk and says, "You need to call this woman back and tell her we are full at that time."  Whaaaah?  "Those people stay here every year and they always want their senior discount."  Hmm.  So?  "We do not want them to stay here.  You need to call them now."  So I offer the solution that I call her back and tell her that the rooms are a solid $74.00 a night for all 10 rooms, all 4 nights of their stay due to the high traffic of that time period.  Not an option.  I had to call her back and cancel her reservations.  Maybe I shouldn't care, but for someone who is so concerned about retaining business and giving his Super 8 a new image, that's just shitty.  As for life beyond work...  The roommate search is still on.  I'm meeting a potential on May 7th.  It's another guy.  Guys are the only ones who respond to my stinkin on-line ad.  I'm not going to get my hopes up anymore.  He may just turn out to be another lonely creep who wants to touch my goodies. I have a reading coming up with the Wasteland Poets on May 1st in Waukesha.  It may be one of our most well attended, based on all the e-mails I've been getting from people I don't even remember.  They come across the site somehow and e-mail me.  Nifty, huh?  The poet Ramon (this 80 year old who recently responded to Alan by writing his own "rap") fell off a ladder and broke his hip.  That sucks because he and his wife lend an air to the readings that makes everyone feel good.  I'm looking forward to seeing Anjie and Dale.  I don't think Liz is going to be there.  I am working so much that I don't have much of a personal life right now.  Alan is doing temp work at Western States, so he can't come visit me.  Thalia is working through the next 10 days.  She may be able to get to the reading, though.  I hope she can.  I need to point out right here how exceptionally cool she is.  Not only is she beautiful, but she's incredibly funny, open and honest.  Sarah and I need to get together  soon .  She sent me an invite to her Stampin' Out party, but I am working that night.    On a final note, I saw someone today that I hadn't seen in a few years.  Chief Nubauer of the Palmyra PD.  I have detested that bastard for some time.  It was strange, though.  He's lost a good chunk of weight.  For some reason, seeing him so much thinner (the guy was a barge) made me feel like being nice to him.  I wonder what that was about.  I even told him that he looks great.  I doubt I'd say the same if he were taking me in again!  Okay, I think that's it.  I know, it was a lot to read.  I bet you skimmed.  Skimmer.

      I keep giving this guy a hard time.  Why is that?  I honestly think I'm going to catch him doing something wrong, or worse that I'm not going to catch him and one day he's just going to say, "Here's the woman I'm going to marry.  You and I can still do it, though."  I think it's time I am through with all that shit.  If he wanted another girl to keep, he'd just get rid of me.  And why would he want one?  I'm a good girl to have.  Yeah, we're going to be fine.

      Ayden Story __________ When presented with questions intended to calm him down before bed, the three year old gets awfully Zen.  So, Ayden, what is the sound of one hand clapping?  Ayden picks up your hand so that it is alone in a clapping postion.  Then he claps his own hands over yours.  That is it.  That is the sound of one hand clapping.  Is this the silliness of a child?  He didn't laugh about it.  It was his serious answer to a serious question.  People need eachother and can accomplish seemingly impossible feats by working together.  Now clean the puke off of your chin.  I promise that I'll never be this sappy again.

      I recently sent out an e-mail to a bunch of people telling them about my new job and asking in jest for creative ways to quit my other jobs.  I'm sorry to report that my friends are obviously a bunch of dullards with exception of a slim few.  I got countless advice to just give the standard notice and be truthful about my reason for leaving.  Yeah, thanks.  I think you folks misunderstood the assignment.  I know how to professionals quit and that's how I did it.  I just wanted funny ideas on how to quit.  Two funny suggestions were made and I will here note them as well as their sources.  Pale is a very good friend of mine and has been since 1997.  We both lived in Carbondale at the time and he hosted an open mic that was a huge part of my college life.  He now lives in Chicago and is very happily shacked up with Eric, who he calls his "Splenda Daddy".  He works at a pet store and isn't totally thrilled about it.  He said that I should set up a meeting with my boss in said boss's office.  I should take a laxative about half an hour before the meeting, then march into the office, place the following week's schedule on the desk, climb up there and take a big shit on the schedule.  Thanks, Pale!  You're really good at this sort of thing.  I alerted the pet store to avoid any meetings you call with them.  John is someone who I will be meeting up with soon as a potential roomy.  It seems promising thus far as he understands that the room is for rent, not me.  We're e-mailing back and forth in order to get to know one another.  His suggestion was that I tell Super 8 and Subway that I need to quit in order to continue my work of making an ass impression on my couch.  So, there they are.  To the rest of you, tsk tsk!  You claim to be such a creative bunch!  Any other ideas are welcome, either by e-mail or directly posting here.

      I'm reading this great book and wanted to share a bit I found lovely.   "See, that's what I just told you a minute ago, Zayde.  You don't need no big reasons to love a woman.  The size of the love has nothing to do with the size of the reason.  Sometimes one word she says is enough.  Sometimes only the line of the hip, like a poppy stem.  And sometimes it's the way her lips look when she says "seven" or "thirteen".  Once I even said to her, 'Judith, how much is three and four?' just to see the seven on her mouth.  And sometimes, listen Zayde, sometimes jut the eyebrows of a woman can grab a man for a whole life."

It occured to me that people regularly google their names.  What if I post a list of names in the log of people I have been trying to reconnect with?  Will they google their names and see this site.

      He leaves June 15 and will be gone for about two years.  For now, this poem is my only response.  Yes, I know the sappy factor of the final line.   Doves  There are things that the body doesnât know The eyes donât see  And even the hand frying his eggs Gently prodding the yolks Cannot predict  Like the dove, who never assumed to Be a representative of peace And fights to the death over her nest Never knowing of the hurricane That in a weekâs time will prove her fight ineffective  I fought that battle More viciously than any dove  And for two long years  My young flew without me For two long years I pecked at the system I pruned my damaged feathers I brought mud and twigs to my marriage  I dug my tiny talons in- Twisted the world around And from the cage  Of the county jail I sang so loud and resilient That I brought my nest back together  But there are things that the body doesnât know The eyes donât see And even the hands pouring his coffee Scribbling their lunch money checks Could not predict  The hurricane rumbled out of my pores With the rain came the removal of the wedding ring With the winds came the battle of custody With the hail came visitation schedules And finally the lighting called him to war Threatening to burn down the tree  Home to the already fraying nest  There are things that the body doesnât want to know The eyes wonât look to see And even the hands that help to pack his things Will not predict But for his safety The heart can hope.

      Scottish Fest was enjoyable.  Alan did fine.  The kids were okay after...  We got there and realized that the admission prices were fairly high which made buying extras for the boys impossible.  Ayden seemed okay with this, but Trast got especially whiny and mean.  Alan took Ayden somewhere and I sat Trast down to explain to him that I could not afford to get the sword that he so wanted.  The result was heart break and tears which did not cease.  I held him for a few minutes while he sobbed, but he didn't stop.  I began to look for Alan and Ayden, but didn't see them.  I had no clear idea how much area the festival encompassed and I still had seen no sign of John, so I stood there getting angry and wanting to cry along with Trast.  Finally I saw John making his way towards us.  A few minutes later Alan and Ayden showed up.  Ayden was upset because Alan accidentally pushed him off of the swings.  So Ayden was running, I was running after him, Trast was running after me and everyone else looked on.  Once I got them to stand still John and his friends were nowhere to be seen.  I was just to the point of disbelieving that I had to pay admission for hell when John, Ned, and Ryan reappeared with swords AND helmets.  Ned is a nice guy, indeed, and my hero for the day.  On the way home the boys and I had a lengthy discussion about step parents.  They had many questions.  I answered as best I could.  Then Trast came up with a list of men I could marry in order for him to have multiple fathers.  Yikes to that.  Now I need to get Ayden out of the tub and help Trast get through this level of Super Mario Brothers.

      Roomy John, the kids, Alan and I are going to Scottish Fest tomorrow.  Sounds like fun, even though I'm of Irish descent.  I would feel more traitorish if it were British Fest.  Then on Sunday, Alan the kids and I are going to Zion.  The boy needs to do his laundry and I figured we'd take them fishing or hiking and have a cute little picnic.  That's a ton of time with Alan and the kids.  It makes me a wee bit nervous that he and Trast are going to butt heads the whole time and I'll have to ref.  I think I ought to have more faith in Alan, though.  He is an adult.   urlLink Cheese is funny.   After all of that excitement I also have a lot to do in the process of moving the kiddos in.  Trast is done with school because he's getting bullied in nasty ways and there is only a week left.  I just figured he could use that week to spend with Mitch.  It does make it a wee bit tougher to move all of their belonging in with them uderfoot.  Let's see is I come out of this next week with Sanity intact.

Work     Looking again, filing complaints for HQ  Love    Still in it.  I am most content in this area of my life.  It feels really amazing to have this.  Writing    I am doing a feature on June 14th.  Any questions on location and such, get ahold of me.

      Nikol, Is everything ok?  It has been a while since your last post, and you have me worried...  I hope that however you made them pay didn't land you in jail!  Keep me posted on everything and I think it's high time that you took a night and/or weekend off and came up here to see us. My busy life is starting to wind down, school year is over in 10 days, so that is the end to PTA, Girl Scouts and my class, now the busyness will be much more fun!   BTW, Jody's book is now available on BN.com and amazon.com.  The title again is "During" and the authors are Jody Glynn Patrick and Kevin Patrick.  I highly recommend it!  :)

      I have so much to think about right now that it makes me want to scream.  Boys rule my life.  My boys are moving in and I am trying to help them deal with Mitch's upcoming departure as well as establish a new, healthy routine for all of us.  The sad part is that right now sleep is in short supply.  Boys rule my life.  Alan doesn't know if he can handle being a "defacto" father.  Really, any adult would be in the position of being another adult around if they chose to be my friend.  In his case, he is the boyfriend.  He isn't ready for that kind of responsibility.  But he still loves me and wants to try.  I love him so much that it is stifling.  I just have my own concerns for myself and family.  I want someone that will stick around, fo' sho.  Boys rule my life.  Ned turned out to be a very cool man, indeed.  I like him.  I enjoy spending time with him.  I think he feels the same.  However, I'm sooooo hung up on ^^^^ the other boy that my head is full of rocks.  None of my friends are being especially helpful.  They hear me rant and they say, "You should do A."  Then I rant some more and they say, "You should do B."  Then they see the tight spot.  Boys rule my life.  Ugh.  But I do love them, anyway.

      I have to admit I have been a bit depressed.  Not as bad as  urlLink this  guy.  So, I've been spending time with Ned.  We inventoried a shit load of computer parts, then he bought me three adorable new bras from Victoria's Secret because my boobies have gotten smaller as well as my chest width.  I was using safety pins to hold my other bras on.  Then we went out for a very awesome sushi dinner.  It was a perfect evening.  I even got to laugh.  I needed that.  Now I am preparing to go to Andrea's reception.  I hate wedding receptions, but I love Andrea.  Wanna see duality of the world in action?     urlLink forward   then    urlLink back again   Oh, and to Sarah, I know.  You were right.  I mean it.  He was not ready for all of me.  I should have listened to you, but I am a stubborn butt head.  I appreciate that you can tell me what you think.  Right now I am just trying to distance myself from the pain of being  dumped  by that man/boy.  I have to hate him right now or it'll hurt for longer than it needs to.

      I'm sorry, I must say that I read Alan's poem and I thought it was complete crap. I have many more thoughts on it, some of which I already posted, then thought better of and took off, but I will keep the negative to myself.  I will just say one more thing on it, it had the look and feel of a poem written by a whiny high-school girl.  There, that was about the nicest that I could say. Nikol, hang in there, I may be a ways away, and we may not get to see each other due to shitty vehicles, but you are always in my thoughts.

      Alan posted this poem about me on his log.    I love her, and I knew I would from the moment I met her And now that weâre done I want her to know that Iâll never forget her And I know that though I look high and low thereâs nobody better She wanted to be together and I wish that I could let her But sometimes life is painful, too hard to trust And sometimes the rains cause two hearts to rust If Iâm too damn scared to say âforever or bustâ I need her to know for sure that it was never just lust I love the way she laughs, I hate the way she cries I love her pink hair, I love her purple eyes The falafel she fries when she cooks for me Or when she stomps her foot and throws the book at me Saying âLook at me! Take everything Iâve got to give!â But taking that means a life Iâm not ready to live I canât be a father to her beautiful kids And I canât drive an hour to the place she lives I told her: âStay,â now Iâm the one to go Because the man I am is the only me I know If I stayed, Iâd be playing her like G.I. Joe Without enough heart to pay the debts I owe I love her, and I want to keep her safe forever And Iâm not the man for that, so itâs now and never I could move the earth with a big enough lever And a place to stand; but whatâs after ever? Just more after; I bring tears and laughter And assassin love that lurks in the rafters To strike when you thought you were done with me Take three from four and make you one with me And youâre the one leftânot free to run with me The best I can say is have fun with me Drink rum with me, make bad puns with me Soak up the sun with me, come undone with me Get those clothes off, Iâm gonna make you come with me Iâll never forget when youâve done for me. You cried all day, we had a perfect night; We swept up the place and turned out the light; My last view of you was a beautiful sight; And it hurts, it does, but I know it was right.  I want you to know Because itâs so damn hardâ¦ I want you to know Because it could not lastâ¦ I want you to know Before it fades awayâ¦ I want you to know Weâll always have  this love     I really liked it, even though it basically says I am not good enough to keep him around even when things are rough.  So I guess I should post a poem about him on here.  Let me think.  Hmmmmmm....  Roses are red Violets are blue You suck, coward.  All in good fun, people.  Just remember, hell hath no fury...

      So, Ned helps me out a ton by driving me back to Whitewater on Tuesday since I didn't feel so great.  Then, yesterday the plan was that the kids and I would ride back with him and get my car from Milwaukee.  We got there just before real rush hour and decided to wait it out a bit at Ned's place.  At 6 we got out to my car and said our goodbyes.  Then I realized that I had no friggin keys.  I left them in Whitewater.  GRRRRR.  Luckily, John was willing do drive all the way there to bring my keys to me.

      I had my feature and it went so well!  I was a wreck all day leading up to it, but once I got on stage things went smoothly.  My comfort level on that stage was amazing.  The crowd listened and reacted well.  John even showed up.  Pyramid introduced me, which was so cool.  I love his poetry and it was such an honor that he was there.  Afterwards I got messed up and made an ass of myself.  No fun.

      Alas, the man I loved solidly for six months is no longer my boyfriend.  That situation was somethng awful to behold.  I nearly lost my mind in the break up process.    "So what happens now?     (Another suitcase in another hall) What happens now?      (Take your picture off another wall) Where am I going to?      (You'll get by.  You always have before.) Where am I going to?       (Don't ask anymore.)"  Tonight I am featured at a place called Linnemans.  I am a bit frightened that nobody will be there and I will have no energy.  I want the show to be good.  Right now I am so absolutely nervous that I can't sit still.    Wish me luck.
