        i once asked by a friend of mine on how long did chuck (my boyfriend) courted me? Then it occured to me that, though in our culture, courtship is something important, i realized that chuck never did court me. that minute i re-asses why did my boyfriend for seven years did not court me? was i that aggressive? am i sending 'wrong' kind of messages towards the male species? After a few minutes i figured out that it's been so long since i was single that i already forgotten the principles i am living for when i was in the 'dating arena'.   one funny thing that i remembered back then is the issue on 'ligaw', once there was a friend of mine who labels her self as somebody 'mega conservative' so conservative that she let's a guy court her for 4 years (all through out our college years) and that includes the common dating rituals (eg. hatid sa bahay, sundo sa bahay, libreng lunch, snack, minsan pati barkada niya, flowers, chocolates and of course tons and tons of 'papuri' form the guy like ang ganda mo, bagay sa iyo earrings mo and the likes). finally i had the perfect oppurtunity to ask her why that long? why four years? and then she answered with out blinking 'because we want to get to know each other'.   yeah right! like that's gonna happen! hah! get to know each other better, come on! that is the most hillarious statement i have heard that year. let's try to disect this matter so that we can understand it better.   point number one.  'ligaw' literally means ligaw, mislead. every guy you know will mislead you on this stage because he would only put his best foot forward so that you would give your 'matamis na oo'. it's like allowing him to lure you. hah! talik about submission.   point number two.  flowers. flowers. more flowers! i asked a couple of people what does flowers mean? what does it signify? they said it represents sweetness, love and the best part is the color and the type of flower has meanings too. if you try to disect this you would ask your self, is there a book that contains all of this? like da vinci code or something? now here is my wrath, flowers are the reproductive organs of all plants. if that is the case men are giving the women they claim to love or like 'vaginas' of plants. iw.   point number three.  chocolates! who doesn't want it? but the thing is chocolates has endorphines or happy hormones that takes effect when you eat it. *thesame reason why when your sad people would advice you to eat choco ice cream so that you will feel good) so, while eating you will be thinking of the guy who gave it to you, thus, you will feel good about the guy. shucks!   now, you question me on what to ask for a guy? nothing. women are intelligent. we don't have to be lured into relationships. don't even begin to think that i am cheap (and so what if i am?), it is just that i truly believe that if the guy was delivered by christ into your life, no amount of luring, no type/kind or color of flower, no brand of chocolate is needed to prove to a woman that you will do her good, that she will grow in all aspects of her life and that you will walk hand and hand in spreading God's words.    why settle for somebody who is presently there when you can have somebody who has the 'best quality'. and don't even begin to tell me that is impossible, it is not, with god nothing is impossible.

        most people would say that i have a bag of humor slinged on my right shoulder, so when people seems to be lonely, sad or they just have the regular dose of anxiety attacks they tend to look at me.  then they laugh  (at that point i try to understand that it is not my face that is funny, maybe it is my personality, now if that could be true should i not feel bad about myself?)    well, i came up with a lists of my unforgettable punchlines which some of you can use to brighten up your day:    SCENARIO ONE:    From a classic college story, one time i came to the classroom and i saw a friend of mine he was looking weary so i asked him-   JEN: O bakit ang lungkot mo?  FRIEND: Wala..may problem lang sa bahay...  JEN: Ano?  FRIEND Ewan ko ba feeling ko isa akong BLACK SHEPHERD   (the minute i heard the word black shepherd, i knew something was wrong but i wasn't able to pin point it there and then)    SCENARIO TWO:    FRIEND: Jen kain ka muna ng pruits...  JEN: Sige, ano bang meron?  FRIEND: Affles, Oranges meron ding Finya   (hmmm...speech defect?)    SCENARIO THREE:    This is a favorite in JSI   BOY: Miss Pwede ka bang ligawan?  JEN: Ngayon na?   (Daig ng maagp ang masikap!)    SCENARIO FOUR:    Try this masaya   STUDENT: Mam ang ganda nyo ngayon ah...  JEN: Kung maganda ako ano ka pa? Diyosa? tandaan mo papatayin ko kung may mas gaganda pa iyo!     SCENARIO FIVE:    Try this if you'd be a speaker for a seminar   FACILITATOR: Mam, how do we address you?  JEN: (All smiles) Former binibining pilipinas universe    *the facilitator will laugh her/his heart out as soon as she copes up with the shock     SCENARIO SIX:    Try this if you fel like you want to be hurt   Look at a person you don't know and start teasing him/her with an inanimate object (eg. chair, desks, ballpens)    SENARIO SEVEN:    When somebody asks you what is your profession tell him/her with out thinking twice that you are a 'MUSE'   JOB TITLE: MUSE  JOB DESCRIPTION: To inspire and to be beautiful at all times.    SCENARIO EIGHT:    Act like Melanie Marquez   (though personally i like her)    SCENARIO NINE:    Talk to my mom (she's ilonga)   NANAY: Jini, tilipon  JEN: Sino daw po nay?  NANAY: Jime daw...   Now was that Jaime or Jimmy...i guess i have to find out...    SCENARIO TEN:    Save the best for last.  Note: This is a true story   Listen to your father as he sing  'PUFF THE MAGIC RACOON'     *partida videoke yun...

       have you ever felt an extreme negative feeling about yourself that there are tasks that needs to be done but you feel that you are not good enough or that you are not equipped?   this is exactly what i felt when i was given a chance to disciple some of my students. initially i have no intentions of discipling students because in would create a situatinal paralysis because i am their teacher. i cannot perform simultaneous tasks of being their teacher and at the same time being somebody who would guide them spiritually, i feel that i am just a 'baby christian' (if there is such term).   i was busy reconciling the fears in my heart that i forgot what was discipling all about. discipling is not about YOU, in this case not about ME, not even close. discipling is a work cut for God. You can be a medium but you can never be the subject.   i almost kicked my self (if that would be possible) because i was so scared about the fact that i did not bother to stop and think (considering that i have a skull but then what's the skull for if my brain is not functioning that well) that it is never about us, it is all about God, that He had done so much for us.   truthfully, i know for a fact that some of my students sees me as a 'holy mega nice person' which i beg to disagree, it's just that everything that i do is not for me nor for my 'benefit'. i have been in love with God for almost a year and everyday seems like a day where in i am challenge to express even more how much i really love Him.   when your in love with God it's like your also inlove with a guy,you see, if you are inlove with a guy, you tend to talk about him a lot, everything he does, the minute you saw each other, you give meaning to a normal, average conversation. with God, the same thing happens, you tend to talk about Him a lot, you give meaning to his words (thru the bible), you give meaning to things he does (e.g your purpose in life).   most people see God as somebody who is hard to please, i myself sometimes find it hard, but everytime things get ugly in my life i practice 100% trust in Him. sometimes i get the itchy feeling to manipulate things on my behalf but that would only waste my time, energy and effort because i know for a fact that His Will Shall Be Done because its all about Him.        as of this moment i have three charges on my wings, and i am not nervous at all because with God nothing can go wrong.

        If I were to tell you that falling in love brings the best and the worst in you, would you label me as âanother ordinary, typical, dazed womanâ? Perhaps youâve already been in that state the minute youâve read the word âloveââ¦I mean come on, is it not one of the most âhackneyedâ (can be interchangeable with the word âcornyâ) topic you refuse to comment because âeverybodyâ has something to say about it.   If I were to tell you that my story is different would you believe me? Of course not! People assumed always that falling in love is something that is âuniversalâ everybody is bound to be in that state at least once in their period of existence.   If I were to tell you that you can fall in love for the rest of your life would you believe me?   If I were to tell you that it is possible not to have heart aches, rejections, tears, anger, fitting in, indifference would you believe me? Again a resounding NO, am I that âluckyâ to know a man that would not give me all of that.   If I were to tell you that I could share Him with you would you believe me? Now that would be nice huh? Donât worry I am in a sound mind and body while writing this and upon making that proposal.   You see, love as what they say is complex and itâs true, ever since I have met Him, He brought out the best and the worst in me. One thing that is surprising is that most of my worst became a strength and a motivating factor to improve my self to please Him, to make Him smile. Loveâs complexity allowed me to grow in the manner that he would prefer, most of the people I know would say ânever change for someoneâ at this very minute I beg to disagree, I am not ashamed to admit that even if I advocate womenâs liberation and individuality among females I have to say that in this instance I would have to lower my flagâ¦my pride in this context is not an issue. And when I say I want to share Him with you I really mean thatâ¦   I donât believe in the word luck, I go for the word âblessedâ.   To fall and not be hurt is possible, specially if the one on the other end is GOD.

        It was Wednesday.   2:58 PM   And as I walk towards the study area looking for a familiar face I realize that I am a nervous wreck, I havenât felt this much panic (the last time was when I had my MA thesis defense) if I were to switch into a descriptive words I have to go with the clichÃ© âbutterflies in my stomachâ not just butterflies but âa farm of butterfliesâ. I saw a student of mine and asked him where was the rest ? and he answered âwala paâ. There goes one of my dreaded phrases âwala paâ (e.g di makakarating, tayo-tayo lang ulit, may gagawin, busy and other alibiâs that I cannot contradict nor rebutt because I have no way of checking if it is true and whether I like it or not it is their life therefore their rights)   3:02 PM   A batch of students came. Same old faces. Well, I have to be ready for this. I was really mad at Him because We have been asking Him for âa harvestâ because He said that if there are willing workers then there will be a harvest. I am holding on to His words, to His promise, to something that I know inside my heart He would give.   3:06 PM   Another batch came. This time not that familiar. A smile slowly crept into my lips. Hmmmâ¦He has never forsaken anybody. This will be interesting. New faces waiting for the word. Coming in this secluded area of the university. A hunting thought came in. What if somebody found out? What if the admin found out? What if I get fired?   3:10 PM   Another batch came. This time itâs like half of my research class. I was afraid but at the same time really happy. I canât believe this. We have been praying for this for so long. All we need is a chance to prove that what were going to say is not âtypicalâ. What we are going to present is not an option.   3:15 PM   Three of my highly regarded students came with their friends (because they are âuncannyâ). They were about 8. I could sense that this would be a very fruitful afternoon.   4:07 PM   What happened between 3:16 to 4:06 was a remarkable event for me. I have officially witnessed a miracle. 30 students came to our cell meeting. 30 student praised and worshipped God. 30 students gave their time to see what are Godâs plan for them. 30 students believed that God is going to be in that meeting. 30 students prayed for a common goal. 30 students âwantedâ to hear the word of God. Three-Zero. I was thinking am I ready, are we ready to be Godâs army? What if I get fired? Where will I go?  I was jolted back to reality when I realized that it was not about me losing my job, that it was NOT about US being ready to be Godâs army. It is never about us. It is all about God. The question is not us being READY to share the word. God will do that. The Holy Spirit is on call.  I. I am just a figment. I cannot do it alone. But God has proven so many times how mighty he is. That his ways are always unconventional, unpredictable but equally effective and fitted for our purpose.

        My sister and I are total opposites. I donât even want to enumerate because it is endless. When I became a Christian I prayed very hard to God that let my sister feel what I am feeling and to cut the long story short God had granted my request. My sister became a Christian too. It made me ecstatic. Now we can go to church together, attend cell groups together and pray together.   One night while spending our quiet time we ended up fighting again and I was shocked because I thought we would never fight again. Because we are Christians and Christians donât fight. I was wrong.  Part of being a Christian was restoring broken relationships. And unknowingly I had a broken relationship with my younger sister. A broken relationship so long ago that I could not even remember why. She was crying and shouting words in my face and I chose not to answer because I was in awe. How could that happen. We are sisters. We donât have anybody other than each other. She moved out of our room that night and stayed in the room across ours. Around midnight she came back saying âsorryâ. I said sorry too, but what bothers me is the thought that this is just a temporary escape for something that has bee deteriorating a long time ago. Our friendship.   I asked her what happened and she was, like me, unsure but all she can remember is that she missed me a lot and that time I realized that I also missed my sister. I realized that I havenât been around her for a while, suddenly thereâs so many things that needs catching up. Whatâs her favorite show? Her favorite color? Her schedule in class? I felt numb. I felt as though my heart is pounding so hard that I might go into shock any moment.

        âOooooooooh my God!â¦I really have this feeling like âgame na kayo!â well, if that is the case then perhaps we should beginâ¦(in a disoriented manner) like, begin what? Oh my Godâ¦like I forgot why Iâm hereâ¦kidddddddding!. Well since we are all here and the stage is set and we have an audience and everything why donât you and I conduct a nerve wrecking yet satisfying intellectual intercourseâ. Did you know that Merriam Webster defines the word woman as a âfemale servant or attendantâ . You know whatâs worst Encarta Dictionary defines woman as a domestic employee. Yessssâ¦I mean I was like shock and everything because I wouldnât allow people to call me a servantâ¦me? A servant? With my flawless skin and perfectly manicured nailsâ¦a servant? Like Nooooooooo!.   So then I started to have tour of my book Word Origins and then I found the oddest word foundation, woman came from the English word wifman which means a âwife plus a manâ . And I was like âWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?ââ¦Of course I have this feeling that my daily dose of anxiety is slowly creeping in, I realized that I should observe one hundred percent feminist outlookâ¦(in an extra proud manner) for I am a woman!, then again I realized what do I mean when I say feminist? Wellâ¦(While talking to the audience) Of course a thinker like me knows what it meansâ¦feminist meansâ¦uhmmmmâ¦it means you always entertain bad thoughtsâ¦or was that pessimist?â¦Oh, oh I know it means your immature or was that childish? (to the audience) now, donât look at me like I donât know what Iâm talking aboutâ¦I know what feminism isâ¦in fact if I may declare I am one of themâ¦donât give that lookâ¦I amâ¦believe me I amâ¦what do you mean I donât look like oneâ¦FYI my mother is a feministâ¦what do you mean sheâs a housewife wearing a yellow apronâ¦how dare you!!! You stop it okayâ¦If you donât stop itâ¦If you donât stop itâ¦babatuhin kita ng kissa!!! Oh really nowâ¦I accept your challengeâ¦I will prove to you and to everybody that I am a feminist!   First, I know for a fact that âWomen constitute one half of the worldâs population, we perform nearly two-thirds of the worldâs tasks, and sad to say receives one tenth of the worldâs income and worst we own less than one-tenth of the worldâs propertyâ , talk about being a loserâ¦but what I donât understand is that if that would be the case then why are we still referred to as the weaker sex? Hmmmmâ¦actually we hate it! I mean we hate to be addressed in that mannerâ¦who wants to be refferred to as somebody weakâ¦like helloooooooooo!!! We hate the concept of categorizing, oh! by the way I let myself use the word categorize because as of this moment majority of the population living in this world refuse to use the word âdiscriminateâ, for it is politically incorrect. Perhaps they live in an alternate universe where health cutbacks does not constitute women, a place where politics is not male dominated and a situation where the knight-in-the-shining-armor syndrome is nonexistent.   Second, though I am planning to have my breast augmented just like Claudineâ¦Excuse me, I will just augment itâ¦I am not going to fix my breastâ¦my breast is just fine, it just needs a little improvementâ¦I mean I for one can afford it, I have money you knowâ¦nevertheless, even though I am planning to have my breast augmented just like Claudine I despise the exploitation of women on television, isnât bad enough that most men in our country dwell on the fact that women with a fair complexion and big boobs are considered to be beautiful if not attractive, I mean come onâ¦Filipinas are not mestizasâ¦that is one hell of a mistakeâ¦Filipinas are âmorenasâ that is why they need kissa papaya! Notions like that should be corrected from the inside, I mean isnât that a little bit shallow that you begin to have a false impression of a filipina whom you know since you were a kid. In addition, I also spurn the sight of âalmostâ naked women in noontime show. They are beings with brains, brains should be use, you use the brain when you begin to educate. Then the question would beâ¦Is there anybody who volunteers to educate them? To tell them that they have the ability to say NO if they feel exploited? That they have an option not to capitalize on their bodies?   Third, though sometimes itâs flattering specially if Piolo would be the one to commit the act, We hate it when men sees us as a piece of meat! We are not meat from the sleekiest market in town, in fact sometimes I feel like Iâm an armani suit that most men like to wearâ¦it hurts me, why? What do you mean why? You know what, when you sell your brainâ¦itâll be really, really expensiveâ¦you know why? Of course you donât know whyâ¦It has never been used! Well thatâs enough, again We hate the very thought that men looks at us as though we are a piece of meatâ¦we are notâ¦believe it or not our existence have a purpose and that is to live in absolute equality. Why do we have to symbolize alcohol, cigarettes and other God forbidden vices? I mean why men model itâ¦they are the primary consumer of the product? Wait! Yesâ¦tito boy! Okei tito boyâ¦bye tito boy! Itâs tito boy I have to cut this shortâ¦I have an appointment, What? Well I happen to love antiques!   So what am I trying to point out? pure and simple. Women are intelligent. That is flat fact. Now donât begin to ask me for proofs I might give it to you and I need more than 365 and Â¼ days to enumerate them. For men like John Nash, Pierre Curie, and John Kennedy a womanâs wisdom has become evident that history even took notice of it. I came here to tell you that women âalwaysâ thinkâ¦like men we also had the opportunity to acquire a âbrainâ and we intend to use it. And one more thing get rid of the quote âbehind a great man is a great womanâ We donât need to be behind any man, we can be beside them or even in front of them. Let us put into argument the long time dispute regarding women empowerment. Women Power is not a theory nor a concept it is an existing truth that needs to be practiced and prime. For years we have been combating Human Rights specially dedicated to women. Let us put a stop to it. Letâs practice it.

        For years my head has been struggling to answer one questionâ¦Why are the people in our country so fragmented?â¦Why are there so many factions in government? in the military? in business? in the communities? In the studentry?â¦There is what we call right wing and then there is the left wing? In the university where I came from we call them âtibakâ; âaktibistaâ; or worst âNPA wanna beâs.â   And for years, I have been listening modestly and patiently on what they have been sayingâ¦ 10 percent comment about capitalism, 10 percent comment about equality, 25 percent comment about social strata and a humongous 55 percent comment about Good Governance. They say that our country lacks it. That our country should have it!   But what I forgot to ask them is What is good governance in the first place? Does it mean that if our country would have this, it would belong to the first world? that if our country could acquire this, then there would be economic stability in our country? If our country can have good governance, does this mean that we can have a fair share on the issue of WTO? Or should we even use the word GOOD and GOVERNANCE in one sentence?   A couple of years ago, issues have been heaping up in our country, workers demand for the P125 across-the-board increase which was not really met, issues about Indigenous Community Militarization, which again killed dozens of Aetas, Manobos and Hanunuo since our indigenous brothers did not agree with the conversion of their tribesâ land into militarized areas, a series of Oil price hikes and then a few rollbacks which just like the previously stated events all ended in favor of lobbying groups. If you will take a look at all of these issues, they have a common groundâ¦they are all government concerns.   The Philippine Government has been claiming all along that it is democraticâ¦that we are very lucky since it is one of the freest countries in the worldâ¦that our government was made by the people, for the peopleâ¦that our government system is IDEAL. Come to think of it, ideal is synonymous to perfect and since grade four my often quoted motto is NOBODY is PERFECT. In this context, I could safely assume that the Philippine Government has been lying all along, that its claim about idealism is a lie.   I am 18 years old. I am a student. I value education. I try to be an asset to my country. But I can only do so much. While most of my peers value signature items and gossips about their latest varsity crushes, I prefer to sit down and ask questions about my country. If government officials have been claiming that ours is an ideal form and I find out that it has been lying all alongâ¦what should I do?   To be honest, I do not know. Perhaps the answer would be to demand good governance from each citizen. But the problem is that the youth, like me, lack influence in formulating public policies. Our exclusion is caused by both external and internal barriers. The external barriers have to do with a âculture of apprehensionâ; reflective of the generation gap that tends to breed a sense of mistrust and misunderstanding between adults and youth. It is also reflected in the government and other decision-making bodies that do not bother to involve young people in policy development. Instead, young people are generally treated as the "next generation" and "leaders of tomorrow." The internal barriers relate specifically to youth, who often fail to see themselves as actors in decision-making processes. This is partly the result of never being taught that they have a role to play in making policy decisions, and partly a result of youth organizations lacking the necessary skills and strategic thinking to make inroads into policy circles. This brings me to the query Does it have something to do with budget cutting on educational funds every time there is a national emergency? Why does it have to be the educational funds?   I remember when Nelson Mandela delivered his speech in the African Youth Convention. He firmly stated that a time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices - submit or fight. And as of this moment I believe that there is nothing left for the youths of today to do but to fight and demand for good governance. It is our right and it is our responsibility.   Involving us young people in policy-making is important. It provides opportunities to build skills and learn from experiences that will serve us well throughout our lives. It will help us combat cynicism about politics and politicians, It will give us a first-hand understanding on how decision-making processes function. It will strengthen the civil society - will demonstrate the value of the public sector and of public service. At the same time, it will give us the chance to participate in the development of communities â in social, economic, cultural, and political terms. Lastly, it will help us disprove the multitude of negative stereotypes about youth that continue to exist.   Asking questions does not mean one is practicing treason. Demanding for an answer will not make one commit sedition. I call these two involvement. Youths are not ânext generationâ scenarios, we are happening today, this very minute and we are assets longing to be tapped by our country. We should not be afraid of growing slowly, we must be afraid only of standing stillâ¦Of doing nothing for the country that has been our shelter, our protection, our home.  Good governance is not a gift. Youths like us have the right to Demand for it...Work for itâ¦and Assume Responsibility for it. Who so neglects learning in his youth, loses the past and is dead for the future!    Entry Chest Foundation  Oration Contest  Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila

        Great! Just great! I Iâm suppose to rest but how could I, if youâre in my room!â¦Well excuse me it just so happened that I am as tired as a horse and I need to take my rest before the director shouts againâ¦Iâll be acting in about an hourâ¦Well yesâ¦I amâ¦I am an actressâ¦what type of actress? Movie actressâ¦how come you didnât saw me? Of course you saw meâ¦youâre just to busy drooling over an actress that are more popular but doesnât have the talent and the guts to perform death defying stunts!â¦Yesâ¦Yesssssss! I am a stunt womanâ¦is there a problem with that! Gotcha! Impressive huh!!!   There goes that face again, wipe it off, wipe it off!â¦every time I would tell people about my âprofessionâ they stare at me as though I am the oddest person aliveâ¦No, I donât want to be just a stunt womanâ¦like most struggling actresses, I do aspire to be some type of a starâ¦mega star, superstar, star for all season, star apple, falling star, five star, star fish, star dancer and the likesâ¦me, I want to be- the Universal Star! Noooâ¦what do you mean itâs a brand of fireworks, Lusis? What Lusis?â¦hmmmâ¦it means I would be popular both in and out of our countryâ¦I would be our countryâs pride, our countryâs Mascot?â¦you ha! Noooâ¦I am a very good actressâ¦in fact back in college I got 1 flat on my drama and reforming artsâ¦my teacher told me that Iâve got potentialâ¦ahâ¦the good old daysâ¦the days where in I got to recite linesâ¦today I am very lucky if I got to improvise and the director would always take a shot of my back or my 35 degree angleâ¦Sometimes at nightâ¦tears would flow from my eyesâ¦a hungering pain would creep in my chestâ¦then I start to sing the aches that I feelâ¦Bongga ka day! Bongga ka day! Sige langâ¦ Sige langâ¦Itaas ang kilay mo! Ngayon!  Yeahâ¦I feel unhappy at times specially at the rate of the Philippine movie industryâ¦our countrymen is to some extent uncanny when it comes to movie preferenceâ¦allow me to discussâ¦   Filipino loves action flicksâ¦action movies where the lead character will never die, immortal would be the precise termâ¦even if there are batallion straying bullets to himâ¦the lead character would always manage to defeat them allâ¦he would carry with him a magical 45 calibreâ¦why magical? Because it will never run out of bullets! have I mentioned that the lead character is always a target shooterâ¦3 to 5 kilometers and he would still hit the target! Is the bullet sometime of a heat sensor?   Of course if there is a lead character then there will be a leading ladyâ¦somebody fair, somebody weak, somebody with a nose bridge as high as the Eiffel tower, somebody who has boobs courtesy of Dr. Vicky Be-lank! Hmmmâ¦I am a little carried awayâ¦but rest assured that this leading lady needs to be rescued and once rescued this leading lady would fire guns at her abductors not so surprisingly she would always hit themâ¦and get a load a thisâ¦she never fired a gun in her life!!! Can we consider that to be a skill?   Of course prior to the kidnap they have to âmake loveâ they would have an opportunity to have physical contact, they would share an âunforgettable nightâ togetherâ¦was that the reason why the leading lady needs to be rescuedâ¦because they need to share another âunforgettable nightâ¦hmmâ¦maybe that is the reason why at the end of the movie they would always share a passionate kiss? Would that kiss lead to sex? Can we consider that to be premarital?  And every time she would attempt to escape she would fall down and get hurt making it easy for the bad guys to get her again! Of course, once they catch her, her clothes would be torn into pieces exposing her fine, voluptuous and well characterized formâ¦hmmmâ¦thank you very mush science!   Filipino action flicks always evolve on the theme revenge! Somebody was killed, somebody from the family tree of the action star, his father, mother, sister, brother, grandparents, grandparents of his parents, friends, enemies, pets, acquaintances or somebody he doesnât knowâ¦ahhhhâ¦there goes your plot! And once the lead actor finds out the near dead body of the father, mother, sister, brother, grandparents, grandparents of his parents, friends, enemies, pets, acquaintances or somebody he doesnât know would still recite a five page dialogueâ¦which will never include the person who executed the crimeâ¦every time he would mention the name he would see the glowing light at the far endâ¦  During the stunts there will be âunreasonable explosivesâ trees would explode, water would explode, grass would explode and if a car would explode it would convert into a junk first! My director calls this cost cutting!   On the duel scene both the antagonist and the protagonist on the middle of gun firing would recite dramatic lines as long as the Sumulong highwayâ¦would you believe that, and once face with each other they would both find out that their guns donât have bullets, so they would throw it away, and begin a fist fightâ¦that would last for about 15 minutes and they would get cuts on the following body parts, the corner of the upper right eye brow, the lower left of their lips and a bleeding cut to the neckâ¦   Naturally one of them would see a gun and they would fight over it, until the antagonist will accidentally pull the trigger towards his body, talk about a loser! Infact, antagonist in our country is poorly developedâ¦picture this, a guy wearing leather jacket, with the temperature in our countryâ¦let me remind him we are a âtropicalâ nation, he has to address his groupies as âmga bataâ, he would always hold the gangs meeting in an abandoned warehouse or in more popular terms âbodegaâ and he has to wear shades all the timeâ¦is he a vampire?   Lastly, the Philippine movie reflects the Philippine Police as somebody who is always late! The police would arrive after all the bad guys have been killed by our action heroâ¦they would be in uniform or in some silly head âdoââ¦  It is bad enough that our country was defined as semi-feudal, semi-colonial in terms of working orientation, it is bad enough that our country values social classes, it is bad enough that our country categorize its people in accordance with the social orientation, it is even worst how the Philippine cinema depicts our lives.   Out of ten cinemaâs 8 would be foreign film, which includes pathetic horror films from our neighboring countries and 2 local flick which would only evolve into two main theme an extreme interpretation of life like a family of prostitutes or a massacre gone extremely mad or a fairytale elucidation of the Philippine societyâ¦a rich marrying a poor, an educated falling for somebody who wears a leather vest and would recite âtaas na kamay ko sa iyo, mahal na nga kita palagay ko ehâ¦maging sino ka man!â totally weird! Our movie industry is like everything you want to happen in your life, it is so idealâ¦sad to say ideal is synonymous to perfectâ¦in this semi-feudal, semi-colonial world there is no such thing as perfect.

         Congrats, you're Mystique! ...Or is that just another one of you tricks? No one really knows with you, because you change your identity so often! You're actually a very tragic character, but no one cares because you're a violent, coniving bitch. Your shape-shifting powers make you the perfect spy and assassin, but despite your awesome powers and fighting skills, you're stuck at home baby-sitting the Brotherhood. No one seems to appriciate you, either. Many people hate you, but that's okay, because you hate them right back. Stop being angry and spend some time alone with the real "you"- not just another shape.    urlLink   *~*Which X-Men Evolution Villain Are You?*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla         I AM 52% PUNK ROCK!

       ihad a nice time last Saturday because after the church service my cellmates andi had plans; actually it was not really a plan we just wanted to get a cup of coffee afterwards.    i donât know what was so special about âthat dayâ thati was really excited, in fact I saved some money just to be sure that I will have enough. On my way back home while riding the infamous mega taxi, I came to a realization- I was not actually excited about  âwhat was going to happen that dayâ  I was excited because of  âwhom I will be withâ .  I remember a few months ago, I was really frustrated because I was all fired up (as a christian) and I wanted to have a cell of my own, spread the word of God and advance His kingdom, but what ever I do it seems like nothing would pass through.  I have invited a lot of people to go and attend our Saturday (even friday)service but most of them would always reason (if not weasel) their way out. I have invited friends of mine but sad to say they donât dig things like this, they told me that their schedule  would not coordinate  with the time of the church service (in fact I was wondering until now, what was Godâs reaction towards that? I mean how could you say that your work/school would not be a second priority before Godâs, who is your God in the first place, hmmmâ¦.).  To be honest I was really hurt when the dawn of truth arrived,  they  are  not  interested, plain and simple, according to one of the most popular  âpinoyâ  saying  âkung ayaw may dahilan, pag gusto may paraanâ  and the saddest thing is that I have to find out all about it first hand, but I am not going into details because I have a much more important thing to point out.  I started to smile as the mega taxi turned left to bonifacio street, because of a funny thought that came in my head, a few months ago  âiâ  wanted a cell of my own, but what I forgot was-  Does God want me to have a cell of my own?      Funny, but last june we started a cell in adamson with my fellow Christian friends, and I said that having a cell would be my last priority because I wanted to focus more on the facilitating side, but guess what? One of my student came to me and ask if I could give her a one to one, which of course means that she would be my cell, later that day for some reason I approached one of my female student and asked her if she wanted me to give her a one to one and then the next day another student approached me, so all in all I have four cell mates. And I was overwhelmed by the fact that I was really stupid for  looking and not seeing .  I have been grieving a lot about my lost opportunity to disciple my âso-calledâ friends (I used the term âso-calledâ not because I am mad but because I donât think we are still friends, I think we have grown apart and they havenât been that interested to me or to the things I do, donât get me wrong I still and will always love them but I canât change my persona whenever I am around them, I will always be a Christian and a daughter of God) that I havenât been sensitive towards the people around me.  I may have lost my âold friendsâ but I have gain a  âfamilyâ  (spiritual family to be precise)   through my new cellmates. These are Women whom I can grow in spirit with, Women whom I can laugh with, Women I can trade secrets with, Women whom I can be moody with and most of all Women whom I can praise, worship and experienceGod with.  Truly, God always works wonders and I know he would always continue to amaze me, and the truth I am always looking forward in experiencing his work first hand.         To jem, charisse, shane and joan we still have a long way to go but I know that it would be a triumphant journey because you are with me and We are with God.

        truth of the matter âoverwhelmingâ is the thought that there are people checking my site (as if there is something significant in my spot), one reason why I get inspired in writing vital (i think) point views in my âsolace. lately i havenât been writing a lot because i was busy checking papers for my writing classes plus i have been slaving around with my classâ thesis (and i know for a fact, even if i am deeply hurt, my subject have been occupying a lot of my studentâs time, imagine saturdays and sundays that they have to see each other because they need to ârehashâ and âaddâ more facts to their proposal, they have been seeing each other mondays thru fridays, then they have to see each other again during weekends,  nakakaumay!)   i was once alarmed by the fact that âchikaâ have been circulating about me that i terribly give âlowâ grades. at first i was disturbed, because itâs not true, i mean as far as i know i give grades in accordance to what they deserve, i am not saying that most of my students are âslowâ or âstupidâ, but the reason why they are in school is because they have to  âlearnâ  and to have âsky rocketing gradesâ are just secondary.  i know that some might react and tell me that getting high grades is part of their âuniversity lifeâ but at least try to grasp this-  how many students come to school to actually learn? how many students come to class to âgraduateâ? to get their diploma?   you see students in this generation are far more concern on the ânumbersâ they get (grades) than the actual learning experience. in fact, i would always end my lessons early not because i want to but because there are no students, and i mean no students who asks me questions that would produce a worthwhile âintellectual intercourse'.  i for one believe that  âeducation is not a compromiseâ . you go to school to learn and grades are just a prima facie on how you actually performed during the semester. kids these days get high grades because they resort to ânot soâ good techniques in claiming what they think they deserve. they loose their integrity and their humanity because they act as if it is the only option available. they thought professors never notices the way they tilt their head to look at their classmates answer, on how they centralize their eyes on the person whom they think has the right answers. i mean they party the night before and then they also want to get high grades the next morning? they want the best of both worlds; the word priority doesnât mean anything to them?  kung makakahamig- hahamig .  so my solution to that is to always give essay or analysis for examination. one teacher asked me  âdiba mahirap yang chekan?â  i answered  âyup, but this is the only way i could motivate my students to speak their mindsâ  then my colleague answered  âpano kung daanin ka sa chika?â  so i answered back âchika o hindi iâd still get an ounce of what they thinkâ.  education can never be a concession, a kid should get the grade that he/she deserves, i am not saying that teachers should not give them âconsiderationsâ in the numerical sense but I think it would be better for the students to walk tall knowing that the grades they have is something that they actually earned.  a lot of students seek their teacherâs favor because they want an easy way map for the semester, what they donât get is that if the teachers liked them personally, the expectations from the professor becomes higher, leaving a little for consideration.  so the key,  make learning the priority .

        one thing that i cannot fully grasp about some people around me is the fact that they can easily assign 'brackets' to things, places,even individuals. they tend to 'label'  everything. they assign status to almost anything. read on for examples-   1. if you do some 'dirty' sign using your middle finger, you're cool.   2. if you use 'scandalous' shirts (with labels such as 'pornstar in training' or b*tch in the making) you're a rockstar!   3. if you wear converse sneakers and look angry or at least look somewhere along the line of confuse/sober you are soooo in.   4. if you can provide an 'orphan comment' from marx, chairman mao, engels or other 'mortal'intellectuals you are above average.   but, if you start to talk about God, people would feel nauseas, as if what you are talking about is contagious and they would have the following reactions-   *note these are all true stories most of the time i get reactions like these when i  evangelize some of my students or invite them to our weekday cell meet-   1.maâm una na po kamiâ¦ (saan kayo pupunta?)  2.sabunin mo man ako di ako mag-papalit ng religion (bakit?!!!)  3.di pa ako readyâ¦(saan?)  4.mam may gagawin pa po ako ehâ¦(ano? tatatanga o mag se-self pity?)  5.mam sayang di ako pwedeâ¦(sayang talaga!)  6.mam di po ako pinayaganâ¦(na ano?)  7.mam sorry di po ako makaka-attendâ¦(di ka dapat sa akin nag so-sorry)  8.mam pagod po akoâ¦(buti na lang di napapagod si God!)  9.mam hindi ko po âtripâ yan eh (what will you do if God would say to your face (na alam naman nating di mangyayari because he is a loving God) na di ka niya âtripâ pare)   my personal favorite*   mam atheist akoâ¦di ako naniniwala na my Godâ¦(talaga? if people like you donât believe in him bakit kailangan nyong i-proclaim?, if truly you donât believe in Him you shouldânt even mention his name for relatively he should not exist in your world!)   you see, even if we deny his presence a thousand times we need God. But what I donât understand is why most people âcontactâ him when it is convenient for them, making him an option in their lives. When things go wrong in our lives we âalwaysâ call him, not to ask for help but to blame him for everything. we tell him (if not declare) that he is unfair, that we donât deserve this, that we are to good for incidents like these. these things can be avoided.   why choose to live a journey that you will traverse âaloneâ when you can have an opportunity to âtravel with Himâ.   what happened to me when i became a christian is unforgettable-   1.i lost my friends.  2.according to some i lost my âthrillâ  3.i became a âsquareâ (boring)  4.i became annoying for i always talk about God (because they believe that there better things to do other than knowing God)  5.i have problems with my personality for i lack compassion on what they do (such as pre-marital sex, drinking, smoking, drugs, etc) which is true.  6.i attended church  7.i read the bible (which they really find âcornyâ if i may quote a friend of mine âwala na bang ibang pwedeng basahin?â)  8.i pray on public areas (specially when saying grace before eating a meal)  9.i make them feel like they are bad (that was unintentional)  10.i give poor advice (because my advice would always concern Godâs will)   the funny thing is that even if i felt bad about those things, i have no regrets of accepting Christ as my personal Lord and Savior because i know i am not missing out on worldly things.
