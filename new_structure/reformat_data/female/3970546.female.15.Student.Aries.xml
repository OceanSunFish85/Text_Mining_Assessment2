      Yesterday Derek didnt play, he had on one of those removable casts. He looked really cute though lol. Oh well we won anyway 10-3 against the bluejays. Yea i know, not much competition, but a win is a win. Yesterday i had an eyedoctor appointment. O my gosh i hate the part when you get those air puffs in your eyes. She always catches me on a blink. its so annoying. But all in all my eyes were great she said. After that i went to the store to pick up a few things and then i came home and watched the yankee game. yeah it was pretty boring. I hope today is a little more exciting.

      Omg, there is a rumor going around that the Yanks are thinking about trading Posada for Randy Johnson. ARE THEY ON CRACK!!!??? I am so pissed off!!! i mean come on, the unit has like 3 years left before he retires and posada is just coming into his own as one of the top catchers in the league. As far as our pitching goes, well yea we do need more help. Mike should be coming off the DL any day now, i have no clue what Brown is doing. Jose Contreras, well ever since his family has come back from cuba, hes been automatic, i guess we really do need more help. But couldnt we give someone away besides posada? Don't get me wrong, i love Giambi, but he hasnt been performing lately, i think we could live without him. Maybe bubba crosby could play first instead of outfield, he has been a promising prospect (needless to say how cute he is lol) Anyway i just hope these rumors are false.

      This is a poem/song that i wrote a few days ago...   Ya know, its really frustrating How there can be so many men in this world and yet there aren't that many for me I walkdown the street and all i see Is hands entwined, lips locked, mirrored smiles Maybe i should just shut myself inside for a while  Okay this is becoming a serious problem Look at me, i mean really look at me Is my hair not cool enough? Are my clothes out of style? Do I not say the cool things like other girls do? Maybe i should just shut up for a while  Guess what! Emotions Suck! What if i found a switch in my brain where i could turn off my feelers and just walk around like a robot Yea that would work for me I'll start lookin for that button right now Maybe I should just wait a little while
