      I'm listening to Bedouin Soundclash... what an incredibly talented group of guys. I was introduced to them at Hillside last night. They have their own style of reggae and the lead singer's voice is very Bob Marley-esque. They had everyone up on their feet last night. I only wish I didn't have to leave to find my friend Rob halfway through their set. I got back just as they were finishing their second last song.  I discovered that the lead singer of The Remnants was my boyfriend in grade 6. Yup, no lie. I ran into Kenny at the merch tent early in the afternoon yesterday and we caught up for a bit. I remember he gave me a ring back in the day when we were 11.... ah, the memories.  I want to get over her. I want to get her out of my head so fucking badly. She's sucking the heart out of me and rendering me emotionally immobile. I should have seen this coming.... well, I did sort of see this coming, but I took my chances anyway. I kept my distance from her and didn't let myself get too involved, but I'm still having a hard time. Imagine what it would have been like if I had really let myself go? Damn.... I don't want to think about it.  I don't want to want her. I don't want to think about her anymore in that way. All I want is a friendship with her... but I have a feeling that's easier said than done with her. I'm the sort of person, if I feel a connection with someone, I'd rather have them in my life as a friend and get to know them on that level than not have them at all. I think that might be a tad bit more difficult for her. She feels as though she has to keep this emotional distance between her and anyone that she thinks she might have actual feelings for. It's retarded. Why she's choosing to miss out on getting to know someone that might actually be good for her is beyond me. I'll never understand it.  I just want to be her friend. I don't want her to shut me out of her life completely. I think she's an incredibly talented, intelligent, compassionate person and I feel lucky that she came into my life when she did. In the short time that we were together, she taught me a lot about myself... more specifically, what I can handle in a relationship. I discovered that I'm a lot more chill about open relationships and polyamoury than I thought I was. I'm not sure when or if I would have learned that about myself, if I hadn't started seeing her.  But now, here I am.... wondering why we can't continue what we had. I know she says that she can see herself getting attached to me and she needs to put a stop to this because she has feelings for me, but fuck. Why can't we just go with it? I'm not the type of person to put demands on her time... and I would never compromise her freedom, because I value mine so much. She has no idea how I feel about her and how strongly I feel that we might actually be good for each other.   So, we're "on pause"... whatever the hell that means. I should just drive to her house right now and tell her that I think we should "unpause" this thing.... that she should just give it a chance. If only I had the balls.... The one thing I know for sure is, she needs to know how I feel about her. She's been so open and honest with me about how she feels about me, it's only fair that I do the same for her. I don't feel like I owe it to her, but I feel like she deserves it.  Or maybe I'm doing exactly what she needs right now... maybe she needs to have feelings for someone that she thinks doesn't give a shit about her. I've done a very good job over the past several months, not letting on that I might actually give a damn about her. I've been very nonchalant and, as far as I know, she thinks I couldn't care less about her. Maybe she needs to know what it feels like to want someone that doesn't want her. Maybe that's why she "paused" it. Maybe she was afraid that her feelings weren't returned. Who the fuck knows?  I've always trusted my gut... my gut hardly ever fails me... and my gut is telling me that it's not the right time to tell her. I will tell. I just think maybe, just maybe... if I wait it out awhile, by the time I feel ready to tell her, she'll be in the position where she can actually accept it and appreciate it and process it. She's had so many people want her lately.... so many people confessing their love for her and whatnot. One more person isn't gonna make a mark. BUT... if I wait until she feels lonely. Until she feels like she might have actually missed out on something real.... I might get somewhere.  I feel strongly about certain people... I felt it with S. right away and I felt it with her right away. The morning after the first night we met and made out at the bar, I felt it. I knew I was in trouble with this one. I knew that she was the one that I was gonna pursue. I love a challenge. This girl has definitely been my biggest challenge to date. But I'll get her.... just give me time.

      Well, here's the blog. I'm not sure if anyone will even read this, seeing as how I don't plan on making it a well known fact that it exists. I need a place to rant and ramble semi-anonymously. The other online journal is read by too many people who know me in "real life." I find myself constantly backspacing and re-wording a lot of things that I write in it, knowing that everyone will read it.  I need to be free to let loose some verbal vomit (or something like that... err, yeah). Hopefully this thing will be a useful tool.
