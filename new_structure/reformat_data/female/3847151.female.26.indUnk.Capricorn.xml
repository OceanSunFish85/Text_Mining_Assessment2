      The July 2004 National Geographic Magazineâs cover is a picture of a female guerrilla labeled  âCocaine Countryâ . Although, the reality of most Colombian far away regions is that there is no presence of official institutions and that poor peasants have no other alternative to earn other than growing cocaine leaves, I find this article too shallow and short in describing a complex issue such as drug trafficking and its implications for my country.  I accept that I am speaking from the bottom of my âinsultedâ Colombian patriotic heart. I think , however, that we have a right to feel this way.    This is what I posted on the  urlLink National Geographic website :   âMy father has been a NGM subscriber since the 70âs. During this time, Colombia has never, to my knowledge, been granted a NG cover. As a Colombian, I was greatly affected by the editorialâs decision to inaugurate Colombia as a front cover with an article labeled âCocaine Countryâ. I wonder why the Spanish version of NGM has a different cover, the article about the sun, and whether it was a strategy to minimize the controversy this article is generating.   Colombianâs have had to learn to live with an image strongly related to the production of cocaine, and I think this article will reinforce the negative international image that we have tried to deal with for so long. I think no Colombian can deny that cocaine is the most complicated problem in our country, it reflects our inability to attack poverty and inequality. However, front covers like this have the side effect of reinforcing the only internationally recognized characteristic of our society. â

      Es viernes y tengo un guayabo horrible. Esto de pretender ser productivo cuando uno tiene la cabeza dando vueltas es un poco pretencioso. Inclusive, debo admitir que hasta escribir esto me esta causando trabajo. Y no sÃ³lo es el guayabo fÃ­sico sino el moral, porque a parte de tomar la no muy inteligente decisiÃ³n de emborracharme un jueves a punta de aguardiente, tambiÃ©n tomÃ© la no muy sabia decisiÃ³n de no llegar nunca a mi casa. Pero bueno, espero que el efecto de los dos males anteriormente descritos, como siempre, los cure el tiempo.   Ayer conocÃ­ a alguien con quien no tuve empatÃ­a. Fue muy raro, porque por lo general a mi me cae bien todo el mundo. La verdad acepto que esa persona que conocÃ­ sacÃ³ a relucir algunas de las inseguridades que tengo sobre las decisiones que he tomado y que voy a tomar en no muy corto tiempo. Y tambiÃ©n me hizo acordarme que cada vez es mas difÃ­cil conseguir personas con las cuales se estÃ¡ totalmente a gusto. Hay que estar preparado, y tener la certeza que los amigos, aÃºn lejos, son los amigos.   Y para cerrar mi correo favorito de las Ãºltimas semanas:  âTrust Me On The Sunscreen   If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proven by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.  I will dispense this advice now.  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.  Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.  Do one thing every day that scares you.  Sing.  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.  Floss.  Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.  Stretch.  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't.  Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.  Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.  Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good.  Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.  Travel.  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  Respect your elders.  Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.  Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.  Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.  But trust me on the sunscreen. â

      Â¿Por quÃ© este blog se llama  Purple Hayes ? El nombre hay que atribuÃ­rselo a Rodrigo Orrantia, quien desde hace aÃ±os me canta â"Carolina Mary Rojas  Purple Hayes " al son de la conocida canciÃ³n "Purple Haze". SegÃºn dicen Ã©sta hace referencia a la bareta. Los que me conocen sabrÃ¡n que es muy poco probable o prÃ¡cticamente imposible verme bajo los efectos de este alucinÃ³geno. Sin embargo, Purple Haze rima con  Purple Hayes , y ya. Eso es todo.   Por otro lado, estuve pensando sobre lo que quiero hacer con este blog. La esencia del blog hasta donde la entiendo, es que uno escribe sobre las loras que tiene en la cabeza. Dado que en mi son frecuentes las loras, consignarlas en uno solo lugar y con algo de orden parece una buena idea. Tengo varias pero para no aburrir a todo el mundo las voy a ir escribiendo por etapas.   La de hoy es la siguiente:  SegÃºn un estudio del Convenio Andres Bello los colombianos con educaciÃ³n superior que se consideran lectores leen en promedio 9 libros al aÃ±o.  Me pareciÃ³ una cifra impresionante, de hecho Carolina Pastrana me contradijo un rato diciÃ©ndome que el promedio de libros leÃ­dos en Colombia era inferior a dos. De acuerdo, pero esta estadÃ­stica se refiere a aquellos quienes pudieron ir a la universidad. La verdad me dio como pena, porque en el 2003 estuve lejos de llegar a este promedio (que vergÃ¼enza!!) Debido a lo anterior uno de mis New Year's Resolutions del 2004 (inspirado por uno de Lulu) fue leer al menos 6 libros. Voy por ahÃ­ en 5 asÃ­ que por el resolution bien, pero por el promedio nacional hay que trabajar. El hecho es que nueve, considerando el nivel de rumba que muchos tienen en esta ciudad es bastante. Hay que pensarlo excluyendo los libros que por trabajo hay que leer. Mejor dicho, a tomar menos, dar menos lora y leer mas para hacer honor a la estadÃ­stica.  No escribo mas para que a la gente no le de mamera leer. DespuÃ©s mi siguiente lora.

      Hoy, julio 5 de 2004 empieza la historia de este blog. No se para que lo armÃ© y para que sirva pero me parece divertido ver que pasa.  Â¿Que ha pasado? Pues que me ganÃ© una beca para ir a hacer una MaestrÃ­a en Estados Unidos, y tengo un laptop nuevo (eso explica lo del blog). Muchas cosas por hacer y me pareciÃ³ buena idea tener un sÃ³lo lugar donde recompilar lo que esta pasando. Bueno, eso era todo, por ahora

      Hablando de canciones y letras tristes ahÃ­ va " The scientist"  de  Coldplay   "Come up to meet you, Tell you I'm sorry, You don't know how lovely you are.  I had to find you, Tell you I need you, Tell you I set you apart.  Tell me your secrets, And ask me your questions, Oh, let's go back to the start.  Runnin' in circles, Comin' up tails, Heads are a science apart.  Nobody said it was easy, It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard. Oh, take me back to the start.  I was just guessing, At numbers and figures, Pulling your puzzles apart.  Questions of science, Science and progress, Do not speak as loud as my heart.  Tell me you love me, Come back and haunt me, Oh, when I rush to the start.  Runnin' in circles, Chasin' tails, Comin' back as we are.  Nobody said it was easy, Oh, it's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be so hard. I'm goin' back to the start.  owwwwwwww awwwwwww... owwwwww..... owwwwwwww..."
