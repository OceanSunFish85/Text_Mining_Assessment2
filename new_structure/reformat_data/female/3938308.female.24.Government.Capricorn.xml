      I'm not trying to minimize what happened off the coast of Gloucester in 1991, but I think my friends and I experienced a close match this weekend on Lake Travis. The day started like any other lake day. We piled in the car with the sun shining and headed out around 4 or so. We were on the lake, in a cove, and skiing/kneeboarding folks within the hour. With the exception of the occastional passing cloud, the weather was beautiful. A couple of hours (and a few beers) later, we noticed a very dark cloud forming to the east of us but it appeared to be moving fairly quickly toward the center of town and away from the safety of our little cove. We decided it would be smarter to start heading back to the dock (a good 15/20 minute boat drive at full speed), but to be on the safe side I called the marina and it turned out that they were gettingnailed with winds strong enough to pull white caps over the dock and against the doors to the ship store. So, Plan B, we decided to ride it out where we were and hope that the worst part of it missed us entirely. Right about then was when we looked up and noticed that out of nowhere a second storm had formed directly above our heads. About 200 yards away you could see where the bottom had dropped out and it was heading our direction. If any of you have ever driven a boat in the rain, you know that as it comes down it feels like a hundred thousand needles poking you at once. We decided to try and find shelter at someones boat dock, at this point it didn't matter who's; we figured it would be easy enough to explain why we were on private property if the owners wanted to make a big deal out of it. We parked next to this boathouse/shed and tied off just as the worst storm I've seen on the lake in four or five years hit us. We emptied the boat and huddled together in the shed while we watched the storm come down. It was only then that I took a good look at our surroundings...A large "Private Property, No Trespassing" sign hung on the dock and inside the shed was written on a large erase board "Sherrif's Number". Whoever lived here obviously had a problem with unwanted visitors. Glancing up the hill I didn't see any house but a pathway leading back to a forest. (Here is where you cue "Dueling Banjo's"). Anyway, long story short, no owner ever showed up, the storm ended up dying down enough for us to head back to the marina (at about 4 miles per hour), and we all made it back to town in one piece, but I haven't had that sort of lake experience before and would prefer (even though it was a hell of an adventure), not to have it again. At least we timed it right... we got back to the dock with one beer left. Could've been   a lot   worse.

      Monday night I went over to Alex's brother's house to plan their drive up to Vermont for Phish. He has a really cool iguana. I only mention this because I owned two iguana's in my "weird pet stage", Iggy and Ziggy, both of which only lasted about three weeks. Jason's iguana is fully grown and actually does stuff like crawl around her cage, jump from wall to wall, and let you pet her. Mine were never that cool. They usually just layed around on their heat rock and then died. My iguana phase was inbetween my rat phase and my ferret phase. Yes, I owned rats once. Several, actually. My sister and I bred them. That is, until my little brother decided to get a ball python. Apparently ball pythons and rat babies are  not  a good combination. After the rats and iguanas came Houdini, my ferret. Houdini was fun in the beginning. Then, as anyone in my family can tell you, Houdini became the epitome of repugnance. He broke his leg or something and couldn't walk correctly anymore and then kind of just layed around in his own fecal matter. If you're not about to vomit right now, add the smell of his scent glands in and, well, you get the picture. Anyway, giving Houdini away was one of my more laudable decisions. After that, I stuck to normal, domesticated animals. Well, as normal as kittens found in the school gutter can be. Seriously, it must be me. I attract unconventional pets. Just look at my golden retriever, Rusty. The dog is insane. He does entertain me though, and if you can't be entertained by your pets, what good are they really? I think I'm going to stick to dogs for awhile, although I have always wanted an orangutan...

      If there are a ton of typos in this entry, I apologize in advance. I'm working on about two and a half hours of sleep. This weekend was fun. Up until last night, anyway. Friday I got everything straightened out with Alex's friend and we're cool now. Saturday night I met up with my old roommate Jonathon and his two brothers at Beerland on 7th and listened to this absolutely horrible band that I payed five bucks to go see. It wasn't my idea. After that, Alex and I went over to a friend of his house where we stayed way too late debating politics (for some reason Fahrenheit 911 has gotten people with absolutely no political interest or background talking like they give a shit about this election). It's incredibly frustrating having a controversial conversation with someone and then, after you've made an incredible argument on one side, have them say something assanine like, "Well, Bush is from Texas, so we have to like him."  What?  Did you honestly just say that? I mean, I can't believe that I wasted a single thought on your opinion. There's a good two or three minutes that I'll never get back... Anyway, last night Alex was going to come over and watch a couple of movies when he got off work. He called and asked if he could bring his dog with him. He used to do this every now and then until I asked him to stop because my dog and his, when they get together, play  constantly. They biteand growl, having a grand ole time, all in my living room. So he promised that he would put his dog in the car when it was time to go to sleep. For all you people who are about to freak out (he left his dog in the car ALL NIGHT?!?), she loves it. She actually prefers it. Beside the point, at about 4 am she started banging on my front door. The dog is a damn Houdini. She can get out of his back yard, back door, and now, apparently, his car. So we let her back in where she and Rusty continued to play for the next hour, keeping me up the entire time. Finally, Alex threw them both outside in the backyard but Rusty can only stay out there for so long before he starts yelping like a little girl and I have to let them both back in. Needless to say, it was a LONG night and I was NOT in a very good mood this morning. I'm waiting for someone to cross my path. I think sleep deprivation could be used as a viable defense in a murder trial. I'll let you know tomorrow if everyone survived.

      Last night I had a dress rehearsal for my August trip to Coventry in Vermont to see the final Phish show. I have never seen Phish in person. Truly, I'd never really heard Phish until I started dating Alex. There was a Phish cover band playing at The Vibe on 6th Street and they were absolutely awesome. Not that I have a lot to compare it to, but Alex and his brother Jason (who know every single strum of the guitar, drum beat, and keyboard stroke of the real deal) said that they were dead on. I don't think I've hadso much exercise in months, the dancing was out of control. I'm not really sure how I'm going to do it for three days straight, but, I'm a trooper. It'll be great. I can, however, see how Phish gets the reputation of being a band you have to be in an "altered state" to appreciate. The "clientele" is definately a bunch of Gen Y hippies (I saw one huge guy in a full length skirt), but all of whomseem to besome of the nicest people I've ever run into at a bar in Austin. Everybody's just out for a good time. Before all the hoopla that was yesterday evening, I was in a shitty mood because my boyfriends best friend (and roommate)made some comments to him about me that kinda hurt my feelings. Basically, Alex and I got into a heated argument about the Austin toll road issue in the car on the way to the lake and I ended up telling him to shut up and listen to me three times. I know, not nice, but you have to understand, this issue has been eating up our office (I had over 60 calls alone on Monday and approximately 30 on Tuesday). Needless to say, I was not in the mood to calmly discuss the situation. After about ten minutes of arguing, Alex and I looked at each other, he said he was going to raise the white flag, and we dropped the conversation. The next five hours were spent on the lake, drinkin', talkin', and floatin'. Apparently the debate bothered his roommate because the next day he asked Alex if he was okay with me treating him that way and that he's seen relationships like ours before and that fighting like that isn't healthy. Now, let me tell you from experience, I  know  what an unhealthy relationship is like. Mine is not one. In fact, I can't tell you how unbelieveably perfect Alex and I are for each other. But hearing that from your best friend does put you in a kind of funk and Alex had to talk to me about it, at which time I got upset that his friend was sticking his nose where it didn't belong. Anyway, long story short, I tried to say hello to his roomie last night at the show and he didn't really say anything back. Kinda makes me sad because he and I had a really good friendship before all this and I hopeour relationship isnot a lost cause. For those wondering, everything is incredible with Alex and me. I've never been so happy.

      Some of you have read me before, others, maybe not, but either way, here's the story of my blog...  In the beginning, my best friend Wendy and I created a blog for a book we were following called This Book Will Change Your Life.  It was a lot of fun for awhile and I certainly enjoyed my new creative outlet.  However, the Texas Leg was called back into special session and we actually had work to do around here, so the blog and book fell by the wayside.  We tried to pick it up again after session ended but it was a lost cause.  The tasks became mundane and writing about them seemed more like a chore than something I was looking forward to.  I do miss writing though.  It's something I've always had a passion for.  So, I decided to make my own blog.  This one will be more of my rants on life, love, politics, and stuff that pisses me off or thrills me...  pretty much whatever I feel like talking about at any given moment.  I will try to make it interesting for you, the reader, and the only thing I ask is that you not be judgemental (or, you can be, just don't tell me about it).  If you don't like what you're reading, don't come back.  I'm not going to edit my thoughts and "play nice" just because I know you might be reading along.  Anyway, that's the gist of it.  Please comment and keep reading, I'll be updating as often as I can.

      It's been a busy couple of weeks around the office. Notice that I said "around" the office and not "in" the office... That's because I truly haven't been at my desk all  that  often. My boss picked up and took his annual family trip to Minnesota where he has dial-up email and spotty phone service. In other words, he can't really reach the office, which in turn, basically gives us paid vacation. Now, we're not horrible employees, we had  someone  in the office everyday from 9-4; just not all three of us. Mostly, Wendy and I switched off and she took the morning shift and I'd come in around lunchtime (she's a morning person and I am   definitely   not). One afternoon we did both take off and the two of us and her significant other floated the Guadalupe all day. It was a blast. Then I took off last Friday as well because my youngest brother Alex was coming in town with his friend Graham to stay for the weekend and I needed to take them down to Texas State to check out the campus. Oh to be 17 again where your biggest thrill in life is realizing that in a year there won't be someone in the other room telling you whether or not you can open a beer or what time to go to bed. Though someone  should  tell you the latter when you start walking around shirtless after trading licks with your older brother. Saturday night I suggested that they not start drinking until much later so that they could party with everyone else instead of passing out before the party really got started. I had to hammer home the whole "your parents aren't here, you don't have to get sloshed by midnight" thing. So night three they started drinking at 12:30 am when we got out of  The Village . Course this time they were still up when I went to bed at 5:30 am. Sometime in the next year I'm sure they'll find a happy medium. The kids honestly did great down here, stayed out of trouble and caused me virtually no worries. So this morning was the last day I got to sleep in and tomorrow the boss is back and it's a return to routine around here. Damn.  On another note, if any of you have seen  The Village , let me know what you thought. I don't want to ruin anything here for any of you who haven't seen it, but I was expecting to be a little more scared than I was. Sure, I jumped and screamed a couple of four letter words, but the previews made it look like it was the next  Exorcist . It was not. Thumbs sideways for M. Night Shamalan's new flick.  Oh, and I changed the preferences, you can now post comments without signing up so no more excuses!
