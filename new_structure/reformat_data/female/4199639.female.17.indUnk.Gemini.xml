      the old cop that lives next door officially scares the crap out of me.  - he mows his lawn EVERYday at 8am.  - two weeks ago he started playing really loud music. it was like old 60's music.  - today he woke me up because of his extremely loud and depressing opra music.  - he's always in the garage. with his loud music. and he's weird. and he scares me. anyways. i found out some bad news. i can't go to san diego anymore because we don't have enough money. so my mom is just going to her conference and coming home. i was SO excited!! i want to cry. but then my dad called this morning -random because he never talks to me- and said 'want to go to the carribbean with me next january or february for a week?'. and i can bring a friend. YAY.  then i went to the bank. and while i was backing up - i dented the car. woo hoo. go me. i suck.  have a nice day.

      so lets see...  today i woke up, had breakfast, showered, went outside and tanned for a bit... then i decided to call the buckle back since they called me while i was gone. mike -the manager- wanted to schedual an interview, i said i was free for the next two days. so he said ok, see you at 2:00. it was 1:00 at the time, and i looked all crappy from being outside tanning, and i was freaking out because i was not prepared. i have never been to a job interview before. i couldn't find any good shirts to wear because i haven't done my laundry in like 5 thousand years. ugh, anyways i made it there ten minutes early, he said that was good of me. then we walked over to a bench right outside boston store to hold my interview. it was awkward. i thought we'd at least be alone in the back room of the store or something. but no. so...i had like a hundred brain farts and coudln't think at all. he kept asking me questions and i kept saying 'um...'. it seemed to be going pretty not so ok. then he asked me who's style i looked up to, who i admired for their clothing. then it got worse. because i couldn't think of one human on the face of the earth. i ended up saying kate hudson after like ten minutes. god i must have looked like such a retard. but i just couldn't think! but ah, i must be way too hard on myself. because at the end of the interview he said he liked me alot, but the only thing he was hesistant about was that i come off as being a little shy. UGH me and my shyness. it never goes away. anyway, he schedualed a second interview with me on sunday at noon. so thats a good sign. i have a feeling i will get the job. he was cool. the job sounds fun. i like the clothes there. AND i get 40% off everything. hah, yesss. 40% off Lucky jeans is great. yay.  anyways, i'm sure that little story bored you to death, if you even read the whole thing. hm...i have some nasty tan lines from camp. i have to work on those tomorrow. i hope its sunny.  i'm going to san diego in september and i am so so so so so excited. i can't stop thinking about it. i'm also excited to go to chicago on friday. but hm.   so my mom wants me to consider the university of arizona -tuscon-. i could go there and pay resident price because kevins sister lives there or something, and i'd use her address? lol...i dunno. that'd be pretty cool. they have a dance team, and its a good art school i hear.   i need to see guster in concert again. soon. i have a craving to see them. like right now.  ...well i got nothin else. </post></Blog>
