       I have wanted to do the  urlLink  Race For Life   in aid of Cancer Research for the last few years, two years ago I couldn't find anyone that would do it with me, and then this year I didn't think about it until too late, and didn't have enough time to get fit. So I have now found a willing friend and am in training. I know its a year away, but I would really like to have a good crack at running the whole way rather than walking. This is not to take away from the many people that do walk it, its all for a good cause but this is my personal goal.      As you know I am also trying to loose weight also, so this goal will certainly help me along the way.

       Today started off well, apart from the fact that I was late getting up, and had to go to the cop shop before work (doubley late) to hand in my slip for having a defect on my car, which was a day late. I hope they let me off.        Anyway, I started with breakfast as normal my favourite Crunchy Nut Clusters, the only thing that can truly fill me up until lunch time.        What a drag, by lunch time it already felt like I'd been at work for longer than I had. Wasn't really hungry, but felt like I had to eat, so off I toddle to the kitchen to nuke the soup. In comes the man 'something smells good. You couldn't knock us up a bacon sarnie when your done' (orrf, orff, orff). Every day is the same, never changes. 'I'll see what I can do' I reply.        Feeling peckish after sitting on my back side for so long, amazing what tapping away at a keyboard does to your stomach, I reach for the Thai Bites. Now I'm not sure if these are good or bad snacks, they are less fat than crisps I think so this is a good start.        Went shopping after leaving work 1/4 hour early. After doing so well and bypassing the almost mandatory sticky toffee cheesecake, I fail at the last hurdle and snaffle two, yes two packs of Rolo biscuits in my trolley. I take a mental note of where I have packed these, so I can eat one whilst I'm driving home.        God how did that happen, all six Rolo biscuits have gone. I quickly check the packaging and am very upset to find that each little biscuit has 115 calories.        Get home and unpack, and come to write a post. Does anyone else feel obliged to eat an evening meal when your partner comes home hungry and tired. We'll it just good manners. I polish off a pack of ravioli type fresh pasta with meat and cheese in it.       Food List for today:   1 x bowl of Crunchie Nut Cornflakes(with semi skimmed milk and canderel sugar)   1 x bowl of Ministroni soup   1 x small pack of Thai Bites   6 x Rolo Biscuits   1 x pack of raviolli    Tommorrow will be a better day!!

        I was recently weighed bythe Occupational HealthNurse at work. I was told that I am bordering ideal weight range according to my BMI (Body Mass Index) .Being 10stone 7lbs andonly 5'3" I guess this is not good. Ihave come to the conclusion that I have become what I have always dreaded...I amplump.        Just for good measure, mainly due to my love of food in general, especially Chinese, I have put on a few extra pounds, so I am probably now into the red zone of the chart.      I blame my plumpness on yo-yo dieting. Each time I diet (the last one I did was apparently not a diet, more of a healthy eating plan) I end up notat what I like to call the 'Sod It' stage after a few months. After this things are down hill, and a bit, and yes, I end up weighing more than I did before I started.        I got a new job 7 months ago, whichinvolves me sitting on my arse in front of a computer for almost 7 hours each day, apart from the odd meeting, where I will walk from one end of the building to the other, then sit on my arse again. Is it possible to get deep vein thrombosis from working in this way. I hope not, but I know that it is adamn good way of putting on a dress size. I am now a good size 14. This doesn't help my cause.      Reality hit a few days ago, when I realized that my beloved halter neck tops were beginning to look a little naff due to this extra weight I am harboring. Having just watched You Are What You Eat on TV, and seeing a bloke with a really swollen and bruised stomach, I decided to stop holding my stomach in and take a good look in the mirror.    Well. That wasn't a good idea. What I saw staring back was man from the TV program's belly, someone had done a transplant over night and I hadn't even noticed...arrrrrggghhh. Are women really supposed to have beer bellies hanging over there trousers?    That was the point. Immediately I donned the old sweat pants and went for a run. After getting a few yards down the road I was well and truly panting, but determined to at least get around the block I walked for a while, then jogged back (which is down hill luckily).     Feeling please with myself when I eventually got home, sweating and with a face  red  as a baboons back end, I decided that I deserved a treat and ordered a Chinese. Some habits just die hard.
