       1. My favorite new slang word for "doin it": French Omelette.  It's an omelette with meat inside.  AN OMELETTE WITH MEAT INSIDE!  2.  If I were to have a band, I would name it "Post No Bills", just to stick it to the man.  Or "Uterine Lining".  3.  My Pret A Manger lunchbag has a slogan on the side: "This Bag Has Enjoyed A Previous Life!"  As what?  Another bag?  That doesn't sound very enjoyable.  Although I have been entertaining thoughts of my bag having been a very flamboyant Courtier in 18th Century France.  urlLink

       I'll make this quick.  To Ball Park franks, the hot dog company that promotes their horse meat with a YUGE man saying the word "Girthy" over and over again, girthy girthy girthy, all the while drooling on himself and then closing this spectacle by taking big, meaty bite of your weiner:  Let me be frank.  I get seriously physically ill every time I see this.  A quick Google search:   urlLink  Apparently I'm not alone.    To Centrum, and your new "CARB ASSIST" vitamin.  During your commercial, you twist the bottle around dramatically to reveal the title.  For about 2 solid seconds, I thought you had a new product called "CARB ASS".  And while I would be in your prime demographic for said product, I really don't appreciate being spoken to that way, by you, by your family, by all of your friends.  I see the way they look at me, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  Now get out!

        urlLink Fans, you asked for it, you have it.   As reported previously, Mary-Kate Olsen has been sent to rehab for her voracious cocaine appetite.  What follows are some gift ideas to send to MKO in her time of need.   urlLink      1.   urlLink Tissue Box Cover   Lilting and feminine, she'll think of you every time she reaches for an Egyptian Cotton disposable hanky.  Every recovering coke head's first choice. (trust me.) ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      2.   urlLink Skip It   A.k.a. "The Ball and Chain of My Childhood", this is the perfect sport to keep those with "the shakes" occupied and happy for hours.  Now, when she's "hopped up", it'll have a  totally  different meaning.  And I'm sure she'd appreciate that. ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      3.   urlLink Vazline   Keeps those nostrils moist, not to mention those teeth gleaming for lurking, blood-hungry paparazzi. ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      4.   urlLink The Taboo Broadway Soundtrack   Because nothing says "Put Down The Fucking Coke" better than a shitty Broadway musical about Boy George and drug addiction.

        urlLink     As most of you know, American's beloved doppleganger, Mary-Kate Olsen,  urlLink recently checked into a hospital  for what my sources have confirmed is an eating disorder.  This sexy-rexy may be a billionairess, but she is still going to need some cheering up.  Below are some suggestions that might make this little anorexic who has everything feel a notch or two better.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  1.   urlLink 6-Ply Cashmere Turtleneck   If there's one thing this little stick-bug is gonna need inside that dreary hospital, it's the warmest sweater money can buy.  Watch as she pulls the sleeves over her hands while cupping a hot water with lemon.  She may be sick, but she looks damn good! ---------------------------------------------------------------   urlLink      2.   urlLink 18K Gold "Hang In There" Necklace   Here's the perfect way to let Mary-Kate know "Hey! You'll pull through this!  Just HANG IN THERE!  Don't die on us, ok?" ---------------------------------------------------------------   urlLink      3.   urlLink Butter   To ensure her survival.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      urlLink  4.  Gorgeous Thick Human Hair    No nourishment = major hairloss.  Skip out on that  urlLink bedazzled doo rag  and opt instead for this luscious wig, perfect for those glamorous Hollywood outings and group therapy sessions.     UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE**             urlLink It's cocaine.   It's not an eating disorder, she's in rehab for a rabid cocaine addiction.    Instead of tossing the above list to the wind, apply it to a friend or loved one who is undoubtedly riddled with self-hate.  And stay tuned for an updated guide...

        urlLink     Ladies, are you tired of meeting too many men, and then never knowing which ones ones are keepers and which ones are goners?  Try this handy little guide from the "Glamour Magazine" of the Florida Panhandle, the Pensacola News.  In Dee Dee Ritchie's Pulitzer Prize winning article,  urlLink  "Judging a Man by His Cassarole"  , Dee Dee explains the ins and outs of your man's culinary dabblings.  Of Tuna Casserole:  Do I really even want a man who likes tuna casserole? As much as I love tuna, of the sea rather than of the can, I cannot gag down a bite of this dish. If a man eats your tuna casserole, it must be love because his taste buds are dead. It's a great litmus test.   I once made the mistake of judging my man by how long it took him to shower.  Over 10 minutes meant that he was obsessed with his body and himself, versus paying attention to me, talking to me, bathing me, combing my hair, telling me how nice I look, etc.  If the shower was over 10 minutes - he was OUT THE DOOR!  In the end, I had a very meaningful relationship with a man who I knew cared for me, but his body fungus had me saying "Smell Ya Later!"

        urlLink     As I'm sure most of you now know, right now, in America, three babies are named ESPN (pronounced Espen).  One couple even plans on naming their second child ESPN 2 (pronounced, I believe, as Espen Douche).    As a result, ESPN plans on filming a documentary about these tykes, because if there's one thing ESPN fans love, its watching semi-retarded parents clean a dirty diaper.  The more I think about it, the more I like the idea.  Yeah, that's it, naming my baby after things I'm a fan of!    My first child will be called "Babaganoush", followed by "Snackwells", "Camel Ultra Lights", and my beautiful little girl, "Abortion."    Seriously, though, I will be happy to name my child "CBS".  All it's gonna take is for Les Moonves to drop that slut  urlLink Julie Chen , pick up a phone, and make it happen.    urlLink  Couple Names Son ESPN

        urlLink     America is in desperate need of a funny fat woman.  Roseanne Barr (big fan) is passe,  urlLink Rosie O'Donnell  is obviously the worst (not counting  urlLink Another Stakeout , which is primarily funny thanks to the genius comic stylings of Dreyfus/Ethtebeth), and  urlLink Mama Cass , while never necessarily a comedienne, is most definitely dead.  Then it occurred to me... Whatever happened to  urlLink Edie McClurg ?    Edie McClurg was an icon, one of many faces that has faded post-1989 ( urlLink Rick Moranis  on Line 2).  And why?  McClurg's brand of humor was unique, from syrupy sweet southern charm to a two-faced bitch on wheels.  From Grace, the plucky secretary in  urlLink Ferris Bueller's Day Off , to Bonnie Brindle, on  urlLink Small Wonder , to the annoying yet loveable Patty Poole on  urlLink "Valerie"  cum  urlLink "The Hogan Family" .    And how is Hollywood using this genius?  In straight-to-video thrillers such as  urlLink To Kill a Mockumentary  and the 2003 sleeper bomb  urlLink Fish Without A Bicycle  (which I hear is almost as good as  urlLink Goddamn, Parrot, That's A Sweet Ride! )  Well, I, for one, am appalled.  From hereforth hencewith, I propose banding together to form the "I Needie More Edie" Campaign.  I'll be the President.  The t-shirts alone will clearly be snatched up by Urban Outfitters, and my talk show circuit run would be ginormous (Can anyone say  urlLink Livin It Up with Ali and Jack ? I can.)  Who's with me?

        urlLink     Brace yourselves.  It's gonna be a  long  week.  An Iranian woman claims that she has given birth to a frog, reports newspapers in Iran.  Doctors speculate that the woman may have been impregnated whilst swimming in a dirty pool in Iranshahr, in Southeastern Iran.  I bet the Club Med there is  really  suffering.  Apparently, though, this woman isn't alone.  The BBC reports that in the long and rich history of amphibian-human impregnations:  One of the most famous was the 17th Century case of Catharina Geisslerin, known as "the toad-vomiting woman" of Germany.     And I thought that time I harfed up a live baby chick was bad!  It was definitely cuter.  I would LOVE to see this couple on Judge Joe Brown, or any other inane daytime Court drama:    "Ya Honor, his baby is 3 years old.  He does not pro-vide for me.  He was never there for his son!"    Cut to:  The other podium, where a live frog sits, defenseless and silent.  "I mean, look at him!  He cannot even hold. a. job.  And he's bad in bed!  Worthless, Ya Honor.  WORTH. LESS."

        urlLink     While working at a sporting goods store in Johnson City, NY, a 23-year-old man found a spider, doused it in lighter fluid and threw a match at it, in an attempt to kill it.  The fire quickly spread to the surrounding merchandise, and burnt half the store down.  No word on how the spider is recovering.  I totally hear this guy's pain.  I am psychotic about bugs!  (play a clip of Country John from the Real World SF singing "True Story!")  One time, I killed a small spider in my bathroom, first by dousing it in perfume (thanks for nothing, Dolce and/or Gabbana), then by unloading half a bottle of hairspray on it and freezing it to death.  Then there was the time I killed a roach using bug spray, and airlifted it to my toilet using double-sided tape stuck to the bottom of a small grocery bag, a la  urlLink Jamie Lee Curtis'  helicopter stunt in True Lies.   urlLink  Worker Trying to Kill Spider Starts Fire

"Please thank the bank," he said, smiling. "I couldn't have stalked without them."   He calls tennis "the game of kings."   "It is a graceful game that reveals the personality of the players," he said. "Serena is a dancer. She is the ballerina of tennis."   He said he fell in love with her two summers ago when he first saw her playing on TV. "She has this perfect tuft of hair. I had to watch her in person," he said.

Not yet 5, he can hold seven-pound weights with arms extended, something many adults cannot do. He has muscles twice the size of other kids his age and half their body fat. DNA testing showed why: The boy has a genetic mutation that boosts muscle growth.   Something tells me this kid would kick Tobey Maguire's ass in an alley fight.  Now that I think of it, I'm guessing an average 5-year-old would kick Tobes' ass.  Poor Tobey.  Poor, weak, lisping Tobey.

What is perhaps the craziest is this little optical illusion, which I have posted above.  For starters, this is obviously a  very   loose interpretation of what Jesus looks like.  It's more like the result of a sweaty night of passion between Vincent Gallo and Skeletor.  Back to the magic of optics.  Freddy instructs:  Concentrate on the four little dots in the middle of the picture for about 30 seconds. Then close your eyes and tilt your head back.  Keep them closed...you will see a circle of light.  Continue looking at the circle...  WHAT DO U SEE?  Wait... Wait a minute... Gasp! There it is!

       A boat carrying 42 African migrants accidentally wound up on the shore of a nude beach in Spain this past Monday.  Telemundo was there to catch all the action, as the exposed bathers approached the heavily clothed Africans to see if they needed help.    One thing that caught my eye was this paragraph, just thrown into the article with no apparent explanation:  The migrants included four babies, including one just 11 days old. A group of bathers was shown gathered around one of the infants, gently counting the fingers on one of its hands and coming up with six.   A six fingered baby!  I used to have a history teacher armed with a sixth toe, which she would proudly model for us in a pair of 80 year old Aerosole sandals, the same color as her pasty, blue-lined foot.  Looking back, it was probably just an overgrown bunyon, but at the time, this sixth toe was all I had to focus on during painfully dry lessons of Western Expansion (to this day, my least favorite part of American History.)    But a sixth finger!   Think of all you could do!  You could play a 12 string guitar with ease...  Or type 200 words per minute!  You could frighten little children away, but then win back their affection by inviting them into your car for some free candy!

Locals have been keeping their eyes and bananas peeled in the hopes of catching one lunatic in Berlin.    A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin, performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods, police said Friday...  The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a young couple out of the woods.  This seems like just the type of enforcement we need here in New York.  Imagine how nice Central Park would be without all of those performance artists and  elderly   people.

        urlLink      I happened upon this movie a few years ago, during an early morning viewing on Cinemax.  And what a goddamn treat.  John Travolta must live in a bubble.  And by "bubble", I refer to the plastic shower curtain lazily hung in the middle of his parents' living room.  Note how the "bubble" also has a huge open doorway, with a tiny fan blowing out the "germs."  How do we know there's a fan?  There are three pastel ribbons barely blowing out of the doorway, proving said airflow.  Also, Travolta spends the entire movie in a wifebeater and retro basketball shorts, because "ees really haht in dis bubb-le."  You don't know the half of it, Johnny!   WARNING: SPOILERS!  At one point, Travolta has a great idea - a portable bubble!  He maps out a diagram on some lined construction paper with a huge black crayon:  It's a stick figure, in a space suit, with a huge box strapped to its back, and a helpful arrow labelling it as a "Battery Pack."    Cut to:  The end of the movie where Travolta graduates wearing a 6 foot long oven mitt/lobster costume, and a smart looking mortarboard.    An interesting fact about this movie:  The woman playing Travolta's mother,  urlLink  Diana Hyland ,  was actually his lover in real life for many years.  She past away from cancer when J.T. was still in his prime.    On a serious note:  I would suggest watching this movie on mute for the first time.  The dialogue is genius, but watching these antics with no sound.... there are no words.  Also, the DVD is only $5.99 at Best Buy!!  (Possibly because the disc is made of matzah and recycled pickle jars.)   urlLink  The Boy in the Plastic Bubble

        urlLink       It's a long story, but something I saw on TV last night had me Googling "Presidential Pets" this morning.  And that's when I discovered the fascinating world of Presidential Pet Names and Breeds.  For example, did you know that   urlLink Teddy Roosevelt   had a pet guinea pig named "Father O'Grady"?  And while he wasn't toussling about with his wife's spaniel, Emily Spinach, he was probably out playing with his lion, hyena, wildcat, coyote, five bears, two parrots, zebra, barn owl, snakes, lizards, rats, roosters, and raccoon, to name a slew.  Believe it or not, unknown President   urlLink Rutherford Hayes   ended up making a difference in America -- by bringing over the first pair of Siamese Cats.  It would be only a few years later when his beloved Chinese kittens would play joke, and put pee-pee in his coke.  Loner  urlLink  James Buchanan   wasn't fucking around either:  when he wasn't vetoing a bill or causing a Civil War, he could be seen cuddling with his herd of elephants from the King of Siam and playing frisbee with his Bald Eagles.

She's already started a website,  urlLink Kids For Kerry , which aims at taking money pre-teens normally use for pornagraphy, drugs and abortions and applying it to a better cause - helping John Kerry get to the White House (Amen).    Her hard work has paid off.   urlLink  Ilana was asked to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Boston this week  , and brought the crowd to their feet.  On Dick Cheney:  When our vice president had a disagreement with a Democratic senator, he used a really bad word.  If I said that word, I would be put in a timeout. I think he should be put in a timeout.  BOOYA!  In your face, Dick!  Put that mutha-fucka in a time-muthafuckin-OUT!  I am standing on my feet and clapping as I write this.  What's in store for Ilana's future?  After growing out of her "awkward phase", she'll wait around for approx. 10 years to find a man that likes her for "her brains."  She'll sleep on a mattress made of money, and will undoubtedly be more successful than me.  Sidenote:  Why isn't  urlLink  Jaleel White   running for Senate?  He could take   urlLink Obama   to school. Two times.  Front and Back Note:  Yes, I am fully aware the title makes no sense.  K My A.

        urlLink      Sorry about lack of postings today.  I'm extremely busy planning a three week trip to the French Riviera.  Did I say French Riviera?  I meant rehab.  I'm busy planning a trip to rehab.  Forever yours, Jay Kaye.

        urlLink     This morning brought on a grand discovery, a website called   urlLink Who's My Daddy  , where the famous lineage of many popular celebrities is exposed, thusby negating their so-called "talent" and allowing us to wallow in the pleasure of their  urlLink  undeserved fame  .  Well, I'm not one to brag, but if offering up my own celebrity lineage increases my chance at fame, then I guess I'm left with no other choice.  So here it is.  I am the child of   urlLink Julie Newmar   and  urlLink  Bootsy Collins  .  It's true.  Not many people are aware of their brief but fruitful romance.  I am all too aware.  Their fame cloaks me in a shadow of doubt:  Do I deserve this wealth?  This mansion, this champagne fountain, paid by three parts soul, one part funk and a couple of catwoman costumes?  Who are my real friends?  Do they like me for me, or are they just out for some of my Bootsy-licious fortune and fame?  Point being, if any of you casting directors or literary agents out there want to get your hands on some priceless pop-culture DNA, please contact me.

        urlLink     Believe it or not, there are some things  urlLink so tasteless  even I won't blog about them.    This item walked that very line, but like an obese man on a tightrope, lost its balance, and here it is.    Italy held their  urlLink  annual Ms. Chubby contest   this week, and crowned its winner with a tiara made from sausage links and Sno-Caps.  Giovanna Guidoni, weighing in at 416 pounds, literally took the cake, becoming 2004's official Miss Cicciona (which translates to "Uch, God.  No, Really, I Feel Sick.")  Fat jokes aside (of beef), did you know that there are forums online promoting anorexia?   urlLink  Pro-Ana sites   are springing up all over the net, instructing girls on how not to eat, what diets really keep your weight below 85 pounds, and listings for upcoming auditions.  Also of note,  urlLink this twig ,  urlLink this wall , and  urlLink flies fucking .  Somehow all more interesting than anorexics.

        urlLink     I was 30 minutes late to work this morning, thanks to some electrical problems at Chambers Street.  Subway Announcer:  The train is being held at the station.  I think:  Mmmm...  I bet it's nice being held at the station.   If anything in this city needs a little TLC, it's the subway.  A home/bathroom to many a gypsy and tramp, littered with garbage, hitting a person now and again... these things can be very traumatic for a train.  All it needs is to be held a little while.  But please.  Not on a Monday morning during rush hour.

        urlLink     I'm not sure if you guys were aware or not, but Sunday nights on Turner Classic Movies is Silent Sunday Cinema.  A friend of mine and I tuned in.  Maybe because the only other options were  urlLink  "The Abyss"   (love) and  urlLink  "All I Want For Christmas"   (LOVE!), both epics in their own right, but movies I know all too well.  The movie was called   urlLink "Safety Last"   (I chuckle as I type), starring the adorable antics of  urlLink  Harold Lloyd   as "The Boy" and some floozy as "The Floozy".  Most of you are probably aware of the famous picture of some old timey guy hanging off of a clock, a still taken from this movie.  Please, for all that is sacred, try your best to get a copy of this film.  I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard.  Some clips:  An officer named STUBBS, a drunk caught in a volleyball net, and physical comedy that makes Robert Benigni look like Al Gore! (a very wooden political figure, for those of you not aware.)     Perhaps the only cringe-enducing scenes involved overly racist stereotypes:  a Black servant who looked absolutely possessed, and a Jewish jewelery dealer whose greedy hand rubbing and blackened teeth made   urlLink The Passion of the Christ   look like  urlLink  Shoah  .  But for a movie made in 19-tickety-two, it didn't come as that big of a surprise.  For more info, check out this  urlLink  CNN article about Lloyd  , as well as a recent  urlLink  biography   written about him.

        urlLink     Those wacky Japanese are at it again!  This time, a clothing company has created knife-proof clothing to protect Japan's schoolchildren from the likes of blade-wielding day-glo vampires thirsty for that sweet salty-eye-brine, or something like that.  Those Japanese.  Are Pretty.  Wacky.   urlLink  Sign of the Times: Knife-Resistant Garb for Kids

       Let's start the morning off on the wrong foot, shall we?  It's raining outside, it's dreary, I've got a stool-load of work to do, and I'm pretty sure I'm out of tampons.  Bodily functions aside, my hair looks terrific.  And I'm covered in strange dog hair (I don't own a dog).  SO!  Rather than delve immediately into "funny" stories about dogs dressed like ambulance drivers and monkeys on rollerskates, let us warm our hearts instead.  First off, an ex-crack addict and homeles man has donated $10,000 to an art gallery.  After receiving a large inheritance from his deceased mother (which reminds me, I need to call Aaron Spelling to reschedule our "date"), the newly rich ex-convict wanted to express his gratitude to the gallery after they allowed him to sleep in their doorway, no doubt while gallery owners sold canvases covered in black and white shit-smears for hundreds of thousands of dollars.   urlLink  Ex-Crack Addict Gives $10K to Art Gallery    Also, a divorced American soldier fresh from the sandpits of Iraq has struck gold in the Assachusettes lottery, winning $200,000 a year for life.  He plans on spending the money on "his kids' college education and [all the whores and booze money can buy.]"**  **Actual quote: Getting himself out of bankruptcy, but c'mon, we all know what that's code for.   urlLink  Soldier Home From Iraq Strikes It Rich In Lottery    Finally, in keeping with the theme of "money", we have  urlLink  Zoot Money  , pictured below.  I don't know what this guy's famous for, but somethin' tells me it has a lot to do with baby-makin' music.   urlLink
