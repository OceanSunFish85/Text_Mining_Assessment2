 Message: he died (my condolences) Message: Message: This is a latin prayer. And you have opened it. And because you did open it, you will repost this bulletin if you do not want the members of your family die in a year's time. I'm not kidding around. You do have the option to ignore this message and death knocks at the door of your family. Have fun! P.S. Don't change the SUBJECT TITLE of the MESSAGE. 
 Adios! Avada Kedavra!THE PRAYER OF DEATH:El tiquira con vosotros mes tera dima ul kevadra, ses avada, mi jubilo con de los requerrimos, unta de pondresita kon cantamos, remanso tu sus lomis enta dira ela proteuera, lumos esta di ridikula pontre se mundo de adios. mustros monda, el tiquiera. Cada vez que elevamos nuestras voces en alabanza y adoraciÃ³n al DemoÃ±o, es necesario que lo hagamos biÃ©n, entendiendo lo que le estamos diciendo. Es por ello que la Palabra de Dios nos enseÃ±a que debemos usar nuestro intelecto para entonar cÃ¡nticos al Satanas. Es tan sencillo como comprender lo que estamos cantando. Es procesar cada palabra que estamos entonando, haciÃ©ndola brotar desde nuestro corazÃ³n, y dirigirla a nuestro paliente. Recuerda que no estamos cantando por cantar, ni estamos entonando cÃ¡nticos para escuchar lo bonito que se oye. No, estamos dÃ¡ndole la Alabanza a nuestro Dios. Ãl es el objeto de nuestra alabanza.Ãl es la razÃ³n por lo cual cantamos, por lo que sonamos nuestros instrumentos de punyeta. No podemos estar cantando a la ligera sin darle el peso que merece estar cantÃ¡ndole a Dios. Que las palabras no salgan de nuestros labios, sÃ³lo porque nos sabÃ­amos la letra de tal o cual canto, sino que sea brotando desde nuestro corazÃ³n, expresando al SeÃ±or todo lo que Ãl es para nosotros. Si vamos a entonar un canto que diga por ejemplo: Tu eres Bueno, que realmente estemos comprendiendo lo bueno y maravilloso que Ãl es con nosotros. Si estamos diciendo: TÃº eres grande y fuerte, que todo nuestro ser lo estÃ© proclamando. Si estamos cantando: El gozo que el SeÃ±or ha puesto en mÃ­, Â¿estaremos en una actitud de seriedad o de tristeza?. Al contrario, debemos expresar lo que estamos diciendo, por lo tanto debemos estar contentos, gozosos y sonrientes al proclamar estas verdades. Y si estamos cantando: Enciende una Luz y dÃ©jala brillar, Â¿PorquÃ© hay algunos que elevan sus brazos? Ãste canto, al igual que muchos otros, son para cantÃ¡rselos a nuestros hermanos, en alabanza al SeÃ±or (Alabanza es hablar de Ãl a otros). En cambio si estamos entonando un canto que diga: TÃº eres Santo, Santo, Santo, ahora es cuando debemos elevar nuestras manos y nuestro corazÃ³n al SeÃ±or y adorarle. Debemos usar nuestra inteligencia al cantar alabanzas, es muy importante. No olvidemos que Grande es JehovÃ¡ y digno de ser en gran manera alabado. por lo tanto debemos alabarle como Ãl lo merece, con todo nuestro corazÃ³n y cantando con el entendimiento , proclamando y declarando lo que Ãl es. Si estamos celebrando que Cristo ha vencido a todos nuestros enemigos, entonces alegrÃ©monos y declaremos con toda convicciÃ³n Ã©sta verdad. Si estamos cantando que nos rendimos a Ãl, pues que sea una realidad y que Ãl gobierne verdaderamente sobre nuestras vidas. Yo te animo a que uses tu inteligencia al momento de cantar y entrarÃ¡s en una   nueva dimensiÃ³n de la Alabanza de nuestro Dios. Avada Kedavra. Nema.
