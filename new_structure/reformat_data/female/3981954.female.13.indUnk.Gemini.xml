       Hey guys!!! Im sooo confused!!!! I like this guy and hes sooooooooooo hott!!!Grrrowl!! hehe! ButI havent talked to him in like forever but I still remember when we use to talk and stuff and I miss that!! My friend is suppose to tell him to IM me when he gets on the comp but Im not sure shes gonna!!! I dont want to tell my friend how I feel about him because shes really close to him and 1 she might tell him and I dont know if I want her to do that and 2 I dont feel like I can really talk to her about that kind of stuff cause I dont think she'll understand and I dk shes just not the kind of person u would talk to about ur love life I mean yea u can tell her ur going out with someone but u can really tell her that u still like someone or u miss someone or that u want tostart talking to ur ex again cause u kind of want to get back with him because if u do she'll probably just sit there and look at u like ur crazy or if ur on the phone or one the comp she'll just say something like ooooooooooook or somebodys lost it!!! At least all this is how I think she'll react but I dk cause sometime she act different and understand and stuff so I dk!!! Grrrrrrr why cant I just tell her how I feel and how she'll understand and not have to worry about it but noooooooooo I have to be to chicken to bring it up!!! What should I do guy?? Im so lost!!!     xoxoxoAsHlEexoxoxo

       I had a bad day today! ............... I found out that my grandpa might die soon! ...... Hes been sick for a looong time and I know it would probably just be best if he did but I dont wanna lose him cause hes still family and I love him .... He cant eat ne more he has to have his food through a tube thingy in his stomach (that he always takes out) and he can read and hes smart and stuff but he cant really pay attention or understand ne thing like he can talk to someone and have a conversaion he alwasy changes the subject every 5 minutes and he doesnt rememeber everyone and stuff like that and its horrible and my mom says that he might die soon and Im really mad (not just sad) about that because last year I had one person die in my family then after that her dad then her mom then my other grandma and Im scared that if one person dies again then a lot of people are gonna die I dont want another half of my family to leave me!!  I already feel alone in my house (another story)  and I dont want to feel even more lonely cause it really sucks!!  I know it may be best if he gos but then again in my mind it wouldnt!
