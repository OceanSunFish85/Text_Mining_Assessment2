      Wednesday.  Interesting day.  Half-through the week if one is a 9-5erâwhich I am right now.  Ugh.  Making the most of it thoughâ¦all the while wishing I were a downtown biker courier or something of the like.  I just want to be among the elements of the world rather than peering from a 17-floor window view of a 69-story building Downtown.  It makes very little sense to me why I ever even became an office workerâ¦I should have been a carpenter.  There is and are, however, more status and better benefits (Iâm just guessing on the benefits part)â¦than a carpenter.  I suppose I did take Jakob into consideration when I decided what his Mom would do for a living until he graduates from high school.  Eeewwwwâ¦what a terrible lesson that was for me to teach him.  I hope he doesnât heed THAT advice!  Well assuming, of course, that he would not enjoy an office job.  Hmmmâ¦which makes me wonderâ¦what kind of job will he WANT?  And will he do what he wants?  Or what I did, allow an exterior force to misshape and bend my very own perspectives and decisions of how I would earn money.   Earn money.  That is really what a job is to most people.  Letâs see here, what can I do to make enough money to pay my way in a world I have created for myself?  Thatâs a f*~ked up way to decide on stuff.    	I really just wish we could all do what we wanted for one day and â¦ you know, I think that pretty much everything would get doneâ¦the necessities anyway.  They are all that matters.  I have been doing a great deal of thinking about Burning Man.  I am very excited about my journey to the Man.  I have begun my journey, but I think I mentioned that in a former blog entryâ¦Anyway, I have begun my journey.  The journey of consciously living.  Being aware of what I feed my body and aware of what my body needs.  Not abusing it by giving it excess of what makes it unhealthy.  Very basic stuff that is so easily forgotten.  Ideally, Iâd like not to eat processed or pre-prepared foodsâsuch as restaurant or fast-foods.  I could still eat âoutâ it would just be from a friendâs kitchen rather than a business.  Neat, I could save money too (I think).  I need to save money.  Not for the same reasons other people need moneyâyou know, to buy things, Noâ¦.I need money for a pile.  All I need is a little pile of money.  And only because there are a few things in this world that you can only get with money.  Interesting.  I just thought of thatâ¦kind of led to that conclusion but whateverâ¦Iâll take it!   	I do surprise myself with my thoughts from time to time.  Its like a bonus for being meâ¦or having to hang out with me all day.  A little present from me to me.  Gracious everyday life is rather boringâthe people mostly.  I have been thinking a great deal of howâabout from the 7th gradeâpeople begin trying to be like âeveryoneâ elseâ¦or âthe normââ¦ or better than the âJonesesâ  Iâll sayâ¦And at great expenses to do so.  A spouse, a house, a car, a yard, one or more kids, petsâ¦toys for the kids, clothes, gifts, holidays, birthdaysâ¦.then they spend all their âweekend timeâ cleaning, mowing washing, running, buyingâ¦then back to the grindstone on Monday. It is a vicious cycleâjust like the violence-cycle or uni-cycleâ¦just kidding about the unicycle.  Just trying to lighten up my thoughts there.  I will elaborate on that theory laterâ¦.OHâ¦reason I was typing that is â¦. People begin in the 7th grade or so (usually) trying to be like âeach otherâ all the while losing themselvesâ¦until they realize what they did and begin looking for themselves againâ¦(middle age for most).   Gracious, most people never admit they lost themselves.  They just donât get it.

      I just spoke with My Jakob and was suddenly jolted into reality. Isn't it curious how Mom's can be going along seemingly in control and BAM! Sexcuse me Lady--YOUR SON IS GROWN!  No, what had happened was...actually, no joke.   I was talking to Jakob on the phone about âsummer vacationâ and stuff and I am not quite sure what he said but it occurred to me thatâ¦hello! Mom!...heâd rather be in Huffman with his friends and his truck and stuff than in Houston with none of that!  What I am feeling is just one of those little shifts in a relationship where one person grows and the other doesnât.  Iâm not supposed to grow that wayâ¦Iâm not supposed to realize that my baby boy is nearly a grown man!  I donât realize it because he will always be my baby and should be.    	I did write him an email telling him that I feel like he might be going through a growing stateâ¦namely the one where time with friends is simply more rewarding than time with your parent(s).  Iâm just glad he knows that I love him because if he didnât heâd be turning to them for thatâ¦what he is seeking now, as a teenager, is acceptance.  Itâs what is nearly the most important feeling of all as a teenagerâ¦.donât you remember?  Well if you donâtâ¦sorry but itâs true nonetheless.    	Anyway, I do wonder if my Mom realizes it.  She and Jakob are just so close.  He is her life in so many waysâ¦her breath some days.  I wonder if she knows that I know that?  She gave me a saying the other day to reproduce for her.  It states as follows:  âLife is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.â  She is such a cool Mom.  I havenât told her that lately but I believe I willâ¦soon.  I have a cute card at home I can write a nice message in.  	Iâm going to New Orleans this weekend with my sister, Tami.  We will stay with a friend, Kenny.  He is fun and very accommodating.  Heâs definitely the Hostess with the Mostest!  Iâll have to post some pictures when I return.  The Essence Fest is in New Orleans this weekend but I donât think weâll go.  I donât appreciate live music yetâ¦but someday hope to.  Andâ¦those days of paying some huge entry fee to get into a fenced off area full of people on a smoldering hot day where there is no shade and the beer cost six dollarsâor water for four.  Nope.  Not me.  Unless of course, I learn to appreciate the good, live music.  Anyway, our plan is go to go Biloxi for gambling or Gulfpoint, MS for the beaches.  Again, Iâll post pictures if I can.  	Well, I suppose that is enough since its early evening and I need to wrap up this stuff on my desk so I can come in the morning to a welcoming desk.  ]  	Perhaps Iâll feel like writing later.  	BTW: My Jakob is the best kid in the world!  If you wanna check him out, you can at http://www.jakobmetzger.com

      Great job on the commitment to NO alcohol.   I worked on Blinda's piece and its turning out greater than I anticipated.  I figure I can give myself this week (before Friday) to have it complete and ready to ship or take to her.    I have  had a lot of tea tonight and need a sleeping pill to counter the caffiene.   I already miss My Jakob and he just left yesterday.  Burning Man is my focus...and all the enchanting experiences that come with it.  Finally, finally.  Good night you...and fun dreams to ya.  â

      Well, that sucks.  I typed an entry and somehow exited without publishing it.  Eeerrrrr.  I was going over my day.  All the new stuff.  My blog, my first entry, first day with no alcohol and my first day to focus on my new self--not totally new, just different in a fun, good way.  I'm realizing I am much different than I once thought.  I feel like my life is fitting together.  My self.  My Jakob.  My Little Mary Sunshine.  My Woody, Stella and Dorothy.  OH...that reminds me, I bought the perfect shoes to wear when I ride Dorothy.  Red patton with a small heel.  Great for any weather.    I have decided to plan and work towards my first experience of Burning Man.  http://www.burningman.com  I am going this year and am very, very anxious.   I sure hope to have Stella ready for the trip.  She has been such a good van so far.  I can hardly wait to camp in her.    I made a great dish tonight.  Grilled chicken, cubed potatoes, frozen spinach, diced tomatoes, olive oil, onion, garlic, pepper and salt.  I call it my Greek-esque dish.  I need to wash my clothes tonight but I forgot to buy detergent at the grocery store.  I was trying so hard to stay focused and to get only what I need for the week and to not go manic....!   I did a great job.  With my strength, I was able to walk out of that store without purchasing a single case of anything that was on sale.  Ugh.  Mania at the grocery store is not o'kay.  And besides, I do think its the flourescent lights that cause it--the mania that is.  I am going to close...I have a piece to work on for my best friend's 10-year wedding anniversary.  It's going to be a favorite...I am certain.
