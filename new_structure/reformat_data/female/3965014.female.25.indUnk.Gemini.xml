      Salaams and Hello!!    Well, first of all, my name is Colleen. I created this blog just to vent, share some thoughts, ect. I just moved back home in Pennsylvania after spending a few years living in Dallas Texas. I am newly divorced (my divorced was official this past May). It does feel strange being divorced after being with someone for so long. But I know that in time, that will change. We were together for over 4 and a half years and I must say that it was quite a roller coaster. We still talk from time to time, but I am glad that he is still down there and not have to worry about running into him.    I am a converted Muslim. I have been converted since Feb 2001, but I feel like I have always been Muslim. People are so shocked when they find out about this. When they see me, they see this american girl with blue eyes and wearing jeans and t-shirts.Even my friends are even more shocked that I am stillMuslim after my divorced...like I converted for my ex husband. It reallygets under my skin sometimes that they think about this, but I don't really say anything.I don't wear hijab. Well, I did wear it full time awhile ago while I was in Dallas (there is a huge Muslim community there) and it was wonderful. I actually felt better andwas more of myself...I had this peacewhen I was wearing it. But it got to the point where i was harrassed a lot and decided for my safetyto take it off. I know its not a good excuse because there are women that were harrassed worse that I and still wear it today and never took it off. *sigh* Insha'Allah (God willing) one day i will wear it again. I do wear it to pray and to go to mosque. I miss going to mosque. The nearest one is about an hour away and I don't have the time anymore to travel there. Where I live in Pennsylvania, its very rural and ultra conservative. I am probably one of a handfull of Muslims living here. But although all of this, I am glad to be home and looking forward to starting my life all over again.    Well, I thought I would post about who I am. I also took this personality test about me and who I am looking for (yeah i know, i have too much time on my hands lol). I copied and pasted below...    I am a: 25 yr old woman  located in: Bradenville, Pennsylvania, United States  Looking for: 24 to 35-year old man  My ethnicity: White / Caucasian  Body type: Full-figured  Height: 5â 4 (162.6 cms)  Sense of humor: Clever: Nothingâs better than a quick-witted comeback, Dry / Sarcastic: I'm not bitter because I'm single. Quite the opposite  Sign: Gemini  About me and who I'd like tomeet   *****wackos and game players need not respond*****   Hi! My name is Colleen. I am 25 years old. I am not very good about talking about myself, but here it goes...After a few years of living in the south, I have just moved back home to Pennsylvania and ready to start meeting people. I guess you are wondering who I am looking for, right? Well, all in all, I am looking for I am looking for a nice guy. I bet you are wondering, well, that is easy enough ...lol you have no idea how tough that is (refer to the top). I am looking for someone to hang out and laugh with, can carry on a good conversation, and if he looks like George Clooney, it is a plus, but I will still talk to you if you don't *wink* lol...I hope to find someone that shares common interests (movies, music, books, opera, dining out, traveling, ect). Someone who likes to go out and have a good time, but could also be happy staying at home cuddling on the couch with take-out food and watching a movie...or a rainy afternoon spent at a book store with a good cup of coffee and talking about anything . If this sounds like you, and would like to contact me, i have the same scn name as another yakko place. Take care and hope to hear from you soon! GOODLUCK!!! Bye!
