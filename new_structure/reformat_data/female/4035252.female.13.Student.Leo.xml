      Oooooh, I've just discovered something! If you enchant a Pink Flamingo, and it actually works (Meaning it doesn't burst into flame), it can talk to cats! Sometimes it even talks to the unenchanted pink flamingos! When she talks to a cat, the cat sits upright, and talks in back in the voice used for children! Also, notice it's hand movements. Very cute!

      Now, I know what you're thinking. "Pfft. There are plenty of other Sims sights I could go to.." Right? Yeah, I thought so.  This site is for Sims fans out there who know things about the Sims games, and want to share them with the world, also, there are fun facts, tips, and cheat codes.  Now, how 'bout it?

        1. Who is more fake, Pamala Anderson or *YOU*  2. To eat, or not to eat..  3. What's the difference between polititians and toilets? Both are full of shit..  4. Is America just a giant lava lamp? Because they're both fun to look at, they're just not that bright.    5. Why is the word "fuck" a bad word? It's the most flexible word in the world! It can be part of a word, like "infuckincredible" or be instructive, like shutup and go fuck yourself. ^.^ It's just an innocent little word!    6. If Hilary Clinton was the First Lady back in 1996-2000, did that make Monica Lewinski second lady?    7. Why do people say,"Moneky see, monkey do."? The monkey had to see it to do it, didn't he dumbass?    8. If guys come from Mars, and girls come from Venus, where'd Micheal Jackson come from?      9. Why do people view Immigration as a good thing? It brought culture and all that, but it also brought SARS, AIDS, HIV, and many other STD's availible at your local dance club.    10. Why do people always go Christmas shopping after Thanksgiving nowadays? Back in the "good ol' days" Thanksgiving was Thanksgiving and Santa wasn't poking his fat jiggly ass in it.      Well, that's all for now folks. I'm a little busy these days. Just to show how busy I am, I had to write down a rough draft for the Bar Jokes section coming up while I was brushing my teeth!         urlLink

        Hello people of no-life-land. Wondering what this is? It's a blog. No, it's not my diary of which guy looks like Brad Pitt and what I think of Mr. and Mrs. Assholes next door. This is my handy dandy pixelized detention slip scrap paper journal in which I can entertain you with the 2-bit jokes from deep within the matrix of mind. This site is basically a comedy journal for me and my friend. People in the land of we-have-a-life fondly know us as Marissa and Candi... I mean Carissa and Mandi! Together... we will conquer.. and Become the president and Vice President of America!!! Er.. I mean we'll become friends of comedy who should get a job instead of sitting infront of my 1989 monitor thinking of witty things to make you people laugh. And looking at how stupid and utterly annoying the election of 2004 is looking it'd be best to pack-up, move to Canada, and get on your computer to laugh at the jokes here, because face it, you'll need the laughs, eh? Anyways, the kind of jokes me and oh great one will be posting here are things such as nutty pick-up lines, life's unanswered questions, bar-jokes, Questions of the Month, Why'd the chicken cross the road? Answers, Fake College/Highschool Exams, and the ever Popular things they should make into a bumper sticker. We won't have all of these categories up for a while, so please, bear with us! We actually do have a life, however tiny and goony it may be! We have things to do, like school! School's not important, but we either have to goto school now or face the fifth grade while we're playing bingo at the nursing home. And finally, without further Ado, I present to you... The Jokes and Gigs me and my friend are typing insanely to create! Laugh loads, have fun, and enjoy! Bon apetite!        -Notice-    We realize you probaly skipped a few thousand sentences. But even if you did.. READ THIS PUNK! Any copying of our jokes will result in a swift kick in your ass and the ridge marks of my boots in the turds you shit for the next 5 years. Thank you for your time!    -Barbara Streisland    (No, not really! It's me you idiot!)    _________________________________________________________________
