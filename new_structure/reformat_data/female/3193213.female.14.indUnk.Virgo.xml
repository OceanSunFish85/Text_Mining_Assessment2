          Time has really fly, In a blink of an eye.. It seems now we have to cry, As its time to say goodbyeâ¦  I know how it feels like deep down inside, I can tell from how you smileâ¦ I can tell that you heart is opposite of your smilesâ¦  This little things here, Are all stuffs Iâve not let you hear.. But this little things here, Are all that I want to tell your ears.. Please hold on to your tears, As Iâm afraid Iâm not hereâ¦  Thanks is part of my says, But cries will be all it takesâ¦  Youâre that little stars in my dreamsâ¦ Youâre that little shines that made me smileâ¦ Youâve done a lot I shall say, Youâve cured that little wounds that were still wet inside, And now it has partially driedâ¦  âThank You is too less for me to sayââ¦ But for how everything takes, These little poems are my show of gratitude to youâ¦  Sorry I shall say too, In times I may be too much than usualâ¦ I may have hurt you, But I didnât knowâ¦ I mightâ¦ But you kept quietâ¦ Your silence has brought me to a mystery, Which I hope I can find outâ¦   -Nisa-",

        You are all that Iâm left with, Donât leave me lying around in others arms, When youâre still around, And I can see youâ¦.       I find it hopeless,   To go high above... I find no way to feel that love, Cuzâ you seem to treat me like a stoveâ¦ I canât find replaces, As you are the only one that I seem to love...      Now that youâre gone, I thought life was easierâ¦ But I was wrong, Now that Iâm caught in a middle of twoâ¦ I feel so tight,  I feel like being someone newâ¦ It all happens because of you.    ^-Nisa-^",

Listenin to 2 finale songs For the Investiture...Missing them (seniors) .. well its part and parcel of life in the band... My batch takin over..New Majorss.. My heartous congratulations to 4! .. Feelin bery happi for them..Potential ones..To all others' who haf got a post..Congrats too! To those who didn't..Its okie..there'll be next year... I believe the band will move on to a better Band and not forgeting CCA in the school... My mind still reads the nite of the Investiture..i Still can't forget about it.. But one still questions me... Why did "chilli" cried?..Izzit bcuz' of the Grand Finale too "feeling" or izzit bcuz' we've created a poem which has hurt her?... I hope that it wasn't bcuz' of a phrase dat she cried..I hope its bcuz' of the 2 finales... That nite, though there were laughters..tissues still filled the room.... Well, who would not feel sad? when you've to part wit your seniors.. especially when u are really close to them.. You shared alot with them..Ure tears,ure anger,ure laughters..Almost everythin...(that goes for me too)...hmm..well.. wateva it is... we haf to carry on our duties that has been passed down to us.... and make..   ...HSSCB a better home for all members cold but yet warm...
