      How many of you would risk your life for the life of your best friendâs? Well, without trying to sound condescending to the life guard of Anyer Beach, they did a great job saving lives, huh. In fact, a college friend of mine died, at the age of 22, trying to save his best friendâs life in grave peril. His friendâs life was spared while his wasnât. Riza died from trying to save his best friend who was drowning. (Even in the course of battle, this selfless act is highly considered heroic, and the widows of whoever performs it will be granted a medal and a lifetime recognition). Now if you think this sounds impossible, try picturing his parentsâ face when they were told that their son had died from a very heroic act. Sad? Devastated? Disappointed? Angry? Try Proud. This nonsense probably has shadowed their faces when they buried their son. But the fact that their son, had in fact saved one life by giving his own, well, that counts for something.  Friends. Would you risk your life for theirs? Not everyone is like Riza. I know Iâm not. And no one is asking me to sacrifice my own life and hand it on silver platter to the one I love most dearly. But the fact that I almost lost my best friends made me realize just how precious friendship really is. Like gems, you have to grind it, cut it, hit it, and polish it, over and over again, until you have the perfect cut. Until it becomes priceless. In Kâs terms, you know you have a best friend when you can just feel comfortable just sit around, completely enjoy the silence, and not feel awkward about it.  K, unlike most of my other friends, she holds on to her friendship. No, she does not have all sorts of different kinds of friends for different kinds of activities. Instead, sheâs got 4 most dearest friends who stick with her through rain and dry, sadness and laughter. I, on the other hand, came later. We just met like 1.5 years ago, nothing compared to their 10 years friendship. I envy them. Itâs funny how the grass is always greener on the other side.  I personally have more close friends than I could possible imagine. Thereâs one oldest friend of mine who sticks by me since Elementary School. Ra and I now keep each other company from time to time, well, just until she got another job (after she got back from the States). And there are the 2 best friends that I see every Saturday mornings during my French class (Ri and L); we share a lot together. And thereâs also my office clique, (theyâre T, Rn, N, L, I, and J), I also kept friends with those who resigned like S and D. My high school friends; Nd from one clique, and thereâs also M, F, Su, Ay, and Rs from another clique. My college friends P, G, and Kn, Al and Bt. My TM friends F and Dn, and of course none other than my dear ex, A. I know I donât have that huge crowd surrounding me, but I know I keep them updated from time to time.  Quite a long list aye? But why do I envy K who only keeps them short, yet very close? And the saddest part is, I almost broke up the GB, the clique that K brought together. The one thing I learn from my experience, you can never please everyone. And trying so hard to please Ra and K, I almost hurt both of them, and certainly Kâs gang; R, B, Ku, and Dd.  How did I feel? Like an empty shell. Everyone who really matters, despite the fact that I met them very shortly, just seemed so far away that even I couldnât reach them.  Like Riza, I wish I could do a selfless act. If I could turn back time, Iâd rather not know K and her clique, so that perhaps they could still live in harmony. Turned out, itâs a one manâs opinion, for theyâre having a blast with my presence. And what now? Good thing K has a golden heart. She decided to forgive us all, for whatever happened last Friday. Things are patching up, and now, I can see the clear blue sky once again.  Would K and the boys save my life? No. They're nothing like Riza. Nope, they will not save your life and sacrifice their own. But they will stay on shore to put on a blanket over your shivering body. Through them, I could see true friendship in such a very short time. K, R, B, Ku, Dd, if you guys read this, thanks for popping by in my life.  Love you guysâ¦

       Tujuh Belas Agustus tahun Empat Lima, itulah hari kemerdekaan kitaâ¦   The march keeps on resounding in my head. Not that I did anything about it though. Heck, itâs a holiday!!! Right in the middle of a hectic week. Time for you to stop a minute and enjoy yourself, recharge yourself with your favorite pastime to deal with your daily routine.  Jakarta can be very pleasant during holidays. Man, I love this city. So yesterday we decided to go to the beach, just to celebrate the Independence Day (independence from traffic, that is). But the beach was just packed. Families, couples, and friends, all gathered to celebrate (God knows whatâ¦). Didnât stop us though. We parked the car and quickly raced to the nearest stall.  Imagine the soft beach wind blowing through your hair while youâre sitting under the trees, drinking coconut still in its shell, with your loved one stroking your back. Thatâs the sight in every corner you can find in Ancol. Yep, the cheap getaway where you can just order 2 coconuts and sit down talking for hours. Much unlike the rushed Starbucks, aye? But what is it about the beach that makes it almost perfect? Itâs so quiet (well, just take away the laughs and passer byâs, and itâs great), you can just sit and not mind anything at all. Before you realize it, the crowd ceased and itâs passed lunch time, and perhaps also time to go back to the crowded city.  Once we got back to the city, we went to see a movie (itâs been so long since I indulge myself in this hobby of mine). Lots of good movies lately if I may say. Only too little time to see all of them, unless we want to catch them all in DVD. Catwoman is one of those movies you watch for fun. You donât need to squint your eyes to enjoy it, and certainly not something that will be played in the festivals. But it sure was cool. The trip was concluded in Blok S. One amongst so many eating places that I like. The Sop Buntut Bakar of AG Steak was great!. Yum, been dreaming of one of those since Sunday, so it just felt good (and most of them will rest on my hip, darnit...).  Anyway, I did have a great time yesterday. Tuesdays never felt any better. And certainly no Independence Days like that. At least now I can say Iâve done something about that resounding march in my headâ¦   Merdeka!    Thanks Râ¦

      What is it about Technology? All my life, Iâve always been a laggard. I got my first cellphone long after everyone else did. VCD Players, and now DVD Players, theyâre familiar in each and everyone elseâs households but mine, at least not until later (way laterâ¦).  Can you blame me for cursing the  âseeminglyâ  comfortable life I lead now?  Personally, I prefer to live in the Dark Age, where people donât know any Cellular Phones, let alone compare between GSM and CDMA. It makes my life easier (in a way). For one, I could just play innocent for arriving home late without one single word, just tell my parents  âWhoops, sorry Mom, Dad, no Public Phone availableâ , and hope I can get off the hook. But the fact that I DO have a cellphone (working one that is), makes my life so difficult. Now Iâm addicted to making phone calls, send sms back and forth for some meaningless conversations â all to my own initiatives (I might as well call them and get it over with), taking lousy resolution pictures from my camera phone and blame the person I took pictures of, saying theyâre just too ugly to be in my camera phone (hahahaâ¦), lie to my parents every time I go home late, saying that I had put my cellphone on silent mode or that I rejected their phone calls because Iâm still stuck in traffic light. And second, in the end, I curse myself for overusing my cellphone and having to pay that horrendous phone bills.  More, I loved my life before Credit Card came along. Sure, no one made me apply in the first place. It was my stupid inner self, saying that I NEED Credit Card, which in the end I proved was wrong. Before the Age of Visa, I managed fine. But now, everything seems a lot easier to BUY and a lot more difficult to PAY. Yes, those conniving little Credit Card salesmen would just lurk around you, waiting for you to take out your own plastic money, and start offering heaven to you.  âUmm, Miss, our Credit Card offers lower interest, balance transfer, reward points, welcoming gifts, executive lounge, free annual fee, blah blah blahâ  And suddenly youâre just bending forward, starting to sign your application, and hope with Godâs mercy, you wonât be using them at all (hah, like thatâs ever going to happen)â¦  What with the Internet? Iâm addicted to browsing them in broad daylight now. The first thing I do when I got to my office desk is turn on my computer, and  voila , the web works at its most amazing speed to feed me information at my fingertips. Little do I realize that the more I browse, the less I have time for myself to contemplate on what I want to do with the rest of my day (hahaha, I never doâ¦).  My life was a lot easier before all these technology came along. I was doing great not knowing anything in other parts of the world (that I can find out in an instant from the web), I could save up my money and buy the things that I really really need, (and not just because I was out with friends and try to look macho and pay for their dinner bills), and I most of all, I can enjoy my quiet time without cellphone ring disrupting me (especially when itâs after office hours and the number appeared on your cell is your clientâs number).  But the fact that Technology dawns to our life with this rapid rate is inevitable. All you can do is give in. And perhaps be wiser enough not to let it consume you too muchâ¦  Easy for me to say, I just decided to surrender to the magic of Technology (that only makes your life easier by taking so much from youâ¦)  Damnit!!!

      6 in the morning. Mom woke me up. Sounded urgent, so I forced myself to wake up (otherwise, theyâre going to yell at me for coming home that late). Turned out Dad was just showing off his new entertainment centre (thatâs what I decided to call them). The new book shelf and a cabinet where he can stuff all his books, and my DVDs. We turned my sisterâs room into Entertainment Room. Hahaha, with one of those La-Z boy things, itâll be perfect.  So todayâs full. I convinced myself Iâd be able to set aside the whole K thing, and just enjoy my weekend (or at least I try toâ¦). Just like my usual Saturday mornings, I meet up with my 2 best friends at CCF. (I got no shame, Iâve dropped the class and I still waltz in every week just to meet with them, ouchâ¦) Itâs a holiday. They just finished Final test the week before. So I asked these girls to come for the stuff I brought from Madiun. Wow, I havenât met them in 3 weeks! A week ago was Madiun, and the previous week was Pelabuhan Ratu. Things sure change a lot, hahahaâ¦  Anyway, I arrived at 10.15am, 10 seconds later than L. We chatted about half hour before Ri finally showed up. Yeah yeah, she lives way across town, she always comes up with that excuse. But, hey, I canât complain. Theyâre the best set of best friends I could possibly meet.  Arranged to meet with R afterwards so L and Ri could finally meet him. We met up in Pasaraya Grande. All three were quickly acquainted. Hey, I think Iâll be doing this a couple more times before heâs finally IN. After all, I need my best friendsâ approvalâ¦  1 second after L and Ri got off the car, we left. Where to? Wherever we can kid ourselves and try to forget everything that happened the night beforeâ¦

      Desiree may be a superstitious girl. She never walks under ladders, and she keeps a rabbitâs tail. Me? Nope, not so much. Sure, I believe in all things said in the stars, (Iâm a huge believer of Astrology) but Iâm no fan of the horrible Friday the 13th curse. Or at least I thought soâ¦ That was before the last Friday incident. Uh-huh, they say Friday Iâm in love, but I had to take the bitter pill last weekend and say, hey, even when youâre in love, the universe will not stop for you.  Ra and I arranged to meet after office hours. We wanted to hang out at TC Kemang. We arrived around 8pm. (Ra is my oldest friend, I knew her since Elementary School) She said she wanted to meet R, the guy I said Iâm having this âthingâ with. Well, anyhow, I always run everything by her, what with her being my oldest friend and all. Turned out R is going out for a wedding reception with his friend, B. And so I said, well, if he wanted to catch up with us, just invite B, because Ra met B once, in TM meeting.  Little do I know (or even suspect anything that night) that something bad was about to happen. R did come, along with B, and Ku. These are 3 of the 4 guys in GB, who are like the closest friends of my very closest friend K. 1.5hr before Ra and I got to TC, I called K to invite her along, after all, these guys are her friends, right? By the way, the reason why I didnât want to invite her in the first place was because she said the previous day that sheâs having an event on Friday night, and so she cannot come to the wedding reception. But I took a wild shot anyway and called to ask her to come. But when I called her up, she said she was in a meeting and said sheâd call me back. Darn it, never thought that would start a fireâ¦  When the 3 guys arrived, I quickly introduced Ra to R, and Ku. And they were acquainted really fast. Not so long after, K sms-d B, she was mad at all of us for going out without her! Man, Iâm in deep s**t! After long finger pointings, whoâs to blame to cause her this furious, we finally decided, heck, itâs never going to solve anything, so we agreed to just let her calm herself first, and we might as well enjoy ourselves there. After all, there was live music, and pool table! Not to mention the nice coffee (or Java in Bâs term) to go along with all that.  Raâs friend D (my junior in FEUI) caught up with us, and we played some pool. Sheâs damn good, by the wayâ¦  Few minutes after midnight, we took off. I drove Ra to her house, and her dad opened the door, damn, he saw me driving all the 3 guys! This is going to reach my mom and dadâ¦ Dropped Ku off in Pertanian, and the 2 guys in Pasar Minggu (they can get home safely I supposeâ¦).  Got home around 1.30am, and had to wake my mom up to open the door (damnit, I brought my key, but they chose to leave theirs on so I couldnât walk in by myselfâ¦). I was so tired but the thought of setting off K was not very soothing. Couldnât rest my eyes for some time (damn Cappucinos). I tossed and turned for another hour. I finally gave up and decided to reach that Eragon I kept by the side of my bed. 5 minutes later, I was out.

      Funny how things change in a matter of minutes. Funny how I chose to deny myself of all the things granted to me in the past only to be forced to acknowledge them in an instant.  Love is blind, so they say. Heck, I never believed it. What, with all my believe about âlove at first sightâ? Love is never blind. Even blind man chooses their spouse by other attraction she has. Her voice, her scent, or even her touch.  Iâve always been granted with 2 serious âlove at first sightsâ in the past.  The first one went down the drain all for the name of âchangeâ. âYou changeâ, he said. I never regretted the fact that I had missed a lot when I was him for a long 2.5years. Nor do I ever regret the single moment I ever spent with him. The only thing I regret the most, why should we focus on âchangeâ and not focus on things that remain the same instead?  The second, and who I thought was going to be the last, was another heartbreak for me. 5 years I spent with him was not an easy ride. We floated like birds and also plunged to the deepest trough of our relationship. Never had he given up on us. I on the other hand, had said too many âitâs overâsâ when I really didnât mean it. We never changed. At least not until recently. Come to think of it, I refused to change. I can still remember vividly the smell of his breath when he wishes me good night, how his eyes slit when he laughs, even his stubby fingers and toes. I still remember every single little details he did when he was happy or sad. I still remember the very first time I heard his voice and how happy it sounded for hearing mine. I still remember the first note he scribbled for me. I still remember a lot about him more than I want to.  I still remember how madly in love we were when things were forced to change. Breakups are always hard to handle. Even more so when the only reason we were to break up was not because we stopped loving each other, but because we were forced to. And the saddest part is, the only people who we counted on the most to turn to, the people who gave birth to us, financed our lives up until we managed to live on our own, the people who we respect the most, were the people to cause such a terrible breakup.  Parents are great until they start becoming parents and start deciding how our lives should run. I am so fortunate to have the best pair of parents any children could ever dream of. Thanks for supporting me all the way Mom &amp;amp; Dad. And Iâm so sorry I couldnât live up to your expectations to convince him otherwise, when he decides to take the path his parents have chosen for him.  Love has caused too many heart breaks. If it were up to me, I would imprison Aphrodite and let Cupid do his work. And maybe then there will be no more jealousies and heart breaks.  Funny how I decided to take a drastic step ahead for my life hoping that it would change in the direction I want it to be. Funny how I could stop even to think that I missed my sole inspiration every step of my way when I have this whole new challenge before me.  Last night was a defining moment for me, and my future. No bets at stake. I didnât even bet myself that Iâd win this guy's heart in the first place. In fact, Iâve been trying so very hard in the past months to rid him. It only brought him closer.  Love is blind, huh? Perhaps this is the right time for me to acknowledge the wise Javanese saying  âwiting tresno jalaran soko kulinoâ.  Perhaps itâs now time that I accept it. I never expected to change. Nor do I wish that I could. I still want to savor the memory of me and my heartbreaker. But why me? Why of all this time, that I suddenly have the guts to say, âitâs time to move onâ?  If love CAN be bottled, Iâd definitely change the label. It should be âLove Poison #9â. For it only causes you heart breaks and heart burns.

      A very dear friend of mind just e-mailed me. He said some things that just made me frown. He asked, what is the purpose of having 8-10 hours taken from your life every single day, for something that is just beyond our comprehension. Sure, we need the money to provide food, to pay our bills, to just spend them on overpriced meals and drinks at Starbucks with your friends. But what is it that we really want to do with our lives? Well, for those of you who have figured it out, lucky you.  Work is demeaning to your life. I understand that more than I want to. And again, those of you who has the perfect jobs you always desired, you are the luckiest people on earth. Because more than half of this world are lacking that luxury.  So this is what I told himâ¦  Bâ¦  Poor you. How should I answer all your "Tumpahan", for Iâm feeling exactly the sameâ¦  B, Thereâs no place in this world worthy of your self pity. We are far too great to undermine ourselves and not be grateful for what He has given us. But evil is far too close to our daily living. Not a single day when I donât dread going to work. But then again, who would pay for my bills? Who would buy me food? Work is demeaning to your life. And thereâs not a single moment when I donât regret not doing this, and that, and not achieving this and that. In the end, damn, I just hate myself, and start wishing I were someone else.  Trust me B, so much as I hate saying this (even to myself), this is not a very good food for your ego. You lead a very interesting life. What, you play sports, something that most people are not lucky with. You graduated from one of the best Universities in Indonesia. You have a good job. You have damn great friends. If you hate looking yourself in the mirror so much, do what I do, donât look. Ever notice how every time I accidentally glanced at the mirror, I just felt insecure (and it shows).  B, Bâ¦  How I miss your sarcasm, your cynicism on life. All that you are only reminds me of what I am. Well B, they say misery loves company. And now that youâve dragged me into it, hurray!!!  Hahahaâ¦  Donât worry B. No one knows what they want to do in life either. And only the wise figures it out first...   That short e-mail I replied to him left me with nothing more than a big hollow mind. My friend there told me he still doesnât know what he really wants to do with his life. How about me? I gave killer advises but I know zilch about implementing them. B, if you ever got around to read this, hats off to you, mate.

      Madiun, where you can find the best Pecel all over Indonesia. A small city in East Jakarta that I never thought Iâd ever go to. But thanks to my dear college friend, Pipit, who got married and celebrated her wedding in the city, I finally got around to visit. By the way, CONGRATULATIONS PIPIT AND RAHMAD!!!  I left from Gambir station on Friday at 18.00 and arrived at 05.00 on Saturday morning. Not much to do to kill time once I got there, especially when you can go just about anywhere in flat 15minutes (that's how long it takes to circle the whole city). Saturday morning was Siraman. This is a very traditional Javanese wedding, mind you. So the ceremony is quite complicated. Pipit was drenched down. No less than 7 elderly relatives were honored to shower her with Air Kembang, this they say, to cleanse her inner self so she would be ready for her marriage life. I never thought Iâd enjoy Javanese weddings ceremony before, but this one was very interesting. Siraman ended about time for lunch. And after helping myself for some delicious meal they have prepared for their guests, I took off.  After circling the city looking for souvenirs (what else but the famous Sambel Pecel, Brem Madiun, Madumongso, and Nting-Nting kacang), I ended up riding that poor becak with a big box full of souvenirs (still doubted myself how Iâm going to take everything home, all by myself).  Saturday night was Akad Nikah or most people there call it Ijab Kabul. Pipit said her vows, and Rahmad said his, all witnesses confirmed before Penghulu, and they were legally married. The ceremony was over within 1 hour. And left me (again), wondering, how can I spend the rest of this yet still lovely evening? And sadly, I chose to go back to the hotelâ¦  Sunday morning was yet another interesting ceremony. Temu Manten was the one ceremony in which the Bride was displayed in the âPelaminanâ while waiting for her Groom who was about to enter. As both people walk towards each other, they would have to throw this banana leaf knot to each other. They said this symbolizes who liked whom first, or perhaps, who would be dominant in the marriage. Whatever, it was a crowd! Two well-dressed people throwing things at each other, and afterwards walk side-by-side to welcome their guests. Wowâ¦ Temu Manten also finished around noon. But this time, I was determined not to go back to the hotel but I went with some friends I met there. We had a huge lunch in Magetan. Thatâs only like 30 minutes from the heart of Madiun. Not much to see, but the food was great there.  1 hour before the reception, we went back to Iâs place (thatâs Pipitâs high school friend who also works in Jakarta now), R drove us all. The Reception was held at Graha Bhakti Praja, the biggest and most famous Hall in Madiun. Once we enter the room, it felt like the whole Madiun people were there. It was so crowded, and I suddenly felt so out of place. Whatâs a person like me doing here, all by myself. I couldnât wait to go back home. But R said it would only take 5minutes from the Hall to the train station, I better wait there.  Anyway... 22.00 Sunday night. Itâs finally time for me to go back home. Jakarta, here I come!!!  What can I say about Madiun? The fact that it made me miss the fast paced and crowded Jakarta? Or that I spent the whole weekend there (almost) all by myself (no thanks to a certain person who cancelled 3 hours before the departureâ¦)? Or is it the fact that it made me realize just how good I felt riding Becak and felt the hard wind blowing my un-made hair? Or simply that I enjoyed the serene city, and that I enjoyed the wedding ceremony so much, that I want to shout to that dear friend âHey, K, you missed A LOT!â  Jakarta... I would never trade living in this high crime rate city nor would I trade having to storm the traffic for like 1.5 hours (max) before I get to work, nope, not for that too tranquil town. But, you know, one day I wouldnât say no to coming back there again, and perhaps this time, Iâm not going to miss Jakarta so soonâ¦  Thanks Pit...

      So today is one of those days that could just turn your entire mood off. The fact that I'm bearing the most mind numbing job in the whole world is one thing. But the fact that today everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves is another.  The announcement today about our company (worldwide) is going through a joint venture sounds appealing at first. Wow, we'll have opportunity to be transferred overseas (hahaha, you wish). But somehow the longer we sit and let the words seep in, the more I'm convinced that it's time to move on (or at least die trying)...  Do you ever feel that youâre not sufficient enough, even for yourself? Well, the road is about to open wide in that direction. Every single (better) companies I applied to in the past month has been either sending me a rejection letter, or simply play the cool and ignorant recruitment people who could not care less about peoplesâ feelings and decide to just not give any words after 3 interviews. Thatâs just great. And the saddest part is, no matter how hard I try to console myself (by saying: âItâs their loss, youâve got the whole potential, and if they didnât realize it, well, there are still a million other jobs out there, waiting for you to give your best work and prove yourself worthy of their handsome compensation packageâ), somewhere deep inside me shouts: âLoserâ¦â Damnit, wish I were deaf, and can pretend I didnât hear itâ¦  I ran into a couple of long lost friends (from High school) during lunch this afternoon. And the âbestâ of my day has just begun. Guess what, one of them is getting married next February.  Thatâs like the 3 friends (just from that clique alone) to get married this year. Darn it! And what are the odds of this happening when I just had a serious break up with someone that has been in my life for 5 years? Okay, I know I should be happy for her. But when is my turn? Will I have to wait another 5 years just to face another disappointing end? I know Iâm not gonna marry someone whom I just met and know for less than a month, heck, Iâm not that hasty. But help me, I need to see the light, pleaseâ¦  So, what Iâm feeling right now is .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

      Okay...  So I have this wide and blank page. I mean, what should I do? Heck, beats me. Just trying to get some writing done.  Hmm, is it true that you can judge a person by their writing? Well, don't jump into that conclusion about me just yet. This is the first page.  Be back with more.  Oh, and by the way, thanks for introducing Blogger.com to me, Arie. Will surely make the best use of it.  Later then...
