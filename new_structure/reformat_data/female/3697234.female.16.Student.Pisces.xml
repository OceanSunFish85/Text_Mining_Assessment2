       I've never be more sincere in my life.  I'm sorry . I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry dad... I'm sorry Jonathan... I'm sorry Silver, I'm sorry Roslyn, I'm sorry Andrew... I'm sorry everyone I've ignored, I'm sorry everyone I've lied to, I'm sorry everyone who had to see me and know how fucked up I'd been living my life. I'm sorry Franklin, for not listening to you sooner...  I'm sorry Alex, for being so scared to commit. I'm sorry Travis, for being a whore even though we weren't anything. I'm sorry Cindy Lee, I'm sorry Jaya, and I'm sorry to everyone else who's tried to offer me help but I've refused. I thought I was at rock bottom. Things can't get worse than this. Or so it seems.  No, it gets worse. The thoughts start coming back... and I'm growing weak... All i can do is play this game and hope I'll come out on the winning team... Everything is so fragmented, nothing makes sense but at the same time it could never be more clear. I'm scared. I'm scared for my life because I KNOW there is much more I could give. But I'm tired. I'm tired of waking up in the morning only to know I'll have to do the same thing the next day. Tired of faking my entire fucking life. There is no passion, no desire, no nothing. Just cold. I feel dead to the world. There is no one to confide in. There are plenty of people who understand, but what do they do? They make me crave it even more. All I ever hear is how they hate themselves, how they want to dieâ¦ I try to comfort, try to reassure, but my words are meaningless. They have no truth.   This depression does not come from my actions. I know this because Iâve had it before. I was thirteen years old on the verge of mental break down. I stopped eating, couldnât sleep, and attempted suicide. Twice. It was motherâs day weekend. I spent it in bed. There was no significance. I just couldnât cope any more. Now I have a possible felony, and up to 6 months in Arapahoe House. Iâm scared. If I donât make it now, I wonât make it in there. Nah, it has nothing to do with the peopleâ¦ they donât scare me, they donât intimidate me at allâ¦. Everybody in there is gonna have a biiiiiig fuckin FRONT. LIES, LIES, LIESâ¦â¦ I canât make it in their fucking âprogramââ¦ with structured activities day in and day outâ¦ my mood does not ALLOW me to do soâ¦ Iâll be at my grandmaâs funeral in NY when Iâm supposed to show in court, but I know there will be no excuse after that. Itâs either end it, or end it. End my life or find a way to end the way my brain is working.   Again, Iâm sorry. Iâm sorry, sorry, sorry. Peace* Danielle
