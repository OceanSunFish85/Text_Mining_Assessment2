      You know, being a girl is harder than it looks. There are so many details to deal with, it's rediculous. Today I had my first appointment at the Gyno's. Not that scary...plus, i got sooo much free stuff, it's rediculous! 3 months worth of free birth control, tampons, face wash, a pack to keep it all in...i love medical samples. Marg, when you're a doctor, please get me free samples. And like, pens and stuff. Anyawy, i'm a little apprehensive about all the responsibility involved with sex...but we'll see how it goes. Oh, and here's to being done with Junior year for real for real. </post></Blog>
