      This is lovely. A new blog, a new life, just "a new." Well today was extremely boring. My brother wouldn't take me to Starkville so I couldn't get my Blue Converse. Darn him. I went to my Aunt's house for supper. She can cook good. I  NO . Because that's my friend, and plus I go with Tregory. So yeeeah, that will just make the tension worse. Oh well. Anyways that's my day. I will try to update alot. Later. </post></Blog>
