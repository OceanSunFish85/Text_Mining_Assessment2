       internet connectn's surpassed itself yet again, progressin from takin eons  to load a page to  flat refusal  to load a page?! bAhh this is consequence of livin w/l broadband nnot gettin lazie arze down to reformattin ailin comp..     when comes to dealin with errant electronic gadgets, my standardprotocol of behaviour is much similar to that of patient momsighin resignedlyat latest kiddie pranks n mishaps, acceptinfact that  child is juz gnna be naughtie,any effort required to correct behaviour involves too darn much of an effort to bother considerin .. but surely there comes a time when tolerance threshold is crossed n u juz have to lift bumm off comfie parkinn  whack  the lil prankster on the head to get him to  cut it out ??!        have allowed comp behaviour to get ridiculously outta hand.. to demonstrate simply, this is wat actuallieappears when i type noww:       bloURDÃE hEC{K u glo6in 6insane       wat dlo u th6in[k u r dlo6in clomp6in lout 2 [keys at a t6ime u p6iece lof !#%$   ))**wHAC{K)*)*      (certain keys r comin out 2 at a time in case u haven't figured)       laziness still prevailed afterall in me case: have adoptedpractice of patiently goin back each sentence typed to erase xtra incoherance..      "woAH this muzbe takinu an aWFUL lOTTA timeto type?!!  "     i hear u squeak..     yeahh well it sure does takes wayy longer than usual, but in me case as always,   laziness  n  procrastinatn   have yet again proven to prevail over   common sense  n healthy normalhuman behaviour ..         ** laziness kills..    but if not..    juz slows n inconveniences time.. i sppoze?? **
