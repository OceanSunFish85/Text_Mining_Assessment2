        it's me. i am at work, bored. rather be bored than be too busy here. too busy means too stressful.            started atkins on monday. was doing good until last night, had pancakes....oops. starting over today.            i haven't been to church in what seems like forever. i feel bad about it. i can tell when i haven't gone or read my bible in a while, my attitude reflects it. i need to go this sunday. i have been working sunday mornings (did i mention i work in airline operations - 24/7 operation) so i get lazy when i get home and don't go on sunday nights. i am excited though cuz my church is starting a new service on saturday nights. it's suppose to be "cooler" more geared towards the younger crowd. funny cuz my church is pretty edgy anyway, so getting edgier will be intrigueing....            ok, so why do people just naturally feel that they are superior to others. ESPECIALLY when they are clearly not. i work with this guy who just talks down to everyone around him, especially women. seriously i think he thinks we are all trailor trash with an i.q . of 10. we are all management level here so with a few exceptions (and funny...those exceptions are boys) we are all pretty intelligent and most of us have college degrees......i have to work with him all week. so get to put up with his superiority complex.maybe he is trying to compensate for another area of his life that he is lacking in.....just sayin...............wow! i just heard him talk down to his boss....now he's really daring.....            so, going to eat my protein breakfast. I want to lose 29 pounds before 10/26. reason is a secret....will reveal that later...........            oh, this democratic convention itself is not getting on my nerves. as a matter of fact it's helping in my decision making for this upcoming election. i'm registerd democrat but have been pretty much independant for that last decade or so.           I am a confused girl in search (again) for what I really believe in. I know I believe in absolute morals, I believe in feeding the hungry, protecting children, in education......But I don't believe in making the rich richer, feeding the homeless' drug habits....so, where is that middle line????? I used to be so sure of what I believed in. Was a member of several organizations, an active member.....But now I question those things....I am older, I am a parent. things change and so do my thoughts......
