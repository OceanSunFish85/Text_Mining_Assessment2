      â Di mana murid ini?â  Iâm sure when my Add Maths teacher pointed to my seat today during the first period and asked the question, she will get this answer --&gt;âabsentâ.   I was absent today. I caught a fever. That is the reason why I was absent. I stayed at home and take a good rest for a faster recovery. Haha.. In fact, Iâve an enjoyable time at home.  I watched the Band competition VCD that was distributed yesterday. Lastly, I knew how was the performance being carried out on that night by my own eyes. Since the competition, I just listen to othersâ comments, now I can make the judgement myself. It wasnât that terrible like what I think. Itâs ok. However, many mistakes occurred when the formation was performed. The mistakes werenât any minor mistakes that other people might not notice about, but they were the mistakes could be easily seen even though they were not professional.  I was very happy as I was off today. I havenât done my Add Maths homework. I scared my teacher will scold me again ler.. Furthermore, I donât feel like going to school too. Letâs see todayâs timetable:  7:30am â 8:35am : Add Maths  8:35am â 9:45am : English  9:45am â 10:20am : EST  10:20am â 10:45am : Recess  10:45am â 11:55am : Chemistry  11:55am â 1:10pm : Chinese  Errâ¦ It wasnât that fine to have all these subjects together in a day. =-(   When I wasnât around in school today, will my classmate miss me? I hope they will. I think my seatmate will miss me a lot, I was told that sheâll feel very lonely if nobody is sitting beside her. It doesnât mean that my presence carry great importance to her. Hehe.. And I know Iâm not an important role in my class. Anyway, Iâm happy with who I am. I know I might be important to somebody. =) like....... my parents

      There were some small incidents happened in the library today. When I was studying with my friend (the one who sit beside me in class), my BM teacher who is also my library teacher advisor came near and teased us. How? She joked âKedua-dua kamu sudah janji belajar bersama-sama di sini?â It sounded like we are dating in the library. Hahaâ¦ Werenât we? Erm.. yes, I think we were. We have dated each other to do some revision in the library this afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. Hahahaâ¦   One of the library users fell asleep, Madam Foo (the librarian) wake up the girl but she was stared by other students. Anyhow, she was just too tired; it wasnât her fault. I was tired too. Somehow I nearly fell asleep too. The number of the Library users has been increased since last 2 weeks when the opening hours have been extended from 3:30pm to 5:30pm     ** Life's really tiring... =(

      Todayâs Man Looâs (my classmate) birthday, sheâs my class treasurer. I think she has a nice birthday today. During the first lesson, one of my school teacher send a bouquet of âflowerâ to her upon somebodyâs request. The flowers are not red roses or plastic flower, but they are 11 different flavours lollypops. Wow! Itâs really romantic. Some of my classmates were having a celebration with her in canteen during the recess time. They bought a cake for her. This year, I was not involved in the celebration since I was not informed. Man Loo, Happy birthday.   P/s : Hey, friends. Next year I want to have a birthday celebration too!! Remember.. Hehe =)

             âPre-marital sexâ     What do you think about it? The question was discussed in class today during the English lesson. I am one of them who do not agree with the issue.   Pre-marital sex is getting more and more common in our society nowadays. People used to make it a sign to symbolize the loves to his/her partner or to represent the trust that lies between he and his partner. But, are we 100% guarantee that he/she is our life partner? If unwanted pregnancy occurs, will they responsible to it? Besides, if unluckily the âheâ is still a teenager who does not have the ability to make a living, how could he responsible to the unexpected matter?   Secondly, I do agree with my teacher who implied the dangers that we would be exposed to when we have pre-marital sex. The main danger we will face was the infection of the AIDS. We do not know whether our partner is one of the HIV-carrier. For me, I definitely would not risk myself to such a danger that will affect my whole life. Whatâs more, unwanted pregnancy might be happened too. People are saying that they are having safety-sex. However, I do not want to elaborate on it anymore, Itâs just scary to imagine that a teenager was pregnant and she has to stop her study just because of the accident. Itâs really frightening.   I strongly agree with another teacher of mine who remind us that loves canât be represent by anything, especially sex. True love does not need anything to signify the sincerity or to prove the trustworthiness between the couple. I believe that whoever who asks for sex so that his/her partnerâs love is signify is definitely not the one who treats the relationship sincerely and seriously. Donât you agree with it?   P/s: You are welcome to voice your opinion here.

      The competition had over. For us, I donât think it is the best performance among all the practices we have had during this 2 months, not even better than the performance during the qualifying round.    I think we have to re-think the mistakes that we had made today.  Firstly, The seniors shouldnât scold the juniors before the competition during the hair-setting time.  Secondly, The seniors do not give enough encouragement to the juniors (especially the Form / Form 2 juniors)  Thirdly, most of the members were not confident with themselves.  Hope all these mistakes would not occur again in future.    However, we have to accept the reality, we are the loser. We canât deny that SMK Nan Hwa is really the best band in Perak. They are so proficient. The songs that they choose for the competition are very nice. I like the percussion of the school. They have good skills. Fantastic!! They are very friendly too. We took some photographs after the competition was over. The percussionist from both the school built up a good relationship after the competition. In fact, some of the percussionists have already known each other.    Finally the competition has over. However, I feel hardly to leave the band. I felt in love to the band since last 2 months. I like the juniors, I like the drums, I like my section, and I like the way in which we aim for something together. Time passed fast. Yesterday was my last formation practice in my whole life. =-(    Itâs time to concentrate on study. The SPM trial is just around the corner. 1 month for it. Iâve to concentrate on my study from now onwards. No more practice and no more duties. All the activities have over. Add maths and Chemistry questions, Iâm looking on you. =P

      I found that Iâm really a cry-baby. Recently, I used to cry very often. No matter what it is, as long as I canât cope with it or I donât well with the situation and I become pessimist, then my tearsâ¦ Perhaps my teacher was right; Iâm too emotional, I couldnât think or decide rationally. Iâm selfish; I only care about myself but neglect the whole team.    Anyway, I make a deal with my section leader today; I appealed to her for one more chance in condition she will examine my skills tomorrow before she make up her mind. If she examines it justly, I swear Iâll accept her decision; however, I couldnât promise that I will not cry if her decision is out of my expectation.    The competition will be on tomorrow. Feeling nervous and scare. I have no idea about what would be happening tomorrow, neither the quality of the performance that will put up in Stadium Perak by all of us.  I pray hard not to forget any minor steps in the formation. As my teacher said, we really need rest and be relax now. I agree with her. Iâm stress with the competition; I feel that I need a good resting time today.    P/s : No disturbance tonight. =)  Competition countdown : 1 day

Read the lyric of the song heartily, it is meaningful.    We were supplied with this lyric during the practice today. My tears were almost dropped from my eyes for a few moments. I was touched with the meaning. Some of the Form 5 girls have the same sentiment when we were reminded that we are going to leave the school soon too. In the past few years, I spend most of the time in school. I have stayed in this school for 11 years. A lot of pictures were flashing across my mind in the very moment. Such as the farewell for Mrs Lai, the graduation night for the Form 5 students, farewell gathering for the band seniors, etcâ¦Soon, Iâll leave my friends, my teacher, my juniors and my school; I am sure I would miss them a lot.    My tears are not worthy. No doubt, I will be the first person who shed tears whenever there is a sad ceremony, especiallyit is a farewell. That is the reason that I donât feel like attending the farewell for Mrs Lai. I donât want other people see me crying. Still, Iâve no choice about it,itis compulsory forall of usto attend the ceremony.    Tomorrow will be the last day for band practices. We are no longer required to attend the practices after the competition. =( Missing the moment when we are linking together practicing the formation, posture, musicalâ¦      Competition countdown : 2 days

      Sunday - I was off from school lesson but not from band practice. Practices are held as usual. Tired but enjoyable.    Besidesthe practices,assignments and Add maths homework pile up like mountain, when can I finish them?? Help me!!    I attended a birthday party last night. Itâs boring. I did not talk much in the party. Maybe Iâm not sociable. Further more, I was not feeling well last night. Fever. Haihâ¦ =(   Final competition count down - 3 days.

      It was a nice party for me. I enjoyed myself in the party. This year, most of the Form 5 (about 80%) attended the farewell party. Even though we had some quarrel during the preparation, it endedwell.   Firstly, I want to mention about the âinvitation cardâ. It was the most special invitation âcardâ among those Iâve seen before. It is a bottle with a piece of paper inside it.  â Calling 4 our beloved PPS senior â04,  Remember our Rendezvous?  Meet us at cool morning at AMC OLD HALL, 8:30am â 12:00pm, 17/07/2004.  See u thereâ¦ !!!â    The programme wasnât that exciting. However, I know that they have already put in a lot of effort to make it a success. Thank you, juniors.    An unforgettable incident has happened today. The senior lost in the competition. The junior group, form by all the librarians from form 1 to form 4 beat us. We have to face the penalty. The junior got a box of ice; they will put the ice into our shirt for 10 seconds. Every junior has a chance to do so. I was the one with bad luck. Every junior was looking for me to take revenge on me. Whole of my shirt wet. =-(  *Warning - Never bethedisciplinary mistress/ master.    I took a few photos with my juniors. Unfortunately, the photos are not so clear. I will take some photos again with them. Hope they wonât decline my request. Heheâ¦ =D    P/s â Band final competition count down : 4 days.

      The competition went smoothly today. Our performance was neither good nor bad. I'm satisfied with the performance. Some of the juniors make some minor mistakes; they feel sorry and guilty about it. After the competition, some of them were cryingbecause ofthe mistakes. As usual, the seniors were busy calming down the juniors. This will be an important lesson for them. After this competition, they should know how the minor mistakes could affect the formation. Learn from the mistakes, hope the mistake will not happen again in the final competition, which will beheld on next Wednesday (21/7/2004).   Iam thankful to the teacher advisor. We got the free lunch after the competition in the canteen. Somehow, it is an encouragement to all of us.   P/s : Pray that no more rumours anymore about the band competition.

      Tomorrow will be the competition. As it will held in my school tomorrow, it is a privilege for us. All of us are very anxious about it, especially the juniors (those who represent the band for the first time in the competition). I hope we can put up a nice performance so that we can qualify ourselves into the finalist. Wish for all the best. AMC Boleh! Pray for us. =)

      I bought a pair of contact lens. It costs RM 25. As this is the first time, I had a bad time with it. I spent more than half an hour to put on the lens on my right eye. Yet, I failed.  I finally did it after I tried it out few more times. But, my eyes were aching and so uncomfortable with it. I think spectacles suit me more.  I swear Iâll not wear it anymore after the competition. I swear.

      It was a nice weekend. I went to Parade to watch amovie with 2 friendsâ Spiderman 2. I was shocked when I know that the entranceticket for themovie cost RM9 each. Moreover, it was a weekend, so, student cards was out of bounds. No discount for students. However, themovie is really fascinating. It does impress me. Everyone should go to watch out the movie; you will never regret to do so although the tickets are really expensive!Trust me.   A small joke occurs: We, three of us who are already 17-years-old. When we get together, we name ourselves as The Power Puff Girls. Iâm the Bubble. Haha! Amazing??   It was a reportcard day yesterday. Of course, I got my reportcard. I was not pleased with it. Anyway, I will work harder to achieve better result in the trial exam. I know I can make it. =)

      I'm very lucky today. Something lucky has happened to me:  1. I got my teacher permission excuse from the band practice on 17th July. I can attend the Farewell gathering which held specially for the Form 5 library prefects.  2. When I crossed a road, I was NEARLY hit by a car, it was just an inch away from me. I could feel the car. If I've not enough lucks today, I might be in the hospital now. 3. When I took the bus home, I bought a RM1.00 ticket as usual. I was given a ticket which number is 7932. Guess what does it mean? Try to add up all the digits in the number. 7+9+3+2 = 21 !!  What is so special with the ticket? I was told by a friend that I will have a chance to make a wish after I have collected 3 tickets which the addition of all the digits are equal to 21. Although some will think it is silly. However, I believe it even though I think it might be not true. It can be a hope, a wish, a dream or even a belief. Is there anything wrong with it?  Am I lucky today? Yes I am.   P/s: Today is my birthday (Count it according to the Chinese Calender)

      I am very unhappy with the attitude of some of my classmate . Just can't tolerate with them. I have enough with that. I'm sure some of you may face the same problems too. Sometimes the people attitude is just unacceptable.   As in my case, I have some classmate who is irresponsible. They do not care about other people's feeling. What a selfish person they are. While we were doing experiment in the Laboratory this morning, one of my friend and I were the one who readied the apparatus for the experiment, but they were the people who did the experiment. They refuse to get the apparatus from the back of the Laboratory and they do the experiment without giving much time to other member in the group the experiment, we are the ones who clean up the place but they are the ones who leave first without glancing back. I hope one day they will change their attitude. ......!!  The form 5 librarians do not seem to accept my explanation. They have prejudice towards the Form 4 librarians. Some of them heard that the Form 4 librarians stab us in the back. Ai... Why should we care about that? Those were just rumours. Let's just concentrate on our studies and look up for the party. Instead of having bad mood everyday, why don't we take it easy?

      Ai.. Today in class, my BM teacher inform us that our SPM trial will be arriving soon. It will be on for 2 weeks, starts from 6 Sept until 17 Sept. For me, it is bad news. I have not yet  prepared for it. What is my feeling now? I think I am like "an ant on the fire". Feeling worry and unsettled. What can I do? I pray hard now that my all my revision could be finished before the examination arrives. Pray for me!! Pray for all the Form 5 students as well.

      I feel very sorry for my teacher advisor. Some misunderstanding occurred recently between the Form 5 Committee members and the Organizing committee of farewell gathering. Somehow we, the Form 5 seniors are not satisfied with the behavior that is shown by the juniors during the preparation for the gathering.   We do want the gathering can be carried out in a better mode. We hope for the best memory before we leaves the school. I do not deny that we have make a lot of request about the gathering. We request better food, we request better medal, we request exciting games. I know that we shouldn't demand too much. But, what we care about is just a happy and memorable farewell. At least there will be some sweet memory for us.   Anyway, I'm sorry and guilty to heard my teacher said "I think I'm the one who should be blamed on."  What does it means? My teacher advisor suggest to make the farewell party has more fun by having the party outside the school compound. However, what is in her mind does not match with ours ideas. Then, she feels that carry out the party in 5-6 hours is not a good idea since the girls and other teachers may not want to stay back. So, they make the decision to carry out the party in 4 hours, that means the party will be held at 8:30am to 12:00pm. For us, we think that they mean to carry out the party with no other meaning except to carry out the party as a practice every year.   After I listened to my teacher explanation, I was convinced that we were absolutely wrong. My teacher was meant to make the party as fun as it cans. However, we, who are childish jump into the conclusion that the juniors were not sincere in the preparation. Now, I just wan to apologize to my teacher advisor and the juniors for the misunderstandings. Sorry to those who are concern. =(

      Write something in blogger.com? It's a new thing in my life. The first time in 17 years. Anyway, it's really a difficult task for me. I'm having a serious language problem. I look in to all the consideration before I make the decision to start it off. I remember one of my friend told me before that every person should keep a journal/ diary for himself/herself to see how far he/she grows. I do agree with that. Of course, what I've experienced now may be the guidance for me later in my life.

      Nothing significant happened today. I wandered around in the library after the school dismissal. I planned to go there and study for a while before I go home. However, I ended up gossiping with my friends. I was so happy since the anger I kept it inside my heart for so long could be poured out eventually. I was really unhappy with one of my classmate. I really couldnât stand her attitude. My blood was boiling when I talked about her just now. Anyway, Iâm ok now.  My friends praised me. They said that another friendâs autograph book was so nicely decorated by me. Heheâ¦ I do impressed with my own work too. Please let me praised myself a bit. I really spent some time on it. =)

      Iâm quite busy recently. My trial will be coming soon. I left 3 more weeks. I think I canât finish my revision in time. Worrying what to do next. I changed my daily routine. For the last few days, I did not stay back in school anymore. I take the bus home after the school dismissed. I take a nap after I reach home. I feel better after some sleeps. Guess what? I could study until 11:30pm after I took the nap in the afternoon (I usually go to bed at 9:30pm last time) without feeling tired at all! How amazing. Hope this could help me.   Nothing much happen these few days. Study, study and study, nothing more activities besides that. I think life is getting boring. Haihâ¦ Today, we learnt about the function of our brain during the biology lesson. My teacher told us that females are actually smarter than the males. Haha! I agree with it. My teacher said the femalesâ left-brain and right-brain have closer connection. They are better in expressing their feelings and thoughts. Thatâs the reason why females are accused that they are very emotional. Not like guys who are always keep the feelings with themselves and sometimes not even know how to express their feeling. What do you think? Heheâ¦  I think I have to stop here. I've to prepare the dinner now.If not my mother will blames me again. Tonight I will have some fish for dinner. So, I've to fry them now. My dinner night (Form 5 graduation dinner) will be held on next Friday. Looking for it. =)  P/s: Just for your information, I apologized to my god-brother since I think I was wrong when I treated him madly without thinking his feelings. We are still brother and sister now. My relationship with my mother does not improved much as she points her finger at me repeatedly for some mistakes that were actually not caused by me which are really irritated me.   p/s 2 : Why my classmates like to think that me and my god-brother have some unknown relationship leh? Is there really no pure-brother and sister-relationship in their eyes? Do you know what they would defend themselves from this question? They will give me this answer : "Yes, I believe. But not for you and your god-brother" HUH? Why? tell me why....

      I was throwing tantrums to my family members just now. I just couldnât hold back my temper anymore. I shouted to my sister. I argued with my mother. I took back my calculator from my younger sister even though sheâs using it. I did not talk to my father. I donât understandâ¦ Is it my fault again?  My mother left a plastic bag beside the rubbish bin. Inside the plastic bag still has some thing that she wanted to use later. My father threw away the plastic bag with all the rubbish (because it looked like rubbish). I reminded my mother not to put the bag there since it really looked like rubbish and I mistaken it this morning too. She did not listen to it and she just let it being thereâ¦. Thenâ¦ When she came to ask me whether her thing was thrown, I know that sheâll definitely shout to my father if I donât stop her when he came back. I tried to stop her. I explained to her. However, I feel frustrated that time. Trust me, I have already tried so hard to control my temper. Yet, I failed. I think I talk to her in impolite tone.   I donât want her to shout to my father. I donât want any wars to begin. Itâs really very tired to see them argued everyday. I donât want to see them scolding each other, complaining about another. Enough. Itâs enough for me. I want a happy family. Not a family with hatred between the parents. I donât want to listen to their complaints. I donât want to hear them shouting to each other in the early morningâ¦ I donât want â¦  Then, I cooked porridge to my sister whose face was puffed up after she went to the dentist. I planned to add in some egg to make the porridge tastier. She told me she cannot has egg these few days, then I asked her to got some porridge first before I add in the egg into the porridge. But she told me since THE PORRIGDE was not READY, and she did not want to have any. In fact, the porridge was well cooked. She did not appreciate my effort and yet she got on my nerves when I was irritated at the moment. Ok.. I saved some for her. I did not get any appreciation, not even one thank you from her. What I got? I got bad criticism. Why she must did that to me?   My mother scolded me. She scolded me that I purposely shouted to my sister because I want to show her my anger and dissatisfactory. Is it my fault? I did not mean that. Sheâs the one who come to irritate me.  Iâm the one who did the housework today. I cleaned the laundry. I boiled the water. I cooked for them. But why they canât see these?? Why they only saw the negative point?  Please tell me is it my fault to do so? Am I wrong?

      What should I do? Am I wrong? I really donât knowâ¦ Please tell me if you have any idea about it.   Last night I was really down. Again, my mood was affected by the incident where I mention before. I was very happy when he told me that he did not cheat during the exam and he didnât plan to do so in the exam that will be held next week.  However, after some talks, things seem changing. I forgot how the incident happened until it became worse. I was really couldnât hold back my temper. I was frustrated. Perhaps heâs right. We cannot want every people to think the same way as I am. For the case, I donât think itâs wrong to make people to think in this way â  i.	Cheat in the exam is wrong.  ii.	Rules are definitely not set for people to break it.  iii.	Discussion does improve people, but not discuss during the exam iv.	Exam is designed to test the people how much has he/she learnt in certain period.  v.	Monthly test is also an Exam. We should treat it with right manner.  Itâs all about self-disciplined. Those who donât have any self-disciplined would want to break the rules. It depends on oneâs self-principals too.   What really suck my head was he asked me not to care and he thinks that itâs not wrong to do so during the exam. Maybe you will ask me why I still care about him even though he asked me not to do so. The reason only one, cause heâs my god-brother and my friend too. I can ignore his actions if heâs nobody, but not when heâs someone who plays important part in my life. I sent him e-mail. I really need sometime to think whether I should continue our relationship. I think itâs not worthy to put on so much of care on him but it is not appreciated. Now, Iâm not sure whether Iâm right to take such action.   My teacher told me before, we canât make any decision for others, and we can only remind them. If they refuse to accept the advice, we canât do anything, just let it be.   Perhaps, what another friend told me last night was right. He said: âcontrol on what we can, donât worry on what we canât. I think Iâve been worry too much. My worries do not mean anything to him. And I have been worried too much and itâs over the limit. Frankly, Iâm those kind of person who could not leave my friends alone in troubles. I would like to help them; I would like them to get away from troubles.   For this case, I know clearly what would happen if he really cheat during the exam. People in his class, especially the girls who come from my school, who want justice will look down on him. Perhaps they will make some reports too. I donât want to see him got into all this kind of situation. I donât want other people to look down on my friends. I really donât want.   Now, what should I do? Should I just leave him alone with his own decision? I feel helpless and confuse. Please tell me what should I do if you do have any ideas. I will appreciate it. Sorry if you do not understand what Iâm writing. I just canât make it clearer.

      Iâm sorry that my blog was not updated for the last few days. Thereâs nothing special happen in these few days. Life continues in a regular routine. Things seem to be happened in a same way everyday, go to school from home, and then go back when the school dismissed. Then the next day will repeat the same things again, except the lessons we have in school are slightly different everyday.   However, there are some special things do cheer me up in last 2 days. I met one of my friend who Iâve lost âface-contactâ for 1 year. We went for lunch together on Tuesday. During the one year, he does not seem has any changes. Heâs still so shy.. (haha.. actually heâs not that shy lar) His friend who accompanied him stabbed his back in front of me. Since we met almost everyday online, we did not have any special topics. Heheâ¦ It was really a good moment for me to meet with an âoldâ friend once in a while.  On Wednesday, I met with another friend of mine at the bus stop where I usually go. Both of us are in the Form 5 this year and we got the same examination pressure as the SPM trial examination is just around the corner. Thereâs only 31 days to go, exactly 1 month left. I was glad that heâs willing to take the same bus with me that day. Reason? He will be reach home 45 minutes later if he took the same bus as mine. Hahaâ¦ Although it wasnât any big sacrifice, I appreciated it.   Today, I realized how important the band was to me. I had a band practice just now. I miss the practice a lot since we were off for 2 weeks after the competition. I attended the practice; I was really enjoying myself just now. Even though many members were âmissingâ, we have had an enjoyable moment. We played the music without any pressure (which we experienced during the competition). The songs, which were played just now, fully filled with feelings. I found out that I love the band so much. I couldnât imagine what would I be after I left the band. Heheâ¦ =) Anyway, Iâll remember every moment which I have gone through in these few years. Now, I could firmly say, âI never regret Iâm a band memberâ.

      I was really very irritated last night. I was told by on of my friend that he is going to cheat during the coming exam. Heâs really turning my head off! I am really against with this kind of habit. I couldnât tolerate with him no matter what he said. I couldnât believe a good student would do this kind of things. What make me angry the most was he did not feel any sorry or regret to what heâs going to doâ¦   He was cheating himself. It isnât an âEXERCISEâ as what he said. He refused listen to my advice and I think he would carry on his âplanâ. Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! I think I should let him go, just as what he said: âJUST IGNORE MEâ.  Perhaps, I have already gone too far from certain extent. I think I have put too much expectation on him. I know it clearly that Iâm a no-body to him and he does not have to listen to any of my words. Ok, I shall think about it again.   To everyone of you who pass by this page:  Please, never cheat during the exam. Itâs not the way. Even though you know you might fail the test or get a 0 for the test, pleaseâ¦ do not cheat. Itâs your fault. You should blame yourself and think about it clearly why you will fail the exam. Those who donât study for their test should face the music.   P/s : I hope he would change his mind.
