      I still am not sure what I am doing but since my other half isn't home I sit here at the computer in a weak attempt to ignore all the stuff I have to do for work this weekend.  And everyone thinks I get the summers off - but if everything goes right I should have July and August off - so Seitherin - run and hide here I come.  Or if you prefer we could meet at Never-Never Land in SM area and play.  Anyone want a kitten!!!!

      I am so tired of being allergic to stuff - something bit me on my hands, one foot, and my inner thighs. I can't stop itching - I have tried everything and nothing is working - Ihave blisters on my hand. The only thing that works is Rubbing alcohol and I can't figure out how to keep it on the skin til the pain goes away.  Very ANNOYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Finally got to see the movie Spiderman 2 - LOVED it. I cried, of course, at the sappy parts.          Also put one of the 3 shelves together. Will try to put the other 2 together tomorrow.          Went to Olive Garden for dinner after the movie with my hubbie. Good meal even though the waiters got a lot of stuff wrong. They put dressing on the salad after I specifically asked them not to. One of them took Joe's drink and never came back and we never got the extra bread we asked for. I could understand all of that but we were there earlier than the dinner crowd and there were plenty of waiters in the area.           Oh well - I am hoping to go see a movie this weekend or to see one when I get back. I am still planning on visiting my brother and sister in law. Hopefully I will get to see one of the kiddos also. It will be a nice break from doing nothing.          I have been soooooooooooooooo lazy. It I get one thing done in a day it's a miracle. And I still have 3 or 4 major things I want done before the end of August - oh well - we shall see we shall see - bye for now

Casper (approximately 4 months old     white male       Siamese - Amy's kitten)    (Both Amy and Casper       are a little     crosseyed but they have the       most     gorgeous deep blue eyes I have       ever    seen)            2.) My dogs are :             Lobo (10 to 11 year old Chow/Shar Pei mix = cream     colored =       eyes match fur) (My hubbie's    baby - very tolerant of       other animals)      Nessa (9 to 10 years old Chow/Shar Pei mix -     Lobo and Brandy's       daughter = Brandy died a    few years ago of heart problems      = although     her parents were both short haired = shel    ooks       like a full blooded Chow = fawn    colored) ( she prefers       cats to dogs but     will tolerate the little puppies)      Skeeter (approximately 4.5 year old black lab     mix) (he was       found on the side of the roadb    y my husband and well the       rest is history    as they say) ( he is a character and at           times can be a little cranky - there was    evidence of       abuse when we found him and     unfortunately some dogs we       had also abused     him)(We don't have those dogs anymore -       hea    dores the other dogs we have right now     and is       constantly cleaning them)       Piper (approximatley 5 to 6 years old chihuahua     found running       from a horse in the neighbors    pasture about 3 to 4 years       ago) (she could    have been the poster child for animal       abuse     when we found her - eyes crusted over;    sores on 90%       of her body; collar cutting     into her neck = I asked the       vet if we    should give her rabbies shots and he    responded       "Let's see if she lives first")     (We are often asked if       she was worth the    time     and trouble it took to get her       looking     this way = she's not the most beautiful dog    but       we love her = warts and all)       Bandit (age unknown - approximately 4 to 6 months old male chow       mix; found in our backyard area with a severe skin       problem = now gorgeous) (he is one of those dogs you can       seehim thinking when you talk to him) (he reminds me of      Brandy (not his mom)= we think we had to put his Mom to       sleep a few weeks before he showed up because she had       mange so bad it was already in her blood stream - luckily       he didn't have it.)       Nicky (a 3 to 4 month old female beagle mix = brown and white)       Josie ( a 3 to 4 month old female with some german shephard in       her maybe = might be Nicky's sister)(we found Nicky and       Josie in the neighbors field running from the street =       they may have just been dumped when we found them)(they       unfortunately like to play chase with the cats butthey       will back off if the cats pursue them and Smokie does)            AND if they weren't enough we have 23 goats and yes we have names for all of them.      Basically the males are : Daper Dan, Buster, Buddy, Dukie, Frankie, and Freddy      The females are : Grandma, Brownie, Andy's Mom, Buster's Mom, Floppy, A's Mom, Barb, Betty, Dottie, Debbie, DeeDee, Candy, Dana, Emily, and Baby (not really our goat but if she stays long enough we may wind up with her)            The goats tend to change so often that I probably won't list them all the time (at one point we had 51 goats). They are part of my husband's retirement fun.

        Well - that cinches it - the world is coming to an end. Here I am writing on this blog two days in a row.            I am suppose to be putting together three shelves but I am being a bum - besides I have to keep an eye out for the kittens. We are letting them outside with the new puppies and anyone who has ever had this many animals ( 7 dogs and 15 cats)knows things don't go smoothly. My little (LEO) - who has been one sick kitty since April = caught a baby bird this morning - needless to say the mocking birds are pissed - so was I. The last thing I need is for him to eat some raw bird and get sick again. I tried to rescue the bird but I don't know if it worked and I know NOTHING about Birds. So I set it free once I gotit out of his mouth and I went to check on it and it wasn't where I left it so MAYBE it's okay.So far the only thing that has gone right this morning is my internet connection miraculously got better.

        Well the phone line has been repaired but the internet connection is suckie. Anyhow I am really enjoying not working for the second half of the summer. Spent yesterday shopping with P.C. = bought myself 5 shirts and 3 pants for about $150 or less. Caught some good sales and was in the right mood. That rarely happens at the same time. I was even in the mood to try clothes on - people might want to take refuge somewhere = the sky will probably come falling down around me. After about 6 hours of shopping however I could not handle people anymore so we went back to my place and had our Sci Fi night. Dinner with my hubbie and watched stuff we have taped for the week.           Hubbie and I were suppose to be in Austin but postponed til August - however I am going to go see my brother and his wife next weekend in that area just for fun. Gotta spend the rest of my money from my share of the summer checks. Still looking for homes for the kitty cats but we are letting them outside for a little while each day and trying to teach the puppies to leave them alone.           Goats are doing good but one of them did almost brake her foot by getting it caught in a tree branch the other day. She has recovered mostly but still a little tender on the leg.          I am looking forward to having some down time with myself when I get back from my brothers. I have several meetings in August but they should be laid back meetings mostly.       Anyhow more later.

      Okay my house phone is dead again for the umpteenth time this year and so I can't get online except at work. Also I called the phone company and told them my husband would be home and they are suppose to send someone out between 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. - only I forgot to tell my husband to leave his cell phone on just in case they call and the last time I called the house and his cell - neither was working or on. SO we will see how long it takes them to fix it this time. It dies when it rains (no rain lately). It dies when the mowers go through and run over the phone cover thingy sticking out of the ground (we painted it bright red and they stopped running it over). It dies when the ants get into the mechanisms outside (so far no signs of ants in the pants). Oh well - guess I will have to wait for it to get fixed.   Spent part of the day trying to help out a friend with her house cleaning and sorting. She is older and has lost control of the entire house and boy can I sympathize with that. Only difference is my house is smaller and hers is more interesting to sort. More later.

      I spent some time with my best friend recently and really had a great time. We did what we usually do - eat, watch movies, shop at book stores, and talk. We met over twenty five years ago quite by chance. We both hung around the Math department at the University we attended. She had a crush on a friend of mine and I had a crush on a guy she knew in the department. I wanted to go to lunch withthe guy I had a crush on and he didn't have time so I looked over at her and said something to the effect of "Want to go eat? I am hungry and I hate eating alone." She looked at me and said "Sure, Why not?" And we have been having lunch ever since. We had seen each other at the department and at a few parties of mutual friends but nothing had developed before that lunch. As a matter of fact we went to high school together for about 5 months and even saw each other at a play that some mutual friends were involved in. We both took an instant dislike of the other. Then two years later we had lunch together and she has been my best friend ever since.   Even though I had another friend for most of my childhood - I never knew what a best friend really was til I met her. No matter how long we have been apart - when we get together it feels like no time has passed. At least that is how I feel. Well I am getting too mushy and I can just hear her saying "alright - enough of the mushy stuff". SO that's it for now. More later I hope

      It is so hard to try to write something intelligent with a kitten eating your feet.  I have 7 kittens in a 16 by 80 trailer and all are asleep but the one named Roddick who is biting my legs.  I am use to them helping me type on the computer or sleeping on my hands while I attempt to answer email but this is a new experience.    He keeps going back to the legs.  He won't stay in my lap or lay on my hands - he wants to chew me up.  And before you suggest buying a chew toy there are several lying around the house but he is ignoring them.   I got a comment from someone recently and it reminded me how much I miss writing poetry and short stories.  So since I have the second half of the summer off = I am going to give it another try.   Anyhow I am still getting use to this idea of writing online where others can see it as well as me.  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

      Well I just finished "The Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold = I started it yesterday morning and finished it this morning.  I could not put the book down but I can't for the life of me explain why I couldn't stop reading it.  It is a narrative from the point of view of a 14 year old girl who is murdered.  She watches her family and her murder from heaven while trying to understand why she died.   It is mesmerizing.  The last book to do this to me was called "The Living Blood" by Tananarvie Due.  Totally different stories but both caught my attention and never let go.  I got the book at my best friends suggestion = thanks!  I have finally had a summer where I could read but this was by far my favorite book this summer.  I have also read "The Cabinet of Curiosities" and "Still Life With Crows" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child = they also wrote "The Relic" = BOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.  Now I need to find at least 3 other books that I started months ago but lost the book and where I was in them.   Well it's late and I am tired = so more later.

Nessa (10 year old chow) is scheduled for surgery for tomorrow to have a tumor removed.  spent weekend playing diablo online with brother = really enjoyed that = hope i can find time to do it again.  need to try and get serious about doing some work before school starts - so much to do and so little interest in it = i want to retire now!  more later.
