        Do you remember     The first time we met?     The first time I saw you--     I'll never forget.          Your vision was cloudy,     The tears in your eyes.     I gazed on in silence,     As we looked to the skies.          It's hard to forget you,     Hard as I try.     I ask the same questions     Whenever you come to mind:          Why aren't you here, now?     Why don't you return?     There's so much to teach you--     And so much to learn.          You turned to me sadly,     And asked for my name.     I felt I should tell you,     And did, just the same.          I could sense your innocence,     Your inner beauty, clear.     My heart, it beat wildly     Everytime you came near.          I want to forget     Your kind, sweet face.     But my fondest memories     Are impossible to erase.          And then there are times     When I know you are near.     I whisper your name,     Expecting you to appear.          But you choose to stay hidden,     You chose to forget.     Did you feel nothing special     The first time we met?          I've returned to that spot,     I've gazed at the skies.     I've remembered the clouds--     And the tears in your eyes.          ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        Looking, but never really seeing,     Touching, but never really feeling,     Hearing, but never really listening to me,     These are the ways you have let me down.          My love, a deep and powerful desire for you,     My dream, a wish for us to be together always,     My soul, crying out for your attention,     These are the ways that I loved you.          But, you coldn't see that desire,     You couldn't feel that wish,     You couldn't listen to my soul's plea--     And so these are the ways      I must say goobye.          ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        A darkened flame,     A dimmed twilight,     A forceful quarrel,     A wronged right.          A stifled cry,     An imaginary real.     A crowded abyss,     A mistaken feel.          A crossed line,     A world of grey.     A closed door,     And hell to pay.          A withered rose,     A broken word.     A joyless song,     Left yet unheard.          A teary farewell,     A world fallen apart.     These are the words     Of a broken heart.           ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        The hair, the fire-colored hair,     That stretches down beyond the waist;     The skin, chocolate-colored brown,     Contrasts beautifully with the face.          The eyes, two emeralds that light the face,     The sparkle, glittering in the eyes.     They dazzle, giving the features grace,     Reflecting the crescent moon in the skies.          The smile, warm, fantastic, alive,     Add light and beauty to thy name.     To weaken all, the expression seems to strive,     And put the shimmering stars to shame.          The attire, seemingly shadowed in the twilight,     Lets it be cloaked in night.     Those eyes, seeking the other's light,     Those emeralds, that captures the other's sight...          ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        Do you care?      I'm sitting here, crying over you.      Do you care?      I don't think I can go on without you.      Do you care?      I cannot face the world without you.      Do you care?      I think that I may die without you.      Do you care?      I'm lying here, dying over you.      Do you care?      ...I think that I still love you...            ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        A sweet serenity,  An unnerving calm.  A peaceful tranquility,  An unearthly song.   A deafening silence,  A crowded clear.  An impossible reverance,  A shrouded tear.   A mystery to the heart,  A fallen might.  A lightness of soul,  A brightness of night.   A peace that is brought  To the heart, spirit and mind--  For all those who seek it,  I hope, someday, you find.   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru
