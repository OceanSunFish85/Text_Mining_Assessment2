      "The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain."  "The path of a relationship with true love is like a trip together down an old dirt path in the woods - sometimes it'll be beautiful and easy, other times it will be a rough walk with its ups and downs, turns and twists. But when you think you're out of the woods and you look back, you are glad the journey took place, and in all, you are glad you and your special someone took it together. But the journey is not over, you have only just begun. So, don't loose faith; keep on walking. If your love is true, the path you two take will never end."

      Baby,I knew you need the time to think and I shouldn't disturb you...But I feel like telling you sooooo much.....I've grown up....Suddenly I really feel I've grown...Someone whom you know too ask me along to Malaysia with her alone for a trip..She wanted to take a break as she was, too, facing alot of problems...At first I was quite alright with the trip but on second thought,I really start to think about you....Although you are still deciding and the outcome may not be what I want...I feel I din't want you or anyone to get worry about me...If I were to go,I definitely will inform you but to think back again,by informing you will again make you worry too....I decided not to go..I feel if one wants to cool down,it can be anywhere and not necessary to malaysia..And I thought she may not be in the right mind now and the more I shouldn't get influence by her..I decided I shouldn't go..coz truthfully,I didn't want anyone to get worry about me..She told me she may go alone instead...I didn't know what to say but to tell her,dun get anyone worry for you..coz I made that mistake and I may not be given a chance anymore..So,I'm not making the same mistake ever again coz it's far too high price to pay for it..How I wish you will know.....and give me a chance again.....anyway....I will wait..love you always...
