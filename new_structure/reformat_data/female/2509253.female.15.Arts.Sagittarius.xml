       A Telephone Call that Changed my Life       The night was cold and I was sitting in my bedroom, reading my once favourite book by Nicholas Sparks. I have read it for more than three times already. It was not as if I have a choice to do whatever I want after having a heated argument with my father.     Suddenly the telephone rang and to my immense relief, it was a call from mother. I asked her if she had a good day and then complained to her about fatherâs unreasonable attitude, however I could sense that she was not really interested in my conversation so I asked her if she was alright. âDaughter, I have decided to leave the family and Iâve already booked a one way ticket to Europe. I shall be staying at a friends house. Please inform dad about this and take care of the family for me dear.â With these words from my mother, I found myself at a complete loss for worlds as I felt as though my whole world had just collapsed. I was filled with remorse and the fact that I was totally unprepared for such a situation made me scared. I could not hold down the sorrow and a scorching stream of tears began to flow down my cheeks. I went into the bathroom and locked myself inside for the next half an hour. When I regained my composure, I began to question myself what had affected mother so badly that she had to leave our family. Minutes drift pass and eventually the answers shot at me like bullets. Our family consists of father, me, and my two brothers. We lived in a big house but have never hired a maid, mum had to clean the house everyday and she never fail to cook us our favourite meals every evening. Father was a workaholic who comes home from business trips only for sixty five days in a year. Mother must be lonely and tired of nagging at us without our least efforts to change for the better. Occasionally she even received cold shuns from my brothers. My heart palpitated wildly as I thought of the consequences without mum around the house, taking care of our needs. My brothers are always quarrelling with each other over minor things and they never got along well. Father did not have a close relationship with us due to his constant business trips, he was absent from all our major graduations or birthday celebrations, unlike mother.  I stared at my distraught face in the mirror and wished that it was all a terrible nightmare. The telephone call on that fateful night indeed changed my life. The beginning of my misery.
