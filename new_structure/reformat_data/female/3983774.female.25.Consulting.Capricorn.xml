      Well it't coming to the end of another long day. I guess I decided to come on here because I found a few minutes in my day to put down my thoughts. I have a lot of things going on in my head. I haven't really taken the time to come here since I signed up. So there is a lot of catching up to do.   This weekend was an interesting one. Ever since my boyfriend and I broke up, I guess my life has gotten a little bit busier. I guess God has away of filling up your time so you don't become idle, which will usually get you into trouble. I went out with one of my good friends this weekend,we had a good time. Wow some of the people and things you can see downtown. I like going out just for the laughs.   So my boyfriend and I have broken up now for about 3 weeks. It's hard for me because I love him so much but I really think we need this. We both have hopes of being back together but I know God has a lot of work to do on me before I can truly commit myself to anyone. We just going into this vicious cycle of breaking up and getting back together. I decided I really need to stay focused this time and not get comfortable with him when I see him or talk to him because that is what I know. Whenever we go through these break up phases and I stick to my guns he starts talking marriage or living together. It drives me insane. When we are together he isn't happy with certain things about me. But when we are not together he starts talking about stuff that would mean we would be together for the long haul. I wish he would get it togher. Well this is to be continued because the title of this message was concerning a completely different subject so I will have to finish that topic at a later date.

      Wow this is exciting . This is my first time ever doing this. One of my girlfriends  urlLink  Legally Purple   told me about it. She is really creative and always knows about the stuff no one has ever heard of. I am at work now, doing exactly what I am not supposed to be doing. Not working.    I guess as you can tell by my title that I am a Wedding Planner (I prefer the name Professional Bridal Consultant but ever since that movie with J Lo, Wedding Planner just sounds catchier). I spend most of my days doing that but I have a job that pays my salary which I rarely do. That is so sad. I always get my work done but I love doing my passion and until I can get that company on it's feet I will be working for THE MAN.   The name of my company is  urlLink  WEDDING FOR 2  . It was started by a fellow church member of mine and soon after I came on board. We have been trying to raise this baby ever since. It is a lot of hard work starting your own company. I love it though. I don't think I would want to do anything else.   Well, I really should be getting back to work. Thanks for telling me about this Netta.
