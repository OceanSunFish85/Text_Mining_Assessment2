      Well, it wasn't exactly my party last night at the NBC Tent. But, heck it was the last event of Momentum that I attended before finally flying to Bangkok. I will definitely miss Momentum. Here we are in full force at the event.     In photo are Toti, Randy, Rudy, Me, Ichi, Alma, Chuva, Karen and Arvin   With my immediate boss, we call him "Tito Ruds" (pronounced witha slang shala colegiala tone)      And how timely, here's Rachel Alejandro singing "Paalam Na"...

      From college...  I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.   From my first job...  I've learned that your life can be changed in a matter of minutes by people who don't even know you.   From Events Circuit/ MME...  A lot actually!  I've learned that you can keep going long after you think you can't.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel.  I've learned that either you control your attitude or it controls you.  I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.  I've learned that sometimes the people you expect to help you get back up when you're down may be the ones that are there to kick you down further.  I've learned that even if you do the right thing for the wrong reason, it's still the wrong thing to do.  I've learned there is very little you can control except your attitude.  I've learned that knowing when to let go is just as important as knowing when to hang on.  And most importantly, I've learned that you should determine your response to temptation before it arrives. And then act on it.   From leaving Events Circuit/ MME...  I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.  I've learned that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.  I've learned that life doesn't turn out like we want it to but making the most of how it turns out is the best way to be happy.   Now withMcCann...  I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.  I've learned that sticking to my values doesn't make the road easier, but it has made a stronger person.  I've learned that time heals all and from every frustrating experience on eventually finds humor.     From loving a friend who turned out to be gay...         I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.    All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them.     I've learned that no matter how much I care,    some people just don't care back .    From my true friends...     I've learned that true friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance.

      A friend emailed me and I just want to share it with you. This struck me and affirms the message God's been telling me lately and maybe just let go of my bitterness...  You're On The Look Out For A Significant Other?    Everyone longs to have a deep soul relationship with   another and to be loved thoroughly and exclusively.   But God says: "No, not until you are satisfied,   fulfilled, and content with yourself totally and   unreservedly to Me, discovering that only in Me is   your satisfaction to be found, will you be capable   of the perfect human relationship that I have   planned for you.    Stop planning, stop wishing, and allow Me to give   you the most thrilling plan - one that you cannot   imagine.    I want you to have the best.    Please allow Me tobring it to you.    You just keep watching Me,   expecting the greatest things.    Keep listening to what I tell you.   Don't be anxious. Don't worry.    Don't look atthings others have.    Don't look at the things youthink you want.    Just keep looking at Me,    or you'llmiss what I want to show you.    And then, when you're ready,    I'll surprise you   with a love far more wonderful than    any you would dream of.   Until you are ready and until the one I have    foryou is ready - until you are both satisfied   exclusively with Me and the life I prepared for you -    you won't be able to experience the love that    exemplifies your relationship with Me,    and this is the perfect love!   But then again, I may just be totally bored to be reading and then posting this.  Do you honestly think that I believe any of these???

       I don't really know when I'm leaving for Bangkok.  I haven't booked the plane tickets yet. But it will definitely before Aug. 9 (because that's the day when I start working!). I'm still here at McCann until Friday, July 23. Until then, I will just keep killing time doing my Blog, and maybe attend a couple of client meetings, pretend to work by looking at my desktop the entire day...

      Now that I will be leaving my Momentum family in 3 days, I can't help but reminisce all the fun moments we had...    I remember when we dressed-up for Halloween.  I came in my usual self - A WICKED WITCH.       We went to Baguio for the Enduro San Mig Light Adventures.  It wasn't really my project, butArvin andI joined anyway - bunch of free loaders!  hehehe... we went there for the ever famous ukay-ukay!      In photo: Celine Lopez, Munik Manalo, Alma Francisco, Arvin Zapanta, Vim Sto. Domingo, Rudy Villar       TheSan Miguel Strong Ice Launch (not my project as well, but I joined for the free drinks!).       In photo:bunch of crazy drunks!      And of course, more drinking! Imagine how much fun I had in McCann!      In photo: Val Peramide, LaraGirl, Chuva Cruz     Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all "LASINGAN". May mga wholesome din naman! Oh, with Spidey!       Hay, super dami pa ng chika ko sa office. I will never forget these wonderful moments! Thank God again for Blog, I can share them with you!

       This is my family here in McCann.     It's my last work week. Today is the last Monday that I will go to my 34th floor office here at GT Tower. I'm starting to say goodbye to the great people I have work with.   And starting to pack my stuff! Can you imagine all my trash...gosh.  Cleaning never ends! I have thrown away a total of 2 garbage bags and my desk is still a complete mess!

              I'm sure you'll agree. Here's a before and after shot with my dear friend, Arvin.      We thank God for make-up!       Sorry girls, but Arvin is gay and taken!

      I'm not really doing anything important these days. Just slacking... And thank God for the Blog! I have something to kill my time other than friendster.

      Oh, it's 20 days to go before I finally leave for Bangkok. I can't really tell if I'm excited or scared. What the fuck, I have never been alone in my entire life! I will surely miss all my friends and family. Fucker, no love life to think about??? Oh, well. Maybe it's there. True love may be waiting at the airport, or at mbk or petchburi... but I sure hope that I don't find him in Pat Pong (it's the sleazy district).

      Yuck! What a headline.  Anyway, I'm finally here.  Working with Thais. It's my first day at work so I don't really have much to do except familiarize myself with the company.   Yesterday, I watched a movie all by myself.  And I'm pretty sure it won't be the first one. Wish my friends were here... especially my movie buddy...Jeng.

      It's only now that I realize that I'm good at this, especially to my family.  The morning when I left the house, I casually just said bye to my family like I was just going on an out-of-town trip or worse, like I'm just going to the mall.  I kept the pain inside me. You will not believe how hard I kept my tears from flowing... I have always been a strong person.  Good thing, I came prepared. I wore sunglasses. And underneath it were my red, teary eyes. No one saw it. I always like being in control and breaking down in tears is a total no-no. And so I went to the airport, checked in... and then, there I was standing in line at the gates, with tears streaming down my face (and I really mean STREAMING, not my usual drama when "a tear fell"). I couldn't help it. I texted friends, and the more messages I received, more tears came flowing. There were friends who called me, and I fought back the tears again. I couldn't bear them hear that I was actually crying.  Moments before boarding, I just had to call someone, a friend whom I can actually cry to. And so I did. I adore Jeng. And I think she cried as well. I recover easily you know. I even managed to take a picture of myself at the airport, trying to smile.
