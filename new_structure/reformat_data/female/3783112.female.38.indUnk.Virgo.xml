      after you get the first sting, you're addicted, so they say. i guess that's true. i guess that's exactly what i needed, something to look forward to, something to give me the pleasure of antecipation, something to help me through july. that's good when the aching is deep, but the surface must remain undefiled. thank you. p.s. I: this is not meant as apology of legal or illegal drugs; there are endogenous drugs that can be produced by our own mind; careful, though; they're as much as powerful, and can be as much as devastating... p.s. II: i guess that's another extended pms.

      newly born and changed already. to get more like myself. been changing so fast for so long that i'm exausted. guess i'll never stop spinning. the only unchangeable thing in the universe is change itself, says the wiseman... there's no such thing as eternal rest. eternal movement made of spirals of time that toss you around, and, now and then, allow you short pauses, to share a kiss, eat a piece of chocolate, write a song, shed a tear. my pause is over for now.

      so, i've gone public ... sudden block out ... exposure is hard.  i hope i'll get used to speaking out, that's a good first step if i intend to sing out very shortly. i'll take my time (though it's getting shorter by the hour...); maybe bring my songs in... that's all i can do for now.

      things keep on changing. i just decided to get loose and go with the flow. perhaps i got  too  loose, because now i can't get myself to do the things i have to do.  "buried in piles of paper, cuffed to my chair".  i should be working right now, although it's actually almost 7 p.m. here.   this emotional whirlwind is good for writing songs, though. the melodies have been coming to me first, butthe words are not so easy to be born.   i'm just exausted.   even though there are hundreds of people a couple of clicks away, the profiles seem to keep me away from them, and them from me. either they're too young, or too old, or unatractive somehow, and, bottomline,everyone is judging everyone, enhancing the sense of isolation.  como diria minha amiga Ju, "como Ã© difÃ­cil lidar com os humanos..."  whatever.

      i hope it's the last entry about this subject. i managed to see another doctor, a dermathologist, that same day; she confirmed the infection and, as the anaesthesia had no effect, she cleansed my ear in cold blood, squeezing and taking the suppurated material with nippers; i felt like William Wallace under torture. wide range antibiotics, anti-allergics (i have a feeling this word is all wrong), an ointment, i could finally sleep, the pain is gone, i have my ear back. she said i may be allergic to the pigment in the tattoo paints (not mentioning the contamination of the paint, sometimes people use the same tube for many clients...), so i may never have a tattoo, too. that's sad, they're an important part of my transformation in myself. whatever. anyway, i'm not feeling an outcast: 90% of the piercings go wrong. a tribe to belong to, the "absolute non-pierced".

      apart from being really stupid , now i find time to feel freaking scared. the doctor said that i have go on antibiotics (because my ear is red and it has a big blister, what indicates the presence of infection by bacteria) or my ear will necrosate (and i don't know if this verb exists in english), meaning  rot  and i don't trust her because she was really mean and unsimpathetic, and i'm trying to see another doctor, oh-my-mother-earth-what-the-fuck-i-have-done. all i wanted was this little ornament in my ear. fuck.

      well, i had to take the piercing off. it turned out that i had a strong reaction to the nikel in the metal alloy (although it was surgical steel),my body would keep on trying to expel the jewel, and i would keep on being in rather unbearable pain.  if  i decide to try again, it'll take three months, a titanium jewel, and a lot of getting over the traumaof three days of endless pain. i wonder what lesson i'm supposed to learn from this (taking into account that i believe that everything that happens to me, good or bad, somehow i deserve). all i can think about (apart from the fact that i'm allergic to nikel) is, well, it's hard to become what you are, it's hard to make your outside match your inside. also, i have this way of making things the hard way, this pattern, this mental and emotional program that lead me tomake things difficult for myself, in every level of existence, and then cry out "oh, WHY ? it's so unfair!",so drama queen i can hardly stand myself.i want to stop making things more difficult than they're supposed to be. i want to break the pattern. i want to be free. i want to write the music that comes through me. i want to be happy. as every child of the stars is meant to be.

      i had my left ear pierced last saturday. according to my three-day rule (my body reacts to antigens three days after the exposure), the reaction to this strange object in my body started today. it hurts like hell! i'm under painkillers right now. my ear is almost purple and rather swollen; no disgusting fluids, thanks to the Goddess. working was hard today, i tried vulcan meditation (the mind is stronger than the pain), but the mind was not working well today. no regrets, though (yet...), i hope the bad part passes soon. i wonder what part of the energy meridian i'm blocking or stimulating. i hope everything is ok. the next step is the tatoo.

        harvest   is the third album-to-be by   portal  . the setlist is not defined yet, that's why there's a question mark. it's also a phase i'm going through, but it's about things that didn't happen yet (not in this life) or may happen in the future. do i make myself clear?

      well, i guess the best way to publish my lyrics is one by one. i tried editing the  lyrics  post to include more songs, but i never get the blog thoroughly updated. maybe one by one will be better, i can find lyrics by the title. i'll think it over.

        man!!??!!   one of those days you wish you had stayed in bed! family... no matter how old you are, if you pay your own bills, if you live miles away, this energy, this  scent , it reaches you and makes you feel down, all that crap you grew up with comes back to haunt you... fuck! and work... days like these make you feel like you were caught in the middle of a spider web, this net of litlle powers layered upon each other, and you just want to  fucking work  to earn the devil's gold that i'll keep you alive at some level of decency. why on earth should your computer  freeze  just when you need it the most, in a day like this? i need boxing classes! know for how long i've been trying to publish this very post? aaarrrrgggghhhhh!

      i decided to publish some of the lyrics of the songs i wrote. i resumed writing songs on a regular basis about a year ago. i call it   the awakening  , this phase i went through (also the title of the first album-to-be by   portal  ): end of a long term relationship, the most public drunk shame, new job, new friends, new post graduation, new looks ... there's a second album-to-be already planned:   exposed   , which is exactly the phase i'm going through by now. i haven't decided if the lyrics will be organized by album or in cronological order of creation, i'll make it up as i go along.

      i'm working on a  read first  message about author's rights concerning the lyrics of my songs and trying to learn how to insert it into the blog, as a link or something (i live in a self-imposed digital exile, so this is my first experience on the net). it'll take some time because i'm really busy, so this is a preview:    portal   is the name i chose for my band-to-be; i searched the net some time ago, there were not many  portals , and just one brazilian band called  portal do sol  or something like that and they did  axe music  or  pagode , nothing like i intend for my band (which is rock, by the way, something between  dave matthews band  and  korn , passing through  pearl jam  ... whatever). please, don't use it!  my lyrics are protected by author's right ( droit d'auteur ), which is the system of legal protection in civil law countries which subscribed the union convention of berna (1886), according to which the act of registration is  declarative  of the existing right.  my lyrics, although not registered in any national or international organization of property rights, are also protected by  copyright , which is the system of legal protection in common-law countries which subscribed the universal convention, according to which the act of registration (since 1976) is also  declarative , not  constitutive , of the existing right.  all this means that the lyrics were written by me and cannot be used for commercial purposes without my authorization and the due payment of  royalties .  if you want to use them, ask me!  if you want to quote them, make a reference to the source (after all, that's what  quoting  means...)!  please, don't abuse them ( i'll sue you )!

      so now i discover that writing in lower case is bad... after all the work of deliberately taking the upper case format from all the "i"... . maybe i can be excused for taking the liberty, because i'm not a native speaker (though that's not really the reason why i do it). does it really bother anyone (else)? sorry, but that's my way. the web is supposed to be a democratic forum, where freedom of speech and expression can be put into practice. there are worse things to worry about on the net, things that can be harmful to people's minds and spirits. but the question is, who sets the rules? who controls the controller ? i believe there's a common sense, a sense of what is good, that is above all the differences. this sense tells me, that "lower case x upper case" issue is too small to bother. but i bothered to write about it, so let me be beaten. for that.

      i finished posting my lyrics today, finally. feels a little like delivering a child (though i've never gone through the experience in this life) ... now they're out there. looking forward to writing the next forty. it seems like they're not as many as they should be considering the time it took me to write them. but they mean a lot, they're parts of me, layers of skin.

        barely living   (by deav) Rio, Jul 2004 (?)  wake up, the clock is ringing stand up, the room is spinning back down, itâs there, but i canât see the sun  eight minutes more, the clock is snoozing, i get up again eyes blurred, i stand up and just stumble on  i canât see my face, hidden by scrambled hair in sleepy confusion, yawning, i mumble iâm barely living  one hour to get ready and leave, twenty minutes to get there where i am, yet i am not  feel like a ghost, a lost soul things flow like in slow motion feel like a fish inside a water bowl  night falls, all the way back knowing tomorrow will be the same, head on the pillow i wonder iâm barely living  *   *   *

        this   (by deav) Rio, Mai 2003  (exposed)   just as weâd started feeling comfortable in each others arms putting aside the knowledge of the parting hour getting by daring to choose the names of the children weâd make together that was sweet, but we had to go  soon thereâll be an ocean between us itâs sad but soon everything but the memories, will fade away, even those, just until they start to hurt too bad then theyâll be gone hope a little bit of them remain enough to turn into a song or two in the years to come  think of all the things that never came to be weâre all in the hands of fate if i had just crossed a street i would have never seen your face i guess the timing was wrong maybe it wasnât meant to be, after all though it felt so strong what rises eventually falls at least we had this at least we had this that we had at least we had thisâ¦  *   *   *

        block   (by deav) Rio, Mai-Jul 2003  (exposed)   i was alive i was awake i was spinning âround dancing to my sound  i was drunk with joy i was drenched in hope I was emitting light holding life tight  yet there was a spot of shadow a drop of fear of what lied ahead after all, "happiness always ends" "thatâs the one thing you must understand"  what i feared most is taking place the shadow has wiped the smile off my face please donât let me be trapped inside again please donât let me live in never-ending pain  make it not beâ¦  iâve walked this path before thought what i was free for good i donât want to be alone anymore if you could save me i wonder if you would  what i feared most is taking place â¦  *   *   *

        bounce   (by deav) Rio, Mai-Jun 2003  (exposed)   sometimes i feel like a rubber ball bouncing from ceiling to floor and every wall body aching, broken head i wonder if i pass through the door iâll be run over and thorn  sometimes i feel like a dry rose leaf taken and carried by a raging wind thoughts spinning as i spin around i wonder when i get to the ground iâll be stepped upon in a moment so brief  wish i could only feel like myself if only i knew howâ¦  sometimes i feel like a seaweed floating through the shifting currents brought from the chasm by waves and torrents i wonder when i get to the shore iâll dry out and die under the sun  wish i could only feel like myself if only i knew howâ¦  *   *   *

        moon on the corner   (by deav) Rio,  Mai-Jun 2003  (exposed)   the days are heart-crushing whatâs the meaning of everything? what am i doing here if my will lies elsewhere?  the hours are longer but the sun is gone too soon i was getting stronger now i long for locking myself up in my room  i canât sleep i roll over i feel life is getting shorter the smoke whirls up and hides the moon on the corner  the nights are never long enough to make up for the time loss of the day when i finally turn off the other peoplesâ lives itâs tomorrow, today is yesterday  the hours finally weigh on my eyelids only thereâs no sandman song nightmares hurt only when i breathe i must be doing something wrong  i canât sleep i roll over i feel life is getting shorter the smoke whirls up and hides the moon on the corner  *   *   *

        traffic light juggler girl     (tljg)   (by deav) Rio, Abr 2003  (the awakening)   look at her sheâs throwing balls in the air sheâs not very good but she could be worse at her age this city is a circus but whoâs the clown here? whoâs the beast locked up in a cage?  you fear her youâd better do what harm could a child do? but her fear is bigger and itâs not of you but of the eyes that watch in a distance watching you too  youâre just passing by, acclimatized but she has to stay thereâs no way out for her only those that take her, stigmatized to dark alleys and stinking rooms  better stay under the three way lights like sad spotlights on an open stage to a show no-one stays long enough to watch  then the bride passes by in a metal chariot the closer to a fairy tale that sheâll ever get and in a magical moment they exchange tears and smiles and itâs just like theyâre just two girls, period  and the traffic light juggler girl watches as the dream goes other ways never to realize that a couple of crystals on the bridal gown could buy her food for a couple of days  and the flying balls fall downâ¦  (the fucking hypocrite who wrote this song but never did a single thingâ¦)  *   *   *

        ___/____/____ (march 2003)   (by deav) Rio, Mar 2003 (the awakening)  and the worldâs at war againâ¦ my daddy says the stupid ones do stupid things three times in a roll before they understand either thereâre too many stupid ones or their stupidity canât have an end  so the worldâs at war againâ¦ children will get motherless again and die alone flowers will be stepped upon the battle field and be soaked up with tears and blood exchanging human lives and souls for little drops of black gold  so i ask, why? weâre all together on the same old blue balloon floating in the endless space thereâs nowhere else to escape  so the worldâs at war againâ¦ while they drop the bombs from high above they cannot see the enemyâs eyes âcause if only they could theyâd see beyond the color of the skin and the way he worships god that heâs just another man a brother in the universal home  so i ask, why? weâre all together on the same old blue balloon floating in the endless space thereâs nowhere else to escape  *   *   *
