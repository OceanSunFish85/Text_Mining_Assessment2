      Uhh...today is my last day to rest,cos tomorrow i start working lor... Some how today get rabbit' sis call me for lunch n go JJ lepak. Today i feel so lucky day, cos buy everything cheap cheap one. Another thing make me happy is the phone call from Clara Beautician!! She call me for contract employment for abt 2 mth,so sorry i cant get the offer. I oso dont like the interviewee attitude,remember last time i go for the interview. She is so 'LCLY', she say to me if u r beautician i can offer u RM1500++. Then she said nowadays office work is no used n no value at all. Office work is so cheap, n ask me better go back home town if not i cant survive at kl. Today wen she call me, she ask me whether being emplot o not, she have great offer to me. Heh~~I tell her i have advance course to take at full time n not decide to work lor... She sound like not happy,cos she say i cant survive if i didnt get a job. Wen u find job,never let those 'hidung tinggi' ppl mark u as the stupid fresher n 'eat' ur price. During interview,she suddenly recommend their product n say how gd is it. U know by the time she giv tat beauty intro to me,i m looking her face. My heart think tat:"Wat a wrinkle n not elastic face,how u persuade ppl to buy~~~" Anywhere hope tat tomorrow is the lucky day lor...Kambateh!!

      If u had been there b4 u wil find out that this mamak stall is very success. The famous food likes Naan, bbq burung kecil, tosai and others. The seat is circle around the shop, and many leng lui n liang chai go there. Excluded us like the animal run out from the cage. I personally like the âCheese Naanâ n the the ais there oso tasty. Every time we went there must sit n have a long talk, we r so talkative. The boss knows speak mandarin n Cantonese, he act like the magician wen bill. He has his own skill by used of his hand to check whether the cash is real o notâ¦â¦ Coolâ¦u knows!! Steady n like magicianâ¦

      Do u all know tat at Ampang Park there have a great food stalk start biz at the early morning until noon only. At the Ampang area there have a very famous food Of âYong Tao Fuâ!! The location is near the Ampang Point there, the most famous and cook tasty food is located at the area. They have 2 shops commence biz beside each other, but they have their own secret recipe to cook the food.  The 1st shop has variety of choices and not only âYong Tao Fuâ.  U can have the meal like Asam Laksa Fish, âYong Tao Fuâ, âbeggar chickenâ, sizzling and fried food. They provide many choices depend on the food u like. The 2nd shop is the very traditional Yong Tao Fu n has many years of experience n cook in traditional recipe. The choices of the Yong Tao Fu really have many choices from the fried, soup cooking, braise, brew and others. And one thing u find out special in this shop is â¦If u have went âRedboxâ before u find out the servant there used the mic to pass order o even the Burger king. Here alsoâ¦.hahahaâ¦once the kitchen is ready the food for serve up table,the chief wil use the mic to call theirs servant to pick up the food for customers. Sound like:âTable 12 have order 10 pieces of Yong Tao Fu, Please served now!!â I know this place once we skip the class n go there to eat the tasty food there. I like the place but I think must have car is better n convenience to go there. The price is fair dealing n not so expansive, if have the time I wish to go there one more time lorâ¦

      One of the great food stalk in KL...i think is Jalan Alor. No matter in the morning until the evening. At the morning...i think only the early bird can make it... Cos i find out one shop sell claypot seafood food. The shop is very unique...y??Once u reach the shop u wil c the words "Only one shop dont have any branches" Another unique sign is they introduce their meal by writing in the poem. The price per bowl is not expansive,everyone is affordable. I like the meatball n the 'shui jiao'. Very big n tasty,RM0.70 each...especially the meatball is handmake. N the nite market at there oso...... I like there very much... Remember last time i went there is wen i m so sick...my fren bring me there eat n go to c doctor. Before i m so sick,after eat the food there i feel better...Then i tell them no need to c doctor lor...Cos i afraid to c doctor!! Who know the next day i m serious sick...my face white like paper n my lips become green. My housemate is frightened...n quickly bring me c doctor... Lastly,no matter i m sick o not i oso go there to have the great taste food!!

      I so afraid that i m easily get headache n south throat. Today i really not feeling, dont know whether is my job o my brain is oredi stuck now n can even have the answer that i want it now!! I really have to attend sth like the English class to upgrade myself ndont the chance for other to say i m so poor in English. But i really dont have the time n the problem i face in my job is...i didnt get the motivation n inspire spirit to perform my job well. Start fm 2nd week i always ask myself...am i suit for this job? Then 3 rd week i start to face the office political. How can?!I havent pass by the one month in this job n i already meet all those problem! B4 that i have other diff field of part time work,n imeet many ppl... But in this place i juz can say those ppl also act like 'small ppl' but the diff is they used their high educated knowledge to step on the headon the 'young bird'. As a conclusion,Malay ppl is really very nice n always ready to giv u a hand to help n take care of u...Until now i always help by theMalay ppl,although they didnt have high education...but they have their gentle n kindly attitudes to treat u like their fren n not enemy. Unless they know the freshes have the problem in new environment n always motivate u how to face it...That why i being confuse whether to leave or not...Hmmm

      Dont know why,tis July i felt so hard to pass the time. N i always repeat to ask myself wat the ppl i wish to be n now... i make the big decision for now...i want to quit! In my plan i hope i can get the job wch allow me to further other field of study. Cos as generally office working time is 9am-5pm. I oredi plan to take course at 6pm-9pm at systematic. But now i cant,cos always start work at 8.15am-9pm. And make me dont have the time to do other thing n the task is not innovative n inspire. I m so felt up the perception of those ppl i meet,n my 1st sense tell me tat i not even have the motivation to work in this kind of environment. So i try my best to survive in kl n get the other job b4 i really have to giv notice to tis co. Hope i have make the rite decision n not b'cos of my childish emotion.

      I always easily get headache,but today is b'coz of thinkin wat kind of digital cam is worth to buy. I think i cant b tat rush without survey of the px n buy it immediately. So i decide wait for next week end go Sg, wany there to cont my survey process. The worst thing isi m so out of knowledge in the selection of those hi-tech equipment. Like my notebook,i survey n asking others n take 2 years time to decide wch brand is worth to buy,luckily now stil perform very well. But my printer is too bad,juz used for 3 months only then problem occured n i force to buy another one...... I really fell headache wen have to decide for buy those thing!!

      Hmmm,i m so glad tat can go to the mini concert of FIR. I like to hear for live of those great singer o band performance. From the nite i start to admire how cool of Ah Qing performance n he is so attractive wen he play electronic guitar...... I reach there at 9p.m.,tis is the 1st time i attend in late,wah!!!many ppl juz more than last time i go to c Energy n Machi. I think tat Malaysia ppl is nothin to do,once the artist is come they wil always appear many ppl n so frightened,more ppl is not a bad news...but sometimes there wil b so crazy until someone is hurt n force the singer afraid to come out n cancel the show then...is not good lor!!! Altho i come late,but luckily still have the great place to view n take photo,i think mine one is not tat nice,but my other fren have,so i wait for them to pass Ah Qing pic for me...Hehehe...

Second person is my icq fren,happy tat he still borrow me the vcd drama,then i can have a nice weekend.  Thrid is the Nicole gal stuff sales gal,the indian gal is nice n good svc oso.   Bad people i meet today     Firstly is the carrefour promoter,i only buy table fan then he dont svc me n quickly go to other customer who buy microwave n rice cooker. But one thing is funny,if u wan to be the promoter of the electonic dept. U must have 'misai' n fat body n oso cury hair then u can be employ. Cos all of them is look like tat one...really standard like the 'SIRIM' mark for their eletrik.

      1st is the morning "cha guo's stalk",the aunt is very polite n gentle. She greet me morning n have a nice day...i m so surprise n juz smile to her only.  2nd is the lrt's security,once i reach the 'mountain ppl moutain sea'to take lrt. He walk around n warning those passenger be queue n care of ur own safety.  3rd thing i assume mayb happen in office,who noe today i bored at office n wan die.  Actually 3rd thing happen in lrt oso,a malay gal stand in front of me. She is crying n her fren try to calm down her n giv some advice to her. She cry n look like very sad...  Happiness is not always surround us,i think only the bad n sad thing will always accompany to grow up. Once u meet ur happiness never let it go tat easy,cos is too hard to get it. N for me i treat 'Happiness' as my treasure...

We born to bright up our life not to sit there n nothing to do n thinkin tat y my life is tat bored...... We make our life more means then waiting someone put u into the 'Happy Basket'! So i re-new the look of my room,hope can have a new inspiration n thinkin. Thing shd change,ppl can not always stand at the same point: change wen needed; change wen u stuck; change wen u bored; change wen u halfway wan to die; change wen u sad; change wen u lonely...... change watever u wish but never change the truth heart inside of u......

      y i say like tat...wan sth u wish to know,to meet,to ger,to have,to join n etc. U wil never make ur wish,but wen u give up all the wish... Then all the thing wil be appear n appear... Long long time ago,i wish to meet a guy in my living area,cos he live very near to my living area...but we never meet,n meet at college. Everyday wen i walk back to home i always wish i can meet him. Now i dont wan to c he face anymore,then tis few day we meet twice. Previous wen i saw his face fm far far away...i wil very heart attack one... But now wen i saw him i wil say "wat a bad day to meet him again"! I m a bad gal,so i m so alone now...n waiting for someone tat he never come back. i know he never come back,cos he imigrant to American...then i stil waiting him...mayb one day he may come back...we know each other for a long long time ago... So can i not to say tat the god juz kidding to u?! Wen i wish so its not dreams come true,wen i giv up then all the dreams is come true...but i dont have the heart to welcome its anymore...

      Today i m so busy n non-stop for doing my job. Until i left the office still left 7 more co. waiting for me to prepare the AGM doc. I m so sad tat i cant help my fren n resolve her upset n unhappy. She think she is buuly by the senior,but for me i dont think so. For her mayb a bit of hurt by those 'orang tua',wen she dont noe how to start a new job n those old ppl not teach her wat the whole procedure to do so...then die lor...she scold by the other dept. For me y i dont even think tat is hurt,cos mayb my skin is very thick n dont noe hurt gua...Or mayb i face many of tis kind of ppl. I hate ppl never think for the side of the shy n fresh workers po trainee. But sometime bully other act is needed once those ppl is very annoyed u n wit bad motive to treat u!Ha~~tis kind of ppl i half way wan to kill them. But juz kidding...i always bully by other,so i think i have the experience to handle it...n the same thing happen i wil take the chance to bully others.Hahaha........ Now i have the good idea,if once u wan to bully by ur bad ppl,u must at the same time bully by two bad ppl. WHY?Let say mr.A n mr.C at same time bully u,then u can used the act of Mr.A to stand wit Mr.C.(vice versus) So lonely tat no one chat wit me online,not even my icq fren n my fren study overseas. I m so alone,n dont noe how to entertain myself to happy n bright it up.......

      When you are together with that special someone,  you pretend to ignore that person. But when that  special someone is not around, you might look  around to find them. At that moment, you are in  love.   Although there is someone else who always makes  you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only  to that special someone. Then, you are in love.   Although that special someone was supposed to  have called you long back, to let you know of  their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are  desperately waiting for the call!  At that moment, you are in love.   If you are much more excited for one short e-  mail from that special someone than other many  long e-mails, you are  in love.   When you find yourself as one who cannot erase  all the messages in your answering machine  because of one message from thatspecial someone,  you are in love.   When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you  would not  hesitate to think of that special someone. Then,  you are in love.   You keep telling yourself, "that special someone  is just a friend", but you realize that you can  not avoid that person's special attraction. At  that moment, you are in love.   While you are reading this page, if someone  appears in  your mind, then u are in love with that person.

      In my office i think some unexpected problem arise always! Although not affect me but i treat those case as a reference for myself to be careful and used the proper way to communicate to people. The rice can let 100 kinds of people live in this planet,thus i think we should always be prepared will be faced those kind of 'Small People' at anytime and anyway. For my own point of view i think try to make urself happy and enjoy,if not life its not that easy to continue and survive...... I have the wish to travel and learn the diff living-style of diff country. The country i wish to go are: 1.   Japan      - Spring 2.   Taiwan     - Summer 3.   Canada     - Autum 4.   Korea      - Winter I wish one day my dream wil come true,dream always is the energy to push people towards and become more energetic.
