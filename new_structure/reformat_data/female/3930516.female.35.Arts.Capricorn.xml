      What a day.   Apparently I'm good at helping people.   I'm a bit bored of it.  OK, not completely. But there's so much of it. People being hospitalized. People getting separated. People being afraid. Everyone needs petting. And hand holding. And some of them deserve it and need it. Most of them? Do not. Making me completely crazy.  I guess I'm very lucky. I know that if I ever needed anything like a place to stay or a ride to the hospital or a thousand dollars to keep me and my baby alive (my fictional baby) I'd have more than one place to turn. And I'd probably have more than one person who could look at this situation and figure out how to make it better, how to make the worst not necessary. It turns out that most people don't have that. How is that possible?  But anyway, I'm home now. I can do stuff for my life and I don't have a mother and toddler living with me and no one is homeless or injured or dead. And tomorrow is another day.  And I have a blog. That's pretty cool. The novelty has certainly not worn off in the last 24 hours.  Hopefully soon I'll be able to bring the funny.

      Dear Big Cheese of Secretaries,  Here at Team Copoc we know that a job description is a jumping off place. The members have the opportunity to stretch their limits and use all of their skills. Sometimes ones we did not even know we had.  Given these wide parameters it is encumbent upon the members of the team both to explore our own boundaries and to know when our limits have been reached, for the good of the team.  Knowing this, it is time for me to bow out gracefully, for my own good as well as that of the team. Please let this serve as my resignation,  Perhaps in the future I can assist the team in another capacity.  Sincerely, The chick who is crying in the bathroom every day

      I'm working on a lot of things. One of them is just doing stuff. Not waiting until it's perfect. Not checking out all the angles. Trusting myself enough to know that if I want to do it then it's worth trying.  I've wanted a Blog for a long time. I waffle between thinking I'd be good at it and wondering why I'm so damned interested in the lives of people I've never met.    You know what? Everyone and their dog has a blog these days. If I like this I'll have 2 pretty soon. One for here and one for events that will link to my web site (www.ElizabethHRobinson.com). And, particularly for this one, it doesn't matter if I'm good at it. And, if all they say is true, I'll get better at it the more I try.   Right now, no one knows that I have this. At least for the next few minutes no one even has a way to search for me. So I can do whatever I want.    I'll post all sorts of stuff here. Stories and ramblings and opinions without back up and erotica and who knows what else. I have no idea where to start. So this is it. A start. A way to get over the first tough step.    We shall see what tomorrow brings.

      The time I sat on the steps outside 117 Hudson clutching a lamp and 2 bags and a chair, waiting for the car service with my ex-friend L. M was moving out of the NYC home of the company and everything that couldn't be moved was sitting out on the street. A pile of boxes and bags probably 12 feet long and 5 feet high at least. I don't remember what we were talking about, because what could we be talking about? Life as we knew it was moving. And this family comes along, 2 women and I think 2 kids, elementary school age. They saw the couch and the living room chair and they were considering taking them home. L and I, desperate for our surrogate home not to be thought of as useless and trashy, proceed to sell the items. Not for money, I mean, but tell that family how comfortable and how easy to carry. We go down to the enormous pile of life and find the bag with the cushions in it, help them figure out the load, offer to wait with any bits they can't carry until they can get back. And we watch as they wander away with the living room furniture.  Walking behind my married boyfriend and his wife in a crush of people walking back to Columbus Avenue from the Delacorte Theatre. Knowing that he knows that I'm there but knowing that he'll wig if I show myself and, more importantly, not knowing at all if the wife would recognize me if she saw me. At the time it was exciting and surreal. Thinking about it now, it's embarrassing and ridiculous.  The time that my grandmother died and my mom took her wedding and engagement rings and told me to put them in my pocket because she wanted me to have them but she had to take care of it with my uncle first. So later that night we're getting into the car. Uncle J driving, mom in the passenger seat and me behind her. So I'm sitting there and mom says, "J, I'd like Kizz to have mom's rings. I mean, after all, it might be the only diamond she ever gets." I'm sitting right there.  I got the rings.  I mean, who could have refused that pitch in honor of my pathetic loveless life. I didn't realize quite how pathetic and loveless until mom pointed it out. And I'll bet a dollar that if I told that story to my mom she'd tell me it never happened that way.

      I am not a step parent. So take my opinion for what you will.   Step parenting is the most thankless job under the whole umbrella of thankless jobs called Parenting.   You have to be positive about and deal civilly with a person or people that there's probably a very good reason your spouse left. You have to put the needs and wants of these children above those of your relationship and sometimes you have to let those kids go off with someone that you don't trust. Noteven a little bit. And you have to be pretty cheerful about it in the process.   "No, I don't hate your mom. I don't hate anyone. Sometimes I disagree with her, but that's to be expected."   You're the latecomer, you're the 5th wheel and yet you're also the glue, the brains and the heart of the operation.   While being a good parent and making decisions that kids may not agree with you still have to be the first to forgive and the first to give with people who don't love you and shouldn't be expected to, except that you've got to live together now. I mean, these kids didn't fall in love with you, they didn't decide they couldn't live without you. It's just another decision that they have no control over that affects every single moment of thier lives. Like getting assigned a roommate at boarding school. If boarding school were life long and your roommate dispensed your allowance, checked your homework and cooked all your meals.  "You're not my mom!"   Yet, you love them. Because you can't raise kids without loving them. At least not well. You want the best for them. You delight in seeing them grow into amazing human beings. You cry for their losses and you grind your teeth in frustration at their shortcomings.   And that is possibly the worst part of step parenting. If you didn't love them you could stop fighting the good fight, stop doing the right thing, walk away from the relationship. We've all walked away from a perfectly good romance when things got hairy, for our own good, for our sanity or for reasons much less clear and defensible. But, there are kids involved now, so if you're a step parent worth your salt (the salt ground into your wounds almost every day) you stay.   That's pretty fucking brave. Right on the cusp of stupid. But in a good way.   So, raise your glass to a step parent today. Then give your drink to them. They need it.

       Back at her apartment she pointed him toward the kitchen and went to change out of work clothes. She never knew what to do at times like this. Did you really slip into something sexy and let them know you wanted them or did you pretend this was a friendly get together? There was Theresa too. Was he still with her? She compromised. Washed her face and under her arms, freshened make up, stripped naked then put on just a pair of flannel pants and a tank. When she came out of he was drinking a beer, checking out her music. âSince when did you go all country?â âItâs not all  country. Thereâs some stuff from the old days. Probably some Floyd, something you can get behind.â âWell thereâs definitely something I canâ¦â He looked at her sideways with a grin. âYeah yeah yeahâ She headed to the kitchen. While she opened her beer she heard Madonna come up on the stereo. They sat down on the couch and started to talk. Slowly at first but the discussion heating up. Her job, his job, him going back to school, politics, her going back to school. While she got particularly heated over a point he lay back with his head in her lap to listen. She kept talking, currying his hair with her fingers, enjoying his admiring looks. When she cooled down he reached up to her neck and gentled her to him, close enough to breathe each other. âYou are so  beautiful.â His tongue along her lips, his lips nuzzling her face and neck. She wriggled down to lay on top of him, giving as good as she got.  Like their discussions their kissing got heated, more insistent. His hands rediscovering her breasts, hers reflexively gripping his ass. She kept trying to think that something might be wrong with this but her skin took her attention away and then he flipped her over. He liked to be on top, in control. He didnât mind when she was aggressive but only when he said it was time for it. Suddenly he stopped and just looked at her. Her eyes flew open. He was just an inch from her face looking in her eyes, not quite touching lips. âI came here for a reason.â Pounding heart joined by a lump in her throat. âWhat?â âI want to tell you something.â âWhat?â It was all she had.  âIâm getting married.â There was spit caught in her throat. She couldnât swallow it. She was trapped, suffocating. All her energy in keeping her face neutral. Had to get out, get away from him now! âOw.â He looked hurt. âYouâre squashing me, canât breathe.â Her face was neutral but her hands and feet were scrabbling, shoving him off her so hard that when he lifted his weight she fell onto the floor. And she could see that if she hadnât looked so pathetic he would have laughed. âOw.â âYou OK?â Now the challenge was not to cry. âYou want another beer?â Silence. âSure.â Escape to the kitchen. Her shaking hands trying to open the bottles would give her extra time. But he heard her fumbling and came in. From behind he enclosed her in those strong arms and felt her tremble. âWhy? â she asked. The reasons didnât really matter. Heâd been with Theresa for years. Not as many as with Mags but steadier. Theresa was an architect, made good money. They had college, mutual friends, a dog; theyâd already made a life together. This was the next logical step. Love isnât logical. And she loved him. Had for years on end. He loved her too. It had to be love if she was willing to break all the rules to be with him. âYou OK?â he asked again. âYeah. Well, no, but yeah.â âYou want this beer?â âPlease.â He opened it for her and watched as she took a long pull from the bottle. A part of him wanted her to beg him not to. Give him a reason not to get married, something other than a lack of spark. Who leaves a woman after 10 years because thereâs no spark? An idiot. And thatâs just what his family would say and his friends. So heâd tried to ignore the spark issue. Easy enough for the most part but sparks burn and smolder. Inside him a jolly little blaze was developing from being so near Margaret. She ignited his body but also his mind and his heart and no matter the practical reasons for not marrying her he couldnât forget her or even stay away from her. Where do you put that sort of connection? How do you deal with it? She wandered into the living room, stopped the CD player, turned on the television. He sat next to her. She handed him the remote. âMargaret.â She looked at him. She looked away. An hour later she was asleep, her feet in his lap and he had to go. His cell phone had been off for hours. Theresa would be wondering what happened. He needed to get back to his motel and be ready to leave on time tomorrow. Mags woke up when he slid out from under her feet. Silently she watched him gather his things, put on his shoes. Only when he knelt to kiss her did he realize she was awake. âIâve got to go.â She nodded. âIâll see you soon.â âI meant what I said.â âWhat?â âI know it was ages ago but I meant it. If you marry her I canât see you anymore. I have to draw the line somewhere.â He smiled, started to put on the charm. âBut why there? Itâs just a piece of paper.â âItâs a commitment.â âI was committed to her before. You knewâ¦â Magsâs eyes changed the smallest bit and it said everything. She hadnât really known, not until now. It turned his fingers cold to realize that. Changed the whole meaning of his engagement. But it was too late to stop now.For lack of anything better to do he smoothed the blanket around her and kissed her forehead. He kept hoping some words would come to him but they didnât so he had to just get up and go.

      I have despair.   Sounds like I translated that but I just like the way it sounds. Because I have it. Hold it. It's an undercurrent these days. Politics, personal, friends, world, city.  So I just watched Whalerider.   Small community going to pot and one person makes a difference, bands them together and helps them to improve themselves. Beautifully done, gorgeous young woman, wonderful place, moving story.  But, not meaning to date myself, we are the world now. My boss talks about it, all the politicians do, all the environmentalists. We live it every day. Take your bank card to Europe and pull $100 out of your US checking account in under 3 minutes. Send off a note to your friend in Australia. By e-mail. And have it arrive moments later. Make a phone call. Watch TV.   We are billions of people. And we do have the ability to affect all of those other people. For the most part the only ways I can think of are violent and bad. Weapons, bombs, electing crap officials. With the right weapon one single person can affect the lives of millions of others relatively easily.   But how do we affect each other well? One person can't seem to stop even one of those weapons or change any minds. That's not true. I'm sure that one person can change some minds but not enough to make an appreciable difference. Not enough to change the course that we seem to be on. We still operate under a war time mentality, an imperitive, if you will, because those are the people with power.   The Power of Peace.  Never heard of it?  Me either. Because we haven't located it yet.  I know that I'm not alone in struggling with the question of how I can make enough of a difference to rest my heart. But I am one of those legion. My dream job isn't in politics or activism or even teaching any more; how can I help? I used to think that reaching one person at a time was enough. And, for my art, I guess it is. I'd rather reach more than one at a time but if I get one per performance that seems like enough to me. Enough reason to move forward and try to reach more people next time at least. But what if, in terms of peace and justice and cooperative globalization I reach just one kid - Rosa - or 3 kids - Rosa and Brendan and Kaleigh - is that enough? Because clearly not everyone, and I feel not enough people, are working in that direction. And even the people that are, aren't always reaching even as many people as I am.  I am paralyzed by my lack of confidence that November's election will elect anyone but Bush. I have little money. I can't fund a huge push for voter registration. I don't have an enormous amount of faith in the main opponent to our President. And I rarely, if ever, argue with ANYONE about something I'm not completely sure about. I suppose on that level I could argue that I'm fully certain that Bush should NOT be president. It's such an emotional issue, though, for me and for so many others on both sides. I don't think arguing will help. But perhaps it will.   I want to strip naked and paint myself blue and run screaming through Madison Square Garden during the Republican National Convention. I want to do something that will actually change the minds of more people. Many people. My complete lack of understanding as to why anyone could think that this lying, cheating, violent disaster of a president is our best hope makes it much harder for me to argue against them. It's better to see both sides.  It's a big issue. Every issue is a big issue now. Plastic bags. Fossil fuels. Education. Religion. Too big for one small person to shoulder?

      Sometimes I just don't do things the way other people do. Sometimes there's even a good reason for it.  I'm making these marketing packets for my play which I'm selling to schools ( urlLink www.SusannaShakespeare.com  "A valuable complement to standard English curriculum!"). I think I've done a good job with them and lord knows it took me long enough. That said, I'm now at the point where the tweaking is ended and it's all about printing and collating. Including getting out the big honking can of spray adhesive and trying to spray it only on the back of the cover page and not onto cats or dog or furniture or electronics or too much of me, despite the blowing of millions of fans at high speed in the colossally humid heat of the New York summer.  Last night there was much printing, a lot of printing. So much printing. And then some re-printing to cover for the fact that I failed to notice that one picture had migrated to the page above completely misaligning the rest of the document or that I'd used my costume designer's premarital name or that the cat had jumped onto the computer and added wewererwfrwefsdfiohysifdj to the cover page. I found the last error at exactly the time I was supposed to be in bed so I fixed that and did not do any collating.  "I'll collate before work" said I.  Which is how I found myself at 6:30 this morning standing half naked in my tub madly spraying adhesive on the backs of cover sheets and sticking them to the fronts of folders.  The logic here was that I could scrub the tub later, after work (like after work some time this  fall ) if need be and no extra ill would come of it. So, no drop cloth, no newspaper, no animals walking onto drop cloth and newspaper and becoming stuck and necessitating stoppage of collation for adhesive/fur removal. And the half naked thing was because it's much easier to remove the adhesive from skin than from clothing.  It all makes perfect sense.  Until you take a moment and really  see  yourself and think,  I'm a reasonably intelligent adult female standing half naked and sticky in her bath tub before 7 o clock in the morning...in the name of ART. What is up with that?

       Picture a man, barefoot, shirt unbuttoned, standing in a hallway in front of a door. A woman comes down the stairs with a suitcase and a coat. She reaches for the door and he stills her hand. His fingers unconsciously rub back and forth over the rings on her finger. Not angrily she pulls her hand from his grip and looks him pointedly in the eye. He tries to speak and finds that he canât. She looks away and then looks at him and breathes in as if to speak but decides against it. She lifts her suitcase again, skirts the man and exits the house shutting the door firmly behind her.   I hate flying. Itâs better if I have someone to talk to so usually I travel with someone. But sometimes that just isnât possible. âThose are beautiful.â So I have to go on a recruiting mission. âIâm sorry?â This woman is pretty, not beautiful or drop dead gorgeous but attractive, well put together, even though sheâs not flashy, all monotone clothes and small earrings, short hair. The only thing that stands out about her are her rings. âYour rings, theyâre beautiful.â âThank you.â I probably would have talked to her anyway. I really need to talk to someone. Did I mention that I hate flying? But the rings gave me a good way in. There were maybe 6 or 7 of them winding around the bottom of her left ring finger. All silver, or maybe platinum, what do I know? All plain, rounded except one in the middle that was flat with a deep blue sapphire channel set into it. âAre they all wedding rings?â She looks up. I might snag her. âNo, just one.â Monosyllables, not a good sign. âBut my husband did give them all to me.â Sheâs falling! I need to be creative here, keep working. âAre they all from special occasions then?â She puts a finger in her book to hold her place. âYes, heâs been giving them to me for 8 years now. Says theyâre like rings on a tree so you can tell how old the relationship is.â âThatâs sweet.â âActually itâs kinda sappy. Fortunately heâs cute when heâs sappy.â I run out of steam so we sit in silence looking at the rings on her hand, which lies on her book. She finally flips the book open again to read. Panic! âHow do you tell them apart? Which one for which occasion? Which one he gave you when?â I am not making a good impression. She doesnât look up for a moment. Waits, takes a breath and then moves her bookmark and stuffs the book into the seat pocket. âItâs on the inside. Here.â She starts to tug the rings off 2 and 3 at a time, working them back and forth over the knuckle until she holds them in her right fist then she drops them into my palm. âGo ahead, you have to hold them up to the light.â Each ring has a word engraved on the inside in simple block letters. STRENGTH. PEACE. LIGHT. âWhich one is your wedding ring?â âGuess.â She smiles. Even though I figure itâs gotta be a trick question I pick the one engraved LOVE. âLOVE?â âNo.â âUhâ¦JOY?â âNo.â âTell me?â âPEACE.â âOh. Wow.â She chuckles. âWhere were you married? âOn a beach in California. Right out front of our favorite restaurant.â âYou rented the whole restaurant?â âNo, it was only us and our parents. Weâd been together a long time by that point. A big wedding seemed kind of silly and none of anyoneâs business, really.â   Picture a man and a woman standing on a beach. The setting sun over the water washes them in soft light. She wears a simple, ankle length white dress. He wears a deep blue suit and white shirt, no tie. They are barefoot. She slips a ring from her thumb and slides it onto his finger. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes an identical platinum band. Before he places it on her finger he holds it up for her to read the inscription. She holds his hand in hers to steady it and her eyes tear as she reads the word. After he fits her with the ring their fingers lock together and he pulls her close enough to kiss her forehead and linger there breathing her in.   Werenât your friends mad?â âSome of them but by the time anyone found out weâd been married almost a year so anger was kind of superfluous. My husband started saying, âWhat does it matter to you if we got married? You thought we were going to break up?ââ âSmart.â âHeâs a smart cookie.â âWhatâs LOVE for then?â âI was hit by a car and he gave me that when I got home from the hospital.â âOh my god. Thatâs horrible.â âIt wasnât my best day. The getting hit part. The coming home was pretty good.â âI donât mean to be nosy but how â¦you donât have to answer if you donâtâ¦â âNo, itâs OK. Itâs my little Public Service Announcement. Always bring ID when you leave the house. No matter how short the errand. You never know. I went out to walk the dog. It was summer. I had on a dress, shoes and was carrying keys, plastic bags and a dog leash. That was it. I got hit by a drunk driver, let go of the leash and there I was. We live up in the hills and I walk the dog in some woodsy areas. A jogger found me in a ditch by the side of the road and called 911. They took me to the hospital but no ID so no one knew who I was or how to contact my family.â   Picture a door at the end of a hallway. Stairs to the right lead to the second floor. A living room opens off to the left. Hear shuffling and fumbling before it swings open revealing a woman in a manâs arms about to be carried over the threshold. The door bangs against the wall and swings shut again. Hear laughter. The door swings gently open and the couple steps awkwardly through the door. Now see bandages on the womanâs hands and face, her right wrist is in a cast and she holds a pair of crutches in her hand. He maneuvers her into the living room and onto the couch. While he arranges pillows for her she opens a bag and pulls out a prescription bottle. He takes the bag and moves toward the kitchen but checks himself and returns to perch on the arm of the couch behind her and present her with the velvet box from his pocket. She tilts her head back and winces. He leans down to gently kiss the top of her head and bolts toward the kitchen but she reaches out to grab his hand and pull him back for a proper, long, loving kiss. He runs his hand through her hair, along her cheek and his lip trembles slightly before going to the kitchen. She opens the box and reads the inscription before laying it alongside the other two.   âIâm sorry, I have to ask, was the dog all right?â She laughs. âYes, she was fine, got scared by the noise and ran home. She was sitting on the front step when my husband came home. It took him 3 or 4 hours to figure out where I was. Then he found me in a recovery room all stitched and bandaged and bones set. I think it scared him even more than it scared me and thatâs going some.â âHe gave it to you then?â âNo, after, the day I came home.â âThis is fun!â âGlad youâre enjoying yourself.â What about STRENGTH?â âThat one goes with JOY. There. Theyâre for our daughter. I got JOY when we found out about her and STRENGTH when she was a month old.â   Picture a woman with bags under her eyes, wearing a tank top, sweatpants, hair disheveled. She carries a dirty diaper in one hand. She enters down the stairs and crosses into the kitchen. She re-enters and re-crosses the other way with a full bottle in hand. He meets her halfway, jeans, t-shirt, wild hair, untied shoes and open leather jacket. From behind his back he pulls a small black velvet box. She musters a smile but it doesnât have much behind it. He opens the box and holds it out to her. She extracts the simple platinum band and peers at the inside, when she reads the word her smile deepens. She quickly slips the band on her finger and stands on tiptoe to wrap her arms around him and hold him tightly.   âIs her name Joy?â âOh god, no, I am the sap police. Donât think he didnât think of it.â âHow old is your daughter?â âSheâs 5. Her name is Delia.â âDelia Joy?â âNo. I really put my foot down.â âMust have been hard to stop wearing these when you were pregnant, swelling and everything.â âI didnât take them off then. I wasnât pregnant. Delia is adopted.â   Picture a woman with a phone to her ear. She signs off with distracted thanks and holds the receiver to her chest for a breath, then hangs it up calling, âHoney!â He appears and she looks him in the eye, thrilled. He looks back, questioning. And she nods vigorously, grinning from ear to ear. He picks her up and swings her around while they whoop and laugh and grin. Finally setting her down he pulls open the drawer underneath the phone to pull out the red velvet box. She has a fresh bout of giggles while she opens the box and picks out the platinum band, holding it up to read the word inside which sets her to laughing so happily again that she canât put the ring on. He steps behind her, wrapping his arms around her body, stilling her and taking her hands in his. This way they are able to let the ring slide down against the others on her finger and resume laughing with their lips touching.   âOh, Iâm sorry.â âNothing to be sorry about. I think things worked out just fine. Sheâs a great kid, the light of our lives.â âOh! So LIGHT is about her too?â   Picture a woman in a coffee shop. She is reading a book propped open in front of her meal, fully absorbed. A man enters and slides into the booth next to her. She is startled, looks up. Sheâs surprised and ecstatic, she kisses him passionately. When they break he steals a French fry with one hand while sliding a small velvet box across the table to rest in front of her with the other. Her eyes widen and she questions him with a look. He pushes the box toward her in response. She kisses him again before opening the box to reveal a single, simple, platinum band. She leans in for another series of mumbling thank you kisses while she fumbles the ring out of the box and onto her finger. He pulls away abruptly and takes the ring off her finger, putting it in her palm and admonishing, âRead.â She spins the ring, looking at the outside. âInside.â He explains. She looks again, reads and is kissing him again before he can even see the expression on her face.   âNo, sorry, just an expression I use. LIGHT was the first one. I met my husband in New York but he was living in Los Angeles. On one of his trips to see me he brought that. He probably used the âlight of my lifeâ line too.â âHow did you meet?â âWe ended up at a bar where we each had friends with bands playing. Mine was finishing a set and he asked about them. I piped up from across the table and we started chatting. I e-mailed him about the band and the rest is history.â âYou moved to Los Angeles?â âYeah, thatâs when I got FAITH, so to speak. Apparently I spouted off one too many times about how stupid it is to follow a man across the country. So I was admonished with a permanent reminder to trust him.â   Picture a woman entering with suitcases. A man opens the door for her, helps her in with her luggage. She is uncomfortable in the surroundings. He is showing her around. An empty drawer here, a closet there. He shows her a beautiful bed, big, open, made up but not taut. On the pillow, centered, a small box of deep blue velvet with a white ribbon tied around it in a bow. She smiles, checks with him and he urges her forward. She crawls onto the bed, up from the bottom and sit cross-legged to untie the bow and open the box. A single platinum band sits inside. She smiles and turns to find him kneeling behind her, looking over her shoulder. She grasps his face and kisses him deeply. He tries to press her back to the bed but she fights him with playful shoves working around him to slide the band out of the box and onto her finger with the identical one she wears. Then she locks her wrists behind his head and flops back, bringing him with her, laughing all the way.   Iâm running out of things to ask. And rings. I run through them all. LIGHT, FAITH, LOVE, PEACE, JOY and STRENGTH. Iâm done. Except for the one with the stone. âWhat about this one?â âUh, he said it matched my eyes.â   Picture a man and a woman sitting at a small table in a dimly lit restaurant. One dessert lies between them with a spoon propped on either side of the plate. He hands a velvet box across the table to her. She smiles slightly and lays the box on the table to pull the bow loose. Inside is a flat platinum band with a deep blue sapphire set flush into it. She is surprised. Gingerly she slides it on top of her other rings then looks up at him. He smiles back somewhat uncertainly. She kisses her fingertips and reaches across the dessert to lay them on his lips. He kisses them lightly before they both reach for their spoons and begin eating toward the middle.   âSo itâs a symbol of how your relationship has moved beyond words. Eyes as the windows of the soul and everything?â âYou know, he never said.â âOh.â I have to hand them back. They pour into her open palm and she slowly slides them on her long finger one by one. âAny particular order?â âLots of people ask that. No. Well, some days. Depends how I feel but usually I just try to get them all safely on.â âExcuse me ladies,â the flight attendant breaks in, âcould you please fasten your seatbelts weâre about to taxi for takeoff.â I hate flying.   Picture a man standing alone in an airport terminal. His shirt is untucked, his jacket is open. His jeans and shirt are wrinkled. His hands are stuffed in his pockets. He is waiting. He checks a monitor, he looks around. Then he reaches into the pocket of his jacket and removes a small velvet box. He squeezes it in one hand then the other then replaces it in his pocket before putting his hands back in his pockets and looking toward the gate.

      It is widely rumored that when my cousin, Went, heard that Danny Ainge was traded from the Celtics she threw up.  I'd just like to say that I've kept my food down.  But I am not fucking happy.  Let's see, solid team player? Check. Fabulous shortstop? Check. Middling to excellent batting average? Check. No skeletons in the closet? Check.  Let's trade him.  No, wait, that's no fun. Let's humiliate him then trade him and try to get the fans to think it's a good idea.  I predict that we'll see the Cubs deep in the playoffs this season. They were doing great on their own last year and now they've got an extra piece to the puzzle. More power to them. They've been waiting longer than we have anyway. But I want 5 minutes alone in a room with the punk ass kid running the Red Sox.  The curse is not Babe Ruth's. I think it's some sort of crack they put in the water at Fenway Park. Something that dings off an alarm in the system of any member of the management as soon as a group of players is assembled who might actually be able to play the game and play it well together. "Oh crap! This is as good as I've seen it! What do I do now? Better make some sweeping change." And rather than hiring somebody hot to sing the national anthem or painting a mural of ex-presidents on the Green Monster they decide instead to pick one of their top 5 most valuable players and TRADE HIM.  History. Doomed to repeat it. Babe Ruth. Roger Clemens. Nomar Garciaparra.  I wish Nomar luck. I think he is a wonderful player and a good role model for anyone becoming a high profile sports figure. I hope he's happy wherever he is. I even forgive him for marrying Mia Hamm before he even gave me a chance.  I am not, however, quite ready to forgive the management of the Red Sox.

      She wore her rings like armor. Silver standing up between her knuckles, hardening her. The protection both coating her and lashing out from her. As much as they accentuated the slim gracefulness of her fingers those weren't digits you were allowed to touch. No gentle kisses could be pressed to the barbs that adorned them.  They made making love to her an even more valuable experience. This was not a woman to whom one gained entrance lightly. For him the tension was always palpable before they made love. Would she remove the rings? All of them? Because until the last one rested safely in the toe of her shoe the deal was unsealed.  One day they were the last thing she removed. For months afterwards he masturbated to the memory of her sitting nude and upright on the edge of the bed slowly removing each tiny cylinder.  More off-putting yet no less engrossing was the re-arming of her shields. One ring straightened her spine, another flattened her feet against the floor and those two, in concert, reorganized her face, making it fit again for public consumption.  When asked about her barriers in a coffee shop she simply smiled as though he were a darling but slightly presumptuous child. When asked in bed she turned to face him, folding her naked hands into tiny fists under her chin.  "I need them."  "You don't need them now."  "Now is different." She smiled.  And that made him feel special. So special that he stopped asking and kissed her bare knuckles.

      At the time it seemed like a good idea. Thrilling and daring and, in some frightening way, a step in the right direction.  We waited in line and got the tickets together. Four tickets, two sets of two, each set far from the other.   I ended up going alone. I just couldn't find the right person to take on this kind of adventure. I don't think that there are guidelines written by Miss Manners or Martha Stewart for who to take to a play that your lover and his wife are also attending.  It's embarrassing to think about now. I've been trying to think about it, to write about it, for a couple of months now and the embarrassment is so acute even now, over 5 years later, that I can't  dwell on it for even a full minute.   I remember spending most of the play trying to find them without looking like I was looking. I don't remember when I located them, but I must have, because as everyone filed out of the theatre I maneuvered myself to follow them.   Oddly I don't remember what they looked like or what they were talking about. I just remember me. I was wearing tight fitting brown peg leg pants from the Gap and a brown shirt and ankle boots and was carrying a straw purse that I'd inherited from a dancer friend. I felt tall (as tall as I can be) and long legged and sexy. Well, I felt as though I was projecting that and that's what was important. It was important that when he looked at me he wished he were sitting with me instead of with her. Even if he didn't change seats. That he should feel as dissatisfied in the moment as I.  The whole evening was dissatisfying. I go to theatre and movies and stores and countries by myself all the time. Most of the time. That night was the same. I was alone. I was watching someone who didn't, at least then, and probably not now either, do much of anything all alone. I was just an observer in what is labelled an adult relationship. I didn't learn anything more about him or her or them. I didn't get anything out of it.   I have no idea, really, what I was supposed to get out of it. It was my idea to go to the play, his to do it this way. I'm sure he had a good reason. At least one that seemed good at the time. He always does. I'll be damned if I can remember it though.  All I can remember is walking through the edges of Central Park in a crowd waiting to be noticed.   And I wasn't.

      Most days I get at least one million dollar idea.  If you look at it the right way.  Today's example is Cranberry Toilet paper. Not the color. TP with actual cranberry properties for the urethrally challenged among us chicks.  Have terrible yeast or UTI battles? Here's another weapon in the war. And you don't even have to add anything to your day, it heals while you're doing something you'd do anyway.  Brilliant I tell you. Just need a little venture cap.

      Friend of a friend's going away party. She's moving to Scotland.  Stupid Theatre Friend calls with no warning needing a place to stay, oh yeah and also his TD who I don't know from Adam.  They show up at my house after bedtime.  TD is assmonkey.  Get the call that tells me they're moving her to a nursing home...today. First I heard of it.  Call dad to vent on the first I heard of it. Find out that not only did he know about the move (assumed mom would tell me) he spent last Thursday asking mom for a divorce. (n.b. This is not a big leap as they haven't lived in the same state since I was in Jr. High but the fact that the word divorce has left someone's lips is a monumental change in status quo.)  Spend 45 minutes discussing mother's and father's emotional state. For those reading the fun meter on this one it's at about a .5.  Crying. Lots of crying. I can't stop thinking about her spending her first night in that place all by herself tonight. I just wish someone had told me.

      He rode aimlessly through the streets of the housing development. They all looked the same. He could ride to the next town and it would look the same too. Like God got bored when he got to Michigan and just die cut everything like car parts. It wasnât so much like that up north but down here, below the tri-cities it was all alike. And everyone seemed happy with that. Happy kids playing street hockey, happy dads cutting grass, happy moms unloading cars full of happy groceries and happy dogs seeing everyone at home. As he rounded the corner onto Pine, or maybe it was Spruce? Elm? Better yet, Hemlock. He couldnât tell. But as he came around that corner someone wasnât happy. Two someones in fact. A teenage girl and a young boy of maybe 5 or 6. The shock of this break with the norm slowed him down and he recognized the girl, Annie Jensen. He knew her from church, school. Theyâd grown up together but werenât particularly close. He stood up on the pedals and pressed on for about a block until the street was filled by another street hockey game and the handlebars just turned all the way around. On this pass he got close enough to hear what she was saying. Only snippets of it, above the kidâs rhythmic wailing. ââ¦you OK?â¦I knowâ¦hurtsâ¦no bloodâ¦â At the edge of the perfectly manicured lawn he unceremoniously dumped his bike and strolled up the grass beside the walkway. âHey.â Annieâs head snapped up and her look was purely suspicious until she recognized him, then she softened up all the way to noncommittal, âHey.â âWhat happened?â he asked. âFace plant off the slide.â She bobbed her head in the direction of a jungle gym in the side yard. âOw. He OK?â âI think so but he wonât stop crying. Itâs been like 10 minutes.â He knelt down and reached out for the boyâs curly hair. âYouâre OK. Let me see what happened.â The boy turned the full force of his sobbing directly into Robâs face. Rob blinked and that was it. Caught the boyâs face in his hands and gently touched every part of it, then moved on to the arms, legs, the ribs and the wailing went on uninterrupted, clearly not from physical pain, âWell, Iâve got bad news for you.â Annie blanched. âYouâre gonna live. Except maybe for these ribs here. They might have a terrible problem.â Both Annie and the boy looked worried. All sound had stopped. âI think they might be ticklish.â And Rob proceeded to tickle the boyâs ribs, belly, chin and armpits. It took a few seconds but he got the laughs he was looking for. They built until the boy squealed and ran onto the lawn. Looking back over his shoulder he yelled, âChase me!â With a brief glance at Annie, Rob obliged. They ran all over the lawn under and around the jungle gym until Rob caught his foot on the edge of the damned slide and fell, crashing from his 6â4â to the grass with a thud. Before he could even roll over the boy had jumped on him and was yanking his shoulders yelling, âGet up! Get up!â Annie rescued him by picking the kid up, âJoshua, give Rob a break, OK? He needs a moment. Why donât you swing.â When Joshua had been dispatched she leaned down to where Rob was continuing to enjoy the feeling of cool grass on his cheek. âYou OK?â âIâm fine. It feels pretty good down here, you should try it.â She went so far as to sit down cross-legged near his head so she could watch Joshua. He had belly flopped onto the swing set and was twisting round and round getting ready to lift his legs and enjoy the unwinding. âHeâs going to throw up.â She observed. Rob heaved himself over onto his back and tilted his head to look. âYou think?â âChoked on a cheerio and face plant off the slide and Iâve only been here half an hour, puking has to be in my future.â âHmmm. Maybe.â âSo, what are you doing here?â "Just riding around. You baby-sit here often?â âToo often.â Joshuaâs swing had come to rest. He got off and was wobbling around on the grass looking very much like he might vomit. âThe parents are friends of my parents from church.â Joshua finally stumbled and fell, giggling in the grass. âHeâs cute.â âI guess.â âI canât wait to be a dad. Slide with my kids, teach âem how to ride a bike, read stories.â âYeah right.â âWhat?â âWhat 15 âyear-old guy wants to be a dad?â He looked her straight in the eye for a moment. She thought he might be trying to figure out whether or not she was kidding. Then he said, âNo.â She broke from his gaze when Joshua came flying by and belly flopped across Robâs chest. âIâm hungry.â âMac and Cheese with hot dogs?â Annie offered. âYay!â Annie pushed herself to standing and headed to the house. When they stepped onto the patio she checked over her shoulder and instead came face to his feet. Rob was carrying Joshua over his shoulder. She looked around, confused, at the lawn, Robâs bike, the neighborâs houses and finally sighed a bit and pushed open the door, standing back to let the boys in. She pointed as they walked, âFamily room, TV, his room is up there, bathroom and game room downstairs. Itâll take me maybe 20 minutes to make dinner. About 20 minutes later she walked into the family room and had opened her mouth to tell them dinner was ready when she got interested in what they were doing. They were lying on the floor staring at the Chutes and Ladders board. The pieces had been swept to the side on the floor and they had covered the board with paper. Rob had a pen and was writing and talking, âThis one means hello and you say it _____â â_____â Joshua tried. âPretty good. Here, Iâll make you a big one.â As he picked up the pen again he noticed Annie lurking. âItâs Japanese. I took those summer classes.â âCool. Umm, dinnerâs ready.â âThanks.â The boys popped up and followed her to the kitchen. Rob rescued nearly spilled milk, he picked out cool pajamas and he read stories in different funny voices. He also negotiated a night-light instead of an open door and only one glass of water. It was possibly Annieâs most successful Joshua-sitting experience since heâd learned to walk and talk. She thought that she should be taking notes. She also thought that when the small audience was asleep he would probably leave. Annie knew Rob, she would even call him a friend but not a close friend. Theyâd never been to each otherâs houses or gone out for ice cream. They had some friends in common though, sometimes ate at the same lunch table and had hung out a couple of times at church functions.  She wasnât surprised that heâd stopped to give her a hand when he saw her struggling. She was surprised that heâd stayed. After heâd delivered Joshuaâs water he sat back down at the kitchen counter to finish the milk from dinner while Annie loaded the dishwasher. âWhy did you decide to teach him Japanese?â she asked. âHe asked.â âOut of the blue he asked, âDo you speak Japanese?ââ âNo, I was speaking Japanese to make him laugh and he asked what it was.â âWhy Japanese?â âIt seems like the farthest place from here you could ever go and they offered it at the University summer school thing so I decided to check it out.â âIsnât it really hard? I mean, at least with French or Spanish you get to use the same old alphabet.â âYeah, I guess. Theyâre pictures, though, and theyâre kind of fun to draw. I picked it up pretty quick.â He drained the glass and stood up to put it in the dishwasher before she closed the door and started it. âWhere are the parents?â âDetroit at a concert or something. Theyâll be back around midnight.â It was 7:30. âDo you want some company?â âYeah, sure. I mean youâll have to go way before they get back and everything but sure we could uh, play a game or watch some TV. Do you want to bring your bike up to the patio? You know for safetyâs sake.â OK, so apparently she was nervous. âLetâs see,â he said coolly, âSure, of course. No thanks, I just got my ass whupped in Chutes and Ladders. Whatâs on? And sure, Iâll go do that now.â âIâllâ¦I guess Iâll go turn on the TV. Family room, you know?â âBe right back.â âOK.â With 6 premium channels plus all the regular cable youâd think itâd be easier to find something good on TV. She settled on Win Ben Steinâs Money then curled her feet up under her on the couch. Rob came back and sat on the other end of the couch. While he quietly answered the questions on the show he took his sneakers off and bent his long legs to put his feet on the sofa between them. Over time teenagers are like magnets, theyâll come together. First it was just feet, then, when Annie shifted uncomfortably he invited her to turn and sit in the circle of his arms and legs. By now they were watching The Breakfast Club, something theyâd seen a million times so neither of them was concentrating on it. Rob laced the fingers of one hand through hers and used the other to stroke patterns on her forearm. When the subtle whiff of her shampoo became too much for him he nestled his chin on her shoulder and that nestling led inevitably to kissing the curve of her neck. Up to then Annie was too nervous to do much but accept his attention but when he started kissing her, her hand flew up almost involuntarily to the back of his head to hold him there, keep him from stopping. His hair had been shaved earlier that month for a swim meet and by now it was fuzzy, like a teddy bear. It felt delicious under her palm. Turning to kiss for real was only a little awkward. Eventually his hands slid under her shirt and she let him touch her breasts. She kept herself mostly to his arms and back, though. At some point after they had rolled onto the floor she heard a zipper. Trying to be cool she pulled back slightly, âRob?â He pulled back and looked at her. The same look heâd had earlier. âThey might come homeâ¦I just donâtâ¦â âItâs OK.â He rolled onto his back and pulled her close with one arm. âItâs still early.â âYeah, but Joshuaâ¦â ââ¦knows weâll come if he calls.â They were silent for a long time. Annie couldnât look at him. Rob started to stroke the fingers of her hand resting on his chest. He took his time so that she wouldnât stop him, gently sliding her hand down over his stomach, letting her rest and wait. When the side of her hand brushed the tip of his cock she flinched. She hadnât meant to. It wasnât as though she didnât know where they were going with this whole hand thing. Now she was embarrassed. Bold and ridiculous honesty were her normal fall back positions so she went with them, âUmâ¦I donât know if Iâ¦ want toâ¦â he waited for her to go on, âto well, touch it.â âYou donât know if you do?â he teased. She didnât like being teased. âNo, I mean I donât want to touch it.â Not unkindly he asked, âHave you ever touched one?â âNo.â âThen how do you know?â he was almost teasing again. Annie got the giggles, âI donât know I just donât thinkâ¦â âHe wonât bite.â âWell, I didnât think that.â âHere,â Rob linked his fingers with hers and brought her hand down until they were both holding his cock. He led her to stroke it and when sheâd gotten the hang of it he slid his hand away and leaned up to kiss her again. So they went on like this for a bit. She didnât know what else to do so she just kept doing what heâd shown her and that made her wonder if she should be doing anything else and that meant her mind was about as far from enjoyment as she could be and that meant that fears of being caught and rumors spreading around church got the better of her. But he hadnât stopped before. The panic started to rise in her, she was forming arguments in her mind and then suddenly she slipped sideways and their teeth clanged together so hard that tears came to Annieâs eyes. âOw!â âYeah. You OK?â âI guess.â She took her hand off his penis, âOw.â He was doing that intense staring thing again. Annie drew breath, âWe need to stop this and you need to go. Iâve got to put away the dishes and this stuff in here before they get home.â He stared a minute longer, assessing perhaps, âOK.â Then he lay on his back on the floor and let out a breath. Annie lay back next to him and they just stared at the ceiling breathing, not touching for a minute or two. Eventually he zipped himself up and they sat up together. Annie passed him his shoes and walked him to the door when he was ready. Before he opened the screen door he turned and kissed her gently on the forehead, just at the hairline. As he mounted his bike on the walkway she mustered up, âThanks.â He turned his head and smiled then rode away.

      I knew this would happen. But I did it anyway.  I took Friday and today off work because if I didn't take some time away someone was going to get hurt. Because, in case you haven't noticed, I hate my job. (Apologies to anyone from work who is reading this. Although no one who disagrees with me about the hating thing could ever find this because they don't know me AT ALL so they could hardly even search this.)  The problem comes with the going back tomorrow. It is so much harder to go back after 4 blissful days off than after a regular 2 day weekend where the ire keeps me asleep for half of it.   It's always this way and I know this but there was nothing else to be done for it.   I wish I could make this funny but I just can't find anything funny of it on this the night before.   Sigh.   A guy walks into a bar with a poodle under his arm and a 6 foot salami under the other....  Anyone know the end to that joke?

      I, like so many people, have been watching a lot of Olympic coverage. I'm trying to watch out of the norm stuff. Well, my norm at least. Which teaches me a lot and leaves me a lot to wonder about.  How could I possibly think, "He might be washed up." about a swimmer who is 21 years of age?  How does a badminton shuttle get going that fast if it's got the little wings to slow it down?  Doesn't that hurt?  But the most niggling questions of these Olympic games thus far comes from women's beach volleyball. These are some lovely women, and damn good at what they do. (Please note that I have nothing but respect for all these athletes and I am not against scantily clad athletes of any stripe.)  That being said, though, these women are serious high level athletes at the top of their game and they are wearing outfits that cover less of their bodies than my underwear does.  Some might remind me that there's more body for my underwear to cover but that's still not what I'm getting at.  There's diving. Into sand. And these ladies are wearing teeny tiny bikini briefs. Any 3 year old who has tripped in the shallow surf can tell you how long it takes to work the last grain of sand out of your intimate hills and valleys. So, wouldn't you be better off with a little coverage? Don't you want to make the trek that much longer before that Norwegian or Greek sand (depending which side of the blue line you land on) hits home? Apparently not.  And then, there's the one picture I cannot get out of my mind.  Being a hard hitting, aggressive sport, teammates tend to slap each other in encouragement. Around the sand entry areas. The ones that are barely covered. You know, the ass.  And all I can think is that sooner or later, on international television, purely by accident,  someone's going to get a handful of sandy coochie.

      Perhaps I'm hopelessly uncool. Perhaps hostess gifts are completely passe (I have no idea how to put an accent on that e). Or perhaps my weekend has been over run by rude people. What do you think?  Let's say that you're staying with a friend in another state. Other members of your traveling party are staying in other locations. These other members might need to get in touch with you but you have become separated from your cell phone. Do you a. Give out your friend's home/cell number without telling her? b. Ask if it would be all right to give out her information as it would be a great help on your trip?  You are one of the other members of the traveling party and you need to get in touch with the cell phone deprived member. When you call the number do you say a. Is Jorge around? in your sullen pseudo Euro trash voice. b. Hi, this is Magdalena I'm sorry to bother you but I'm trying to track Jorge down and I was wondering if you could help me? in your "for company" voice.  You are another member of the traveling party and are staying with the friend. You need to borrow a computer and internet access in order to do some vital work for the project necessitating the trip. Which question do you ask? a. "So, uh, internet access?" b. "I need to do some vital work on the project, would it be all right if I borrowed your computer?"  You have a huge and exciting project happening in another state. You have friends in that state. You are bringing a huge bunch of friends from your state and they all need inexpensive or preferably free places to stay. Do you a. Call a friend from the car on your way to their state and tell them that all the good places in the center of town fell through, you're going to need a place to stay the next night can you crash at her place? b. Call all your friends in their state who are excited about your project and offer them a free ticket to your project and/or undying gratitude and/or thanks in the program in exchange for invading their home for a couple of weeks for this very important event.  You have managed to secure a place, pretty near the exact spot in town you wanted to stay. The hostess has roommates and is working 6 jobs in order to keep this lovely dwelling in its prime location. Do you a. Arrange to get keys or to arrive at her home before she goes to sleep? b. Arrive late at night waking up one or both of the apartment's inhabitants not once but two nights in a row?
