      I ran across this article this morning.This really is sotrue. Unless the pain of losing a loved one hits you directly, you never fully understand the cost. I can imagine the pain because I lost my sonwhen he was only 12-years old. It wasn't for the same reason, but the pain remains. It haunts you every day and your life changes forever. Lets always rememberthose who have truly sacrificed, be compassionateand thank God for his amazing grace, and for the hopethe gift ofeverlasting life brings.    urlLink http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20040728085309990015_mpc=news%2e10%2e9

      Maybe I think too much...I thought this was an interesting article, especially now.Withre-election time upon us again I have noticedwe can become very edgy with one sentence or just hearing a name.We can think we like someone until this subject comes up.We hear an opinionthat is not ours and WHAM! We are immediately trying to think of a way to getREVENGE!They are such an idiot!And so on... Well,I toofound myself getting caught up in this and didn't like it. Ihave never liked confrontation and try to avoid it at all costs. That isn't always the right thing to do (I know) but it's who I am. I also don't think we should be teaching our children to disrespect others just because they may have a different view.We are all humanso getting angry is normal, but let's try todo one thing for each other asAmericans. Stop...Think...Realizewe all have the right to our own opinion. This world would be pretty boring if weall thoughtthe same.Then speak your view with respect for the other person. You will be given respect if you show respect in most cases. Otherwise,you really come across as a total hot-headed jerk, rather than making what may be a good point ofview to share. Now, let's see if I can take my own advise.    urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/health/psychology/27reve.html?ex=1091678400en=00dce92668
