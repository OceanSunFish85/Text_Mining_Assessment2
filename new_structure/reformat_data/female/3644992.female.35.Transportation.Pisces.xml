       I heard  urlLink    this story     on NPR last week. I think a puppy channel is a great idea, although I don't even have to turn on the TV to get laughable dog antics in my house. I think it would kind of be like the weather channel, though. I turn on the weather channel, not so much for weather info, but I find it eerily soothing. This guy's idea was to have a channel that would make people happy. Puppies, he found, make people happy.

      Why'd ya have to go and make things so complicated? ...Gettin' me frustrated!  Life's like this! I suppose boys have the same effect on her that computers have on me.  Web pages and Blogs will be the bane of my existence, so why do I keep coming back for more?
