       I've said it before, I'll say it again. EVERY TIME I try to start back to college something happens to stop me. Between my financial aid taking forever and having so much to do for that, trying to study up before taking the math placement test and now it's time to register and my financial stuff isn't all in order yet, I am screwed. The class times I NEED are filling up fast and will be full by the time I get this done by late registration. On top of that, daycare for Evan called; she's lost her helper and doesn't have room for him anymore. Oh well. Such is my life. I can always get things worked out and start next semester; I'm really in no rush. So I am looking forward to being with Evan at home and who knows, I may just stick at home with him until time for him to start school or pre-k at least. I did it with Tyler, I'd sort of like to do it for him, too. We're potty training right now and I'd like to be the one to work w/ him on that at home if possible! I just have to pray and believe that God is in control of my life and the way things happen is what's best for me and for my family. So I have peace with that and am not stressin' out. Lee is finishing his degree online this semester though! I am thrilled about that! Things could be worse, everyone's healthy and happy, I'm not complaining. Well, not too much anyway.

       Yes it's true. I miss Qatar so badly! I love my home, love America, love Alabama, love being close to where I grew up and went to school and family and friends and all that jazz. I think you just have to have lived overseas or been somewhere for an extended amount of time to a place that is new and amazing every single day, full of culture and people, food, drink, shops, sights, sounds and smells, all those things mingle together to make each day and night something to feel on fire about; very hard to explain! I want so badly to finish my degree first though. I'd love to take my education and training and possibly work there some day. I mentioned this longing to return to DH and he said he "feels the pull" too. I know what a great American school the kids would go to and the amazing opportunities the kids there have to do really cool things; field trips to Switzerland? Sure, I'll chaperone! I loved the things Tyler was exposed to and I've always wanted to take Evan back some day to see where he was born. I realize a lot of people reading this will think I'm crazy, just as they did the first time I went and they told me outright I was crazy, LOL, but I think this post should be proof that we did enjoy it there and would love another go round. I'm so torn. My heart aches. I want us to go back and keep our home and things here and come home for the entire summer (like most expats in Qatar do) so we'd sort of be here and there throughout the year. Life is so simple and laid back; we had never been happier. What tears me though is my family. I love my family and missed them a lot but I was so happy at the same time! They'd hate to see us go again. They're so happy we're back in the States again. But I want to leave again. *sob sob* We're in no big hurry though. We just miss the life we had there. It's much the same but much different in good ways. So hard to explain. We'll see.

      I'm sitting here watching "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?" and thinking to myself, "How stupid.  What a joke.  I would never lower myself to something like this."  But the longer I watch it, DH by my side, I begin getting sucked in and judging who I think is best suited for this man.  LOL  I am a sucker for this crap!!!  I signed up for orientation for July 26 at 5pm.  I'm seeing if my mom can sit w/ the boys so DH can go with me.  We've got so much to go over and make sure we've gotten our ducks in a row I want to make sure we're on the same page with my schedule and finances, blah blah blah!!!!!  I'm getting anxious.  Nervous.  Scared!  I'm not 18 and even when I was, I made it through college orientation just fine by myself.  But now I'm 26 and hoping I won't be thrown back in with a bunch of stinkin' teenagers.  LOL    I always play on this blog at night.  I have to go now and see who's next to get eliminated (read: humiliated on national television)!

      I've felt like crap all week and then today I had to drive 2+ hours one way to pick up my eldest son because he was homesick at his grandmother's (who lives near the beach, I'd never come home!) and of course I put my headache aside and loaded up the toddler and we took off after big brother.  I felt so sorry for the little guy though, he wanted to stay and have fun, he really was having a great time, but he got on the phone with me last night and just bawled, "I WANNA COME HOOOOOOOME!"  So, we arranged it. LOL  I guess he had all his 6 year old self could take of being away from home.  I totally understand and remember what that was like myself!  So yeah, I have this sinus thing, ENT told me months ago to have surgery and have it all cleared out and correct my deviated septum.  I started feeling better and said, "Nah.  Don't think so."  Did I do the right thing?  I have a lot of sinus infections and my head and face and even teeth hurt.  I'm starting to rethink this surgery thing.  I had to have a shot in my butt afterall.  :-s  Welp, my husband just turned the lights off on me in here in the living room so I guess it's time to call it a night.

      Well, let's try out this blog thing.  Everyone else is doing it so why can't I?  I think I'll probably be posting most of my experiences with school in this blog along with some other craziness I'm sure but this will be my outlet and possibly a form of therapy!    In another month I will be starting back to college.  I know everyone thinks I'm nuts having done court reporting school for almost a year but I just did not love that, and nursing school is something I wanted to start way back after Tyler was born but the timing has always been bad.  When I came back from the Middle East I wanted to start the pre-reqs for nursing school but since DH was still over there, I couldn't see that schedule working w/ two kids all alone.  But now things have changed, I have a support system and I want to give it a go.  The thing that stinks is in order to start the nursing program at the location I want to do it at (closest to home) I'd have to wait and apply for spring '06, so that means this fall and all of next year I'll be doing pre-reqs and getting all those done as well as my electives so in a way I guess that's good because I won't have to bust tail and can still be home most of the time with Evan before he starts to Kindergarten.  Hopefully I'll be able to work my schedules to coincide with the boys' schedules and be home with them as much as possible.  But I am so looking forward to school!  I'm bummed I have to wait so long to apply for the nursing program though but I guess it's for the best this way right now.  Anyhoo, guess that's enough for my first post!  I'll add more as life goes on!  ;-)
