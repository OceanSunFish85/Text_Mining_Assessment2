       urlLink     Yesterday I took my younger sister Natalie to Canada's Wonderland. I had not been in probably 5 years and she hadn't been in a few years either so we were both really excited. The day got off to a rough start when I was on the 400 highway and noticed the low gas light on. With some trouble and a lot of anxiety, we managed to find a gas station in some townI've never heard of. There wasn't another cut off for quite some time, so if I hadn't noticed the light when I did we could have been stranded on the highway. ANyway, we filled up the van with gas and carried on to Wonderland. We got there just after opening and were on our first ride by 10:30ish. THe line-ups were pretty short 15-20 minutes max. In one case we were able to walk right onto the ride. We did 5 rollercoasters in our first 2 1/2 hours there. It's funny how when you're a kid the rides seem so scary - but as you grow older the thrill of them kind of is gone. They're still lots of fun though - just not terrifying. After five roller coasters I was feeling a bit queazy ( I guess motion sickness comes with gettingolder too)and wanted a break from the coasters for a few minutes so we were going to go on the go-carts. Just a few minutes before our turn to go, it started to rain ... and rain ... and rain... They closed the go-cart ride because of the "dangerous road conditions." We thought we'd wait out the rain. So we waited ... and waited ... and waited, all the while getting more and more wet. We waited under the awning of a game, then we dashed through the rain and stood behind the door of a store, then we went in the store and looked around for quite awhile - and decided to split a huge funnel cake for lunch. Then we waited in line for an indoor ride (a haunted mansion thing) - thinking that since it was inside it would be running. We were waiting for several minutes before we realized the line wasn't moving because that ride too had been shut down. We decided to wait out the rain anyway. We were probably waiting in that line for close to an hour. Unfortunately it just kept raining harder and harder and there was no sign of any of the rides re-opening in the near future. We were wet, cold and miserable. It was thundering and lightning and it was becoming clear that the day was shot. It started raining at 1:05 and when it was still raining after 3:00 with the sky still looking dark and the storm intensifying we decided to leave. There was so much rain on the grounds in some spots that it wasn't draining right so I had water literally up to between my ankles and knees (and honestly I'm not exagerating). We left very disapointed. We hadn't even got to try the newer coasters -all the ones we did first were the classics that we've been on lots before. I feltreally bad for Natalie because when I picked her up in the morning she was bouncing all over the place with excitement. (I felt bad for myself too).   Anyway, after wonderland we decided to go shopping in K-W - figured we might as well do something fun since our day was ruined. Natty bought a cute tank top and a belt (which kind of madeup for the failed trip)and I bought some hangers. Natty had wanted to get fries with gravy at Wonderland so we had fries with gravy for supper at the food court in the mall. Then we surprised my sister and brother-in-law in Elmira and visited them for awhile before heading home.   I guess the worst part of the day was that Wonderland does not give refunds (even though they shut down the rides) - so we paid for a full day but got only 2 1/2 hours. Unfortunately I probably won't get back this season but for Natty's sake I really hope she's able to go again and finish off what we started yesterday.

       urlLink     urlLink      Well, I return to the blogging world with some good news this Thursday evening.  As some of you know, I had an interview today for two full-time, permanent French teaching positions, one in Dundalk and the other in Maxwell. I did not feel that the interview went as well as I would have hoped.  I guess I was somewhat out of practice and I thought I was jumping all over the place with some of my answers.  The panel of interviewers included two principals (Jan Powell and Oscar Burnside) and a Vice Principal (Carole Burgess). The interview lasted aproximately 25 minutes.  About an hour ago I received an important phone call.  Mr Burnside called, saying "... how would you like to join us at Osprey (in Maxwell) ..." Obviously I accepted the position.  I'm officially an "internal" member of the Bluewater District School Board now.  All I can say is "Praise God!"

      As most of you know I'm working at Talisman this summer.  I work in the Golf Clubhouse reserving tee-off times, giving people their "Green Fees" and selling merchandise basically.  Seems easy enough.  I had two days of "training" and then last night I was on my own.  I was responsible for closing down the store at the end of the night - with no help.  What a disaster!  There are a gazilion responsibilities at the end of the day (and I'd only watched someone close once) so I really had no idea what I was doing.  I couldn't get my cash to  balance and had no idea how to fix the problem (supossedly the bookeeper doesn't like it when we don't find and solve the problem ourselves). I finally just handed in the huge mistake with a note saying that I was "new." I have a ring of keys with a ton of diff. keys on them and couldn't find the right one to lock the door so I had to call a porter to come help me lock up.  I should have ended my shift at 8:00pm, instead I was there until 9:50.  Not fun. I was hoping for a stress-free job this summer. A break from teaching  ... something I could go in and work for 8 hours then forget about when I got home.  After my training days I thought that might happen.  Definitely won't be if I'm closing everynight though(and it looks like I will be).    I guess I should be thankful that God provided me with a job this summer and stop complaining.  I'll try ... but I still don't think I'll ever like closing up ... too many responsibilities and too little training.

       urlLink    Creation Calls urlLink     After reading various other people's blogs and really enjoying the discussions and issues raised on them, I decided to start one myself. I know the title is kind of cheezy - I have Dave to thank for that - but it does suit me somewhat though because I do love gardening!  There's something about being outside and working in the yard that draws me closer to God.  As a kid I couldn't figure out how people could be excited about nature.  I found it boring and I guess I took it for granted. Now that I'm a bit older I appreciate it more.  I really don't understand how someone could believe that the earth was a result of evolution.  Just being outside and looking at the perfection of how nature works and the flawless design is proof of God's creation.
