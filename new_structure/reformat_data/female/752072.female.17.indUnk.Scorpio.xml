      I really enjoyed talking on Flo's blog and now that she's back i don't want to intrude so i guess i could start writing on here. We'll see how it goes it guess. I don't know if i will be able to keep up and maintain my own site. I did a good job with Flo's though, updating regularly. I know it gets boring when people don't update.  Not too much going on right now i don't have anything profound to say, hmmm... Oooh! I know... my golfing wisdom:  Bad shots happen but stupid mistakes are unacceptable.   Yes, words to live by. =P  I'll post again soon... I need to come up with a good name and description, something personal but not too complicated. Let me know if you have any ideas! TTYL

      Somewhere Over the Rainbow  Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby. Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.  One day I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly, Birds fly over the rainbow, Why, oh why can't I?  Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly, Birds fly over the rainbow, Why then, oh why can't I?

      Good song... =)  Lifehouse Hanging By A Moment  Desperate for changing  Starving for truth  I'm closer to where I started  Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you  Letting go of all I've held onto  I'm standing here until you make me move  I'm hanging by a moment here with you   Forgetting all I'm lacking  Completely incomplete  I'll take your invitation  You take all of me now...   I'm falling even more in love with you  Letting go of all I've held onto  I'm standing here until you make me move  I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know  I'm running and not quite sure where to go  And I don't know what I'm diving into  Just hanging by a moment here with you   There's nothing else to lose  There's nothing else to find  There's nothing in the world  That can change my mind  There is nothing else  There is nothing else  There is nothing else   Desperate for changing  Starving for truth  I'm closer to where I started  Chasing after you....   I'm falling even more in love with you  Letting go of all I've held onto  I'm standing here until you make me move  I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know  I'm running and not quite sure where to go  And I don't know what I'm diving into  Just hanging by a moment here with you   Just hanging by a moment (here with you)  Hanging by a moment (here with you)  Hanging by a moment here with you

      Serenity Prayer: "God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And theWisdom to know the difference."  I love this prayer. I think it is very true, it puts all our worries into simple terms. All we need to learn to do is accept the things we cannot change andchange the things we can but the key is to have the wisdom to know the difference!

       Well, let me start from the beginning... I was baptised and raised Catholic, I didn't really have a choice in the matter. So now I'm almost 18 and I wonder, what does it mean to be Catholic? I have lots of questions. First, i'll tell you a little about myself just to cleara few things up becauseI know people tend tohave stereotypes in their mind when someone says "Oh, I'm Catholic." First of all I'm a democrat (okay, so I'm not 18, so it's not offical yet butit will be when I sign up to vote this coming fall) and so are both my parents. I am liberal when it comes to social issues, I support homosexual marriage, I'm pro choice, against the death penalty and against the war in Iraq. As far as fiscal issues go, I don't encourage military spending andI don't think we should have gone into Iraq in the first place but I do believe it is our job to clean up and do our best to help now that we are there. I do believe that wealthier people should pay more taxes, not less. I wouldn't encourage large amounts of spending to increase the deficit. I believe that money should be spent to benefit everyone, especially those in need (people who live in poverty, without health care, without money to buy food, to improve their quality of life)not to wealthyspecial interest groups just looking to benefit themselves. As far as foriegn affairs go, I think it's important to make alliances with other countries and work together to make decisions that benefit everyone instead of trying to be a hero and do everything ourselves. This isn't a game, it shouldn't be about winning or losing or power or money. We are all human beings, we are all equal. Perhaps that sounds silly or idealistic but if more people were more accomidating of others instead of just lookingto benefitthemselves this world would be a better place. I believe in preserving and protecting the environment andI am against nuclear weapons. I thinkthey only leads to troubleand power struggles between greedy countries. Perhaps that is not the detailed and organizeddescription that you would have wanted about my political belifs. AlthoughI understand the importants of politics and keeping up with currentevents and news to create my own opinions, I must say that I have always had a hard time doing so. I am not an expert on U.S. history, I do not read the business section, I can not tell you the order of our past presidents, or the names of ourCA senators, I do not like economics or enjoy the stock market but I do have opinions and I do care about people and how we treat each other and our planet. I am not yet 18 and I know I have a lot to learn. I look forward to gaining knowledge and responsibility and I will accept the challenge and do what I can to make this world a better place.  Okay, so back to religion...I don't look down upon people who are not Catholic. I would never try to coerce someone into converting. I don't believe that people who arn't Christians willburn in hell.I respect other people's belifs even if I don't agree with them. I did not enjoy going to church when I was little, in fact I did just about everything I could to avoid it. I distinctly remember having conversations with a friend about how much we didn't like going to church because it was boring. Even now, I don't go to church every Sunday although I do enjoy going. There is always a good message behind each mass, talking about life and improving one's self. The priest doesn'ttry to present himselfto beany different than the rest of us.He treatsusas equals. None of us are perfect, but we come together to learn in a search for inner peace, satisfaction and happiness to share with everyone in our lives. We sing, we pray and we thank the Lord for all that we have been given. I am not familar with all of the stories in the Bible. I do not recite verses on a daily basis. I cannot tell you all the names of the diciples nor can I recite all ten commandments word for word. Does that mean I have failed? Does that mean I'm not Catholic? Some would probably say so but I believe that religion is not about whether you meet all the requirements or how much you pray each day, or what you know. I believe religion is a very personal matter, it's about what works for you. It is all about searching within yourself and learning to be a better person. Learning tobe grateful for what you have and give back to those who helped you and those who need help. It gives me hope, it gives me faith in a greater good in this crazy world. Church is not about being exclusive or elite, it's about people coming together to grow in love. Love for each other and love for God. It's about believing in a greater good and working together to make a difference. To help others, to help yourself. That is my opinion. Take it for what you will, perhaps you feel differently. I don't mean to say that being Catholic and going to church is the only way to achieve these goals, by no means is that true. There are many organizations and groups you can join, there are many other ways to go about doing the same thing. This is just one path, one that I happen to follow. I just wanted to get all that out there to clear things up for myself and so you know a little bit more about me and what my views are. Well, I think that's about it for now. Let me know what you think. Take care!

      I'm not sure whenI wrote this, I thinkit was about two weeks ago. Anyway,I just thoughtI would share it (if anyone reads this thing...Please comment!)instead of letting it rot in Word... these are just sayings that I like and thoughtsI came up with about myself. (hence the title)   -When I commit to something I always do my best  -I am a perfectionist, but I am not perfect  -Although I aim to please, it does not mean my good wishes are false  -On the contrary, I am very honest  -Although I am shy, that doesn't mean I don't want to be asked questions  -Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I don't have anything to say  -I may be innocent but that doesn't mean I'm ignorant  -Although I want to please, it doesn't mean I will give in  -I will stick up for what I believe in  -I may be soft, but I am not easy  -Just because I chose to be kind and give of myselfto many people does not mean my offerings should be valued any less  -I may voluntarily sacrifice myself for others but that does not mean I don't feel pain  -Ask, and you shall receive  -Just because I don't know what to say doesn't mean I don't understand  -I get anxious when I am alone but that does not mean I always want company  -I care what other people think, but that does not mean I am not myself  -I give because it makes me happy, because I want to help, becauseI care andbecause I think it's the right thing to do but that doesn't mean Idon't wantsomething in return  - I don't give to recieve but that doesn't mean you should take my actions for granted  - I do not need your approval or appreciation to make mygiving worthwhile, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when I'm ignored (whenmy actions arn't apprecitated or reciprocated)  -Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I don't have feelings  -Just because I'm shy doesn't mean I can't be passionate  -Just because I serve others, doesn't mean I am weak  -I am stronger than I look  -Somebody has to take the fall, it mind as well be me  -Helping others is a proud and noble job  -Just because I say I'm okay doesn't mean I am  -I will tell you if it's important  -I avoid conflict but that doesn't mean I'm scared  -I don't like arguments but silence is worse  -Just because I forgive, doesn't mean I forget  -I believe these three words (or concepts) are at the root of who I am and are very much involved in why I do (and say) what I do:  -Perfectionism (need to succeed and do my best, always)  -Generosity (need to help people and give back to those who have helped me)  -Self-consciousness (need to be accepted, wanted and loved)

       Have you ever wanted to love someone so much that it hurts? I have. You know, I've spent a lot of time lately thinking about what I want to do with my life, whatI want to accomplish and what I want to be remembered as. And ya know what? Above all, what I want for myself is to find a husband, a man to love, who truely loves me back. That's always been my dream, it's whatI long for, whatI really truely deeply wantin my heart,for me. I do a lot for other people,I am always ready tolisten, tohelp, tomake achange for the better in any wayI can. I get so muchsatisfaction out of helping others and making a difference. It feels so good tobring a smile to someone's face. Even just little things likesmiling,giving a compliment, saying 'thank you'or holding open a door make a big difference. Despite my desire to help others and do what is right, I can't help but want something for myself, to have as my own. Perhaps it is just my idealistic self that longs for something so pure and perfect as true love. Someargue that it doesn't evenexist, butI have hope. Some would say it is becauseI have yet to feel the pain of true heartbreak,perhaps they are right. Maybe I am just asking for heartache, but, so be it.I am willing to try. I feel like I have so much to give, I just need to find someone who wants it and wants to love me back.It may sound stupid or silly, or even selfish butI can't help it, that's howI feel. Of course there are other things I want to do but as they say, love conquers all. I cannot wait to fall in love, I hope it is as wonderful as I imagine it to be. I know this sounds premature and I know I may have a long way to go and there may be many guys in between but I believe I will get there someday. *sigh* I hope so...  Other things I plan to do (just the big stuff): I want to finish college with honors and a good golf record. I want to join the Peace Corps and travel to 3rd world countries and use my aquired skills to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate than myself. I want to find a job where I can find joy and satisfaction in my work, helping others and making a difference in the world. I don't need to make a lot of money, just enough to live comfortably with my family. I believe that too much money is dangerous, and uneccisary. I want to fall in love with a man, get married and live a few years on our own before we start a family (to make sure we can provide a solid foundation to raise a child). Honestly, the thought of parenting scares the heck out of me. I don't know if I can handle it. I don't know, it's hard to say right now, but if I do decide to have children I would seriously consider adoption because there are millions of children that need a loving home and I would be honored and humbled to take one (or more) into my family.  Well, that's about as far as i've gotten with my future. I think that's pretty good, don't cha think? =P   That's about allI have to say for now. TTYL

      Love your neighbor as you would yourself. That is a quote from church this morning.   I really enjoyed church today, it was all about learning to love your neighbor and giving without asking to receive. We read the story of the good Samaritan who stops to help a man who was beaten and left for dead on the side of the road after the man was ignored by the first two passer-byes. He cleaned the man's wounds and took him to an Inn and paid for the Inn keeper to take care of him without asking for anything in return. Giving without asking for reciprocation...one of those lessons that's easy to learn but difficult to carry out.

      Jewel Foolish Games  You took your coat off and stood in the rain  You were always crazy like that  I watched from my window  Always felt I was outside looking in on you  You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair  You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  Besides some comment on the weather  Well in case you failed to notice, in case you failed to see  This is my heart bleeding before you, this is me down on my knees  These foolish games are tearing me apart  Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  You're breaking my heart  You were always brilliant in morning  Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee  You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you  You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones  As I clumsily strummed my guitar  You'd teach me of honest things  Things that were daring, things that were clean  Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean  So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself  These foolish games are tearing me apart  You're tearing me, tearing me, tearing me apart  Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  You're breaking my heart  You took off your coat and stood in the rain  You were always crazy like that  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  This is how I feel. If you want to know, ask.  When in doubt, speak. I dare you to prove me wrong.

      She will be loved  Maroon 5    Beauty queen of only eighteen  She had some trouble with herself  He was always there to help her  She always belonged to someone else    I drove for miles and miles  And wound up at your door  I've had you so many times but somehow  I want more    I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved  She will be loved    Tap on my window knock on my door  I want to make you feel beautiful  I know I tend to get insecure  It doesn't matter anymore    It's not always rainbows and butterflies  It's compromise that moves us along  My heart is full and my door's always open  You can come anytime you want    I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved  She will be loved    I know where you hide  Alone in your car  Know all of the things that make you who you are  I know that goodbye means nothing at all  Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls    I just heard this on the radio the other day and I really liked it. One of my first thoughtswas 'I wish (I had someonewho would do that forme).' I don't mean to sound self centered, justbeing honest. I haven't heard it since but it made a big first impression. It's a sad song, but it's pretty. The lyrics themselves are kind of confusing, at least I think so, but when I heard it that one time the meaning of the song seemed clear. *shrug* Check it out, see what you think. I wanted to post a link so you could listen to itbutI couldn't finda full copy of the song, sorry. Take care! TTYL
