      Have you noticed that all you see on the news now is bad things that are happening?  Like, I turn on the news and I see like what...3 Amber alerts in a week?  Why is this happening?  I think that this is because people don't know how sacred life is.  God gave you a chance to live and now all they want to do is make somebody elses' life hectic?  NO!!  I personally think that this world is turning into a horrible place.  I also wonder why people should be given a second chance.  For example, why should people that are put in jail be able to get out and start their lives over?  I think if you do something to get put in jail for, you should be kept there and not be given a chance to change what you have done.  Whether it is robbing a pop machine like my dad or killing somebody in a car "accident."  Yeah, so people should think about things they're going to do before they actually do them because think about the ones that get killed in every day situations...do they get a second chance in life?

        Ahh, the dreaded words that most look forward to. But is it really something to look forward to? At times, I think it is and at other times I think I'm not looking forward to it. I've thought about the relationships I've been in and have I really been "in love"? I'm not sure. As a teen myself, I wonder what love really means to us. Does it mean having a boyfriend and saying them three words I love you or is it being with somebody all the time and not being able to spend a minute apart? Is it always being happy with the special person in your life? I'm asking myself this question right now. WHAT IS LOVE? I think I'm at a very important and vulnerable stage in life. In my opinion, love is having somebody that always makes you smile, yet you have your differences and can work them out. Wanting to be with each otherwith long periods of time and never wanting to say goodbye. I have to admit, I have been through that. Yes, Ifigured out that I wasreally IN LOVE once and I think I still loveHIM! Now come the question of is he in love with me? I've told him my feelings many times andI'm not sure hetruly understands what he means to me.I know that he thinks he's in love with another girl, but how does he know we aren't still in love unless he gives "US" another chance? He doesn't and that right there is what makes me wonder how genuine he is. Heis always there making me smile, but he's probably there for a lot ofgirls to make them smile.All these questions have led me to think about himan extraamount lately. I want him to be happy and he thinks that thewith the girl he is with now makes him happy. Itdoesn't make me happy, it makes me angry. She can't realize howgood she has it. He's everything to a lot of girls and she is blessed to have him there for her. I'dkill to have him inmy life again, butI'm scared thatit isn't going to happen. Should I be scared?That's another question I've been asking myself inside. I'm not even sure what to do at this point.I usuallyalways know what to do because he gives me advice, but now who's there to give me advice whenit's him I need advice for? Nobody really. Maybe somebody knows what I'm going through, but I'm not sure.He makes me ever so happy anddoesn't even realize it. Maybe when I'm not there anymore, he'll realize how much I really meant to him? No, NEVER!And do you know why this is? I'm never going to be able to leave himalone and never be there for him to make mego crazy! He's my everything. Everything I want and everything I could ever dream of.I want him with me, to hold me, to never let me go. He makes me feel safe, comfortable, and most of all HAPPY! Come baby, make me happy. I WANT TO BE HAPPY.

      Think about the love inside the strength of heart Think about the heroes saving life in the dark Climbing higher through the fire Time was running out Never knowing you weren't going to be coming down alive  But you still came back for me You were strong and you believed  Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong believe  Think about the chance I never had to say Thank you for giving up your life that day Never fearing only hearing voices calling out Let it all go the life that you know Just to bring them down alive  And you still came back for me You were strong and you believed  Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong believe  Wanna hold my wife when I get home Wanna tell my kids they'll neverk now How much I love to see them smile Wanna make a change right here right now Wanna live a life like you somehow Wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile  Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong believe  Yellowcard wrote that song and I believe that was about September 11th and I believe those were extremely heartfelt lyrics.  Alan Jackson also wrote a song about September 11th that touched my life and I'm glad that people realize how much of a hard time that experience has put on many people in AMERICA.  BEAUTIFUL AMERICA.  I do think America is a beautiful place to live and some people forget that.  You are blessed to live in this country and you should thank GOD everyday for having such an opportunity.  Yes, I'm extra patriotic today!!  :-D

      Alright, there is some things that are starting to get on my nerves about my life.  Some of those things are about to come out about right now when I tell you about them.    1. High School Drama.  I'm sick of the rumors, gossip, and immature little people who think they are better than people.  Honestly, who has the right to tell somebody that they are better than them or to even think they are better than somebody.  Everybody should be friends with everybody no matter their race, religion, looks, or family.  If somebodys wants to be your friend, give them a chance.  I've learned that somebody you think you could never possibly be friends with could become your best friend in the whole world.  Whether you think they are too good to be your friend or you think you're too good to talk to them, go up to them and say, "Hello, do you want to hang out sometime?"  You never know who could become a good friend.    2. Fake People.  Why do you have to act like somebody you're not.  There's nothing more that bothers me than somebody who tries to act like somebody they're not.  Let's have an example.  Lets pretend I have a friend that is very snooty to the girls that try to talk to her and she isn't very nice to girls.  But, when she is around guys, even if it isn't somebody she likes, she tries extra hard to act stupid so the guys will laugh at her stupidity.  Alright, lets say a guy tells a joke and she purposely says angelically, "I don't get it?"  That is what makes me the most angry about people.  Yes, this happens to me and I do have an EX friend that acts this way.  She just so happens to be my best friend since preschool.  It hurts to know that I can't get along with her anymore because she has changed so much and now acts like somebody she's not.  So please, nobody out there try to change the way you are and act the way you want.  You will find people in this world who will appreciate you for the way you act and won't expect you to be any different.    That's all I have to say for this post and I hope you enjoyed.  Take some of this advice I am giving out, it's here for a reason!!Later :-D </post></Blog>
