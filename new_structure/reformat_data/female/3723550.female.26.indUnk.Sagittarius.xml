I feel like not to see him, so I turned back and walk away.  Well, I met him only once, and that restaurant is so small,  I didn't feel like to say hi.    Then I went to Emporium, I feel like to eat BIG MEAT!  steak, burgur, something heavy, so well, I am quite bored  with what they have in Emporium, but I thought  "Greyhound Cafe" must have something.    Then, there is a sign in front of the door says    "We have kitchen problem today.  Sorry for inconvenience."    You won't encounter this kind of situation so often.  I just decided to go there for once in a few years...    Well, this is guuzen...

Bangkok is a very major touristic place. I see many tourists everyday on the street.  Thailand is great, people are smiling, food is good, everything is cheap... That's why Thailand is very popular destination for tourists.  It is a little bit different when you live in touristic place as an expat.  Well, TOKYO is also quite a big city, and that should attract many people from all over the world, but actually if you go to  Japan, you can see, still it is not so "tourist friendly" destination.  People don't speak English, scared to see? foreigners.. Especially if you go to Tokyo, maybe it is different in up-country side.  I hope every tourists who visit Japan will have good time.  Oh, also in Bangkok too!

Did I have "Zekkocho" time these days? Actually, I am not feeling "Zekkocho", but should be feel okay. I cannot get up early these days. I wake up around 7:30am. THAT'S WHY I AM NOT FEELING ZEKKOUCHO!  People says, if you can get up 2 hours earlier than usual, really early morning, you will feel really good and feel positive about everything.  I must be able to feel "ZEKKOUCHO" if I can get up early tomorrow morning...
