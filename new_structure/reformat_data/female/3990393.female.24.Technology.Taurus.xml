           my mom and i went shopping today.  While on our way home (heavy traffic as usual), momc was complaining of being caught in the middle of 2 vehicles coz she needs to be careful of both sides of the car..then I wondered if the inventor of the car already considered everything (such as the side and rearview mirrors) when he created it.  Then momc said that she was more impressed and amazed at the discovery of electricity and communication eqipment (such as phones, radios and computers)..how the former can bring light and power to things and the latter be so small yet so powerful that people all over the world can get connected in a single click or push of a button. And then I just kept on enumerating other amazing inventions and discoveries such as the rocket spaceships, airplanes, satellites, elements, atoms, medicines..and I just thought, wow! man is great..

       i love Fridays coz itâs our âdateâ day. we just went shopping at southmall. hon bought a pair of jeans and i went trying out denim capris which was exhausting coz all those I tried didnât fit me. we ate at sbarro (again!?!?!)..itâs so hard finding a place to eat at southmall. first we went to yellow cab but they didnât have a slice of the only pizza I like --pepperoni &amp;amp; mushroom--, and i donât wanna buy the whole 10â coz hon was on a diet. next we went to French Baker but pasta noodles and lasagna were not available..i sort of craved for don henricoâs but we still have to go to festi and I was so tired to travel anymore. when we decided to have mcdo, we passed by sbarro..and tadaa..we gave in to the smell of their pizza..

       just got interested in this blog thing..it seems kinda fun to do..   well, it was a rainy day today. lazy lazy day at work..we watched the "david blaine magic" on dvd this morning and it was amazing! there's this one lady he asked to think of a person's name,then a cab passed by and the name she was thinking was writtenat the back of the cab! creeepy! but i wasn't impressed on some ofthem coz i saw this show on studio23that revealed some of the magic tricks he did.   i got mad at hon coz he slept all afternoon..well, i understand that he was not able to get enough sleep last night but if he's going to do this everyday, imight as well work here at home than goto the office. but i'm glad we compromised on this issue.. right now i have nothing to do so i just started on this..hon was asking me to create a sort ofa diaryprogram in visual basicso we canrecord our happy moments together. i figured this blogspot can do for the meantime..hehehe..i don't have VB installed in my pc yet anyway..

       we watched stepford wives earlier and i feel that i was destined to watch it. the movie is all about perfection-- perfect relationship, perfect woman, perfect world. my hon and i have just been through a major fight (my previous blog) and honestly, a lot of things have changed and i havenât realized it til now.  we used to talk about plans on married life..the house, the car, the kids..and suddenly itâs just BAM! ok now what? confusion, doubts, fears, and uncertainties get in the picture.. i guess it all started with me. wanting the nearly perfect life, i became uncertain of the future due to reasons i have no control of. because of the fact that i am not getting any younger and i want to do things as planned, i came up with a spur of the moment decision to go out of the country to escape all these things that have been bothering me so much for the past few days. i want to get married to the man i love so much and i want to spend every moment of my life with no one else but himâ¦.but...  suddenly thereâs this word called âBUTâ..  a typical taurean, i have a hard time adjusting and dealing with change. i was so used to hon giving me all his attention and vice versa. then his friends cameâ¦.well i know that man needs friends..i mean i will definitely understand it if they will meet one time or another coz i also have friends who i would want to meet occasionally. but the âtambayâ thing became frequent and honestly, iâm not happy with it. the hon i used to have would turn down invitations of âtambayâ coz he would want to spend more time with me..the hon i have now canât. WHY? i dunno if iâm just being paranoid but right now, my stomachâs churning and i can feel the insecurities coming back.. know why? coz he was supposed to go here at my place to teach me programming in visual foxpro (coz we have the payroll project to be released on September and we barely even started on it) but his friends asked him to watch a movie and yeah, there he is right now, watching Aliens vs Predator. this bothered me a lot coz just a few days ago, we discussed that it was not a movie to watch and we would just waste our money on that. another thing is he was so exhausted and sleepy during our meeting at DSP coz he was not able to get enough sleep last night due to the revisions of our HR project. get the picture? i feel that he was becoming bored with me and heâs not happy with my company anymore..oh dear..=(  and sadly, i have to admit that the mean me is trying to take over the charming (hehe) me..i became irritable at the slightest disappointment, iâm becoming ill-tempered and i would say nasty things without really meaning itâ¦  itâs quite ironic, right? yesterday i was so happy that everythingâs just the way they are after our fight..but here i am all confused and worried. gosh, i feelâ¦â¦â¦aaaargh..i dunno! iâm pushing my mind to think of happy thoughts but it canât..i feel sick..my whole bodyâs numb..tears are pouring down...i dunno what to think anymore..helllpp!!!!  to me, what we have is perfect, we are so in love with each other and thatâs it, thatâs what made this perfectâ¦and i really hope that it will continue to be soâ¦  btw, i've had one happy thought just as i was about to end this...he gave me flowers this morning and it was really sweet of him..i miss him..hope he'll be home soon..

       yesterday was one of the worst days of my life. i was so confused and disappointed with the way things have been going with me, my honey, our business, and other stuff. i figured thereâs something really really wrong with me, iâve been a selfish B***H.....yesterday went by with me ignoring my honeyâs efforts of bringing me back to my old charming self (hehe..) later in the evening, my attitude drove him so crazy that he wanted to go out and drive and think..of course i begged him not to go coz we passed by 2 accidents on our way home from makati..omens i think. and i canât help but cry of worry at the thought of him driving alone. it was almost 12AM when he called me and said that we both go to bed coz we have an early meeting. as i was about to end the call, i heard him say to his bro that if in case i call, tell me that he was already asleep coz heâll be going to his friendâs house (which he admitted was not true coz he really planned to go to starbucks) and i was so shocked to hear that he lied to me! to think that he sweared he wonât go out anymore! and suddenly my blood rushed to my head and..oh gosh..is he always doing this to me? are the things heâs saying and swearing to me all lies? a lot of thoughts kept playing on my mind..what if i didnât hear him say that and he did go out for a drive and something bad happened? oh goodness! i was so mad and i told him i hated him so much coz heâs a liar..then he said that it was stupid of him to do that and that he doesnât want to talk to me and see me anymore coz he was so ashamed of what he did..  but anyway, as my blog title states..itâs all over..whew! minutes after saying that he doesnât want to talk to me or see me anymore, he called me (hehe..he canât stand it..) and i just cried there listening to his apologies and thinking how much i canât let him go in spite of this..  today really went fine, itâs as if nothing happened (except that my eyes were so puffy i had to wear sunglasses during our meeting at st. andrewâs) i first thought that it wonât be nice to post our fight here but then i realized that the worst moments are to be treasured along with the best moments coz this is what makes our relationship strong..some proof that we will make this work no matter what. the good thing here is we both realized our mistakes and we just canât give up this great thing that we have just because of one lousy lie and weâve both learned to forgive the otherâs fault no matter how painful it was. well, itâs actually kind of a minor problem compared to what others go through..the complication and all. i guess we just donât have anything major to fight about anymore..and i agree with the clichÃ© that fights/arguments from time to time are needed in order to make a relationship work. =)  hmm..this is actually not related to my blog but i canât help but rave that Yellow Cab pamplona branch (just outside our village) is now open and thatâs where we had our  âlunckâ âcombination of lunch and snackâearlier. in case ur wonderin where i got the  âlunckâ  word..i dunno..i actually dunno if thereâs such a word..i just made it up coz we had our lunch at 4PM (blame the very tight schedule..tsk tsk..) and i thought that if thereâs such a thing as  âbrunchâ  then this may be âlunckâ..hehehheâ¦anyway, going back to yellow cab, they really have the best tasting pizza ever! just take a look at this (drool)â¦   urlLink    yummy pizza at yellow cab..

       it's a saturday and i'm here in our office, having a chat with my friends thru YM..hehe, saturdays are "petiks" day. i miss globalink (my previous employer) and my friends there. i remember we would always go to work at 8am so we could be out at 12..and we would just surf the net and chat for the whole 4 hrs since the bosses are not around. oh well, that's what i'm currently doing, surfing and chatting, and posting here..coz i'm the boss (haha!) except that we have so much to do and we have a tight schedule next week with the trainings, meetings and all..whew! omigosh, i just remembered i still have a number of tasks to complete before monday's training. gotta go..

           whew! we just got home from trece marirez, cavite..a long way from here but itâs worth the travel.  it was so scary going there coz there were no lamp posts on the road. well, knowing that San Miguelâs the interested client, weâre willing to take the risk..actually i was a bit disappointed to find out that the meeting place was just a small hardware store but it turned out that this was only an introduction to our contacts and that the next meeting/s will be at the Laguna plant of San Miguel. if this project will proceed, i think this will be the start of something big for Soft Solutions.  we already have well-known clients such as DHL, Royal Cargo, Daiwa Seiko, Philexport and Europ Assistance..hoping to add San Miguel to that! hehehe..we really should be getting a new office and hire additional programmers.   God is really so good..He keeps on giving us many blessings and guiding us all the way thatâs why iâm really very thankful to Him.  before, i used to complain of problems that come my way or things that i canât or donât have but now i learned to be more thankful of what i have and of what i am. i learned to accept that problems are just trials or obstacles i need to surpass in order to be more worthy and deserving of the good things that are about to come.  i must admit that i was such an insecure person during my younger years..i used to think that i was such a nobody (maybe it was the way that i was raised) and this feeling led me to become a pleaser coz i want people to appreciate me and the things i can do.  but ever since i met my honey, those insecurities slowly disappeared coz finally i got this one person who completely appreciates me and all my flaws.  =)

           =( Hon got mad at me..sigh..im so so sad. My head is throbbing right now and I canât sleep even though I feel so exhausted coz I really miss my honey. I so wanted to talk to him..=( anyway, itâs still quite early and I hope Iâll be able to speak to him before the day ends..that is before 12AM..sigh..  Busy day today..we had a meeting at Daiwa Seiko Corp. in Laguna from 1 to 4 but we left early to get some tax return forms from BIR. My hon and I enjoyed our lunch at Jollibee Shell SLEX station because they had some leather couches..like the ones found in coffee houses..and itâs so comfortable, we even took some pics..hehe..weâre so mababaw talga.  At Daiwa Seiko, we checked the Biometric Timekeeping kiosk, trained the users on how to log for attendance, and discussed the revisions for the HR Dynamics software and the scope of the Payroll software coz sir eric already gave us the GO signal to start the project..yay! tess (the payroll staff) is so nice..we were delighted with her coz she learns the software fast, and sheâs so kind and easy to talk to. She even shared with us the companyâs problems with their employees when we were having our snack.
