       We had our convocation this Sundayâ¦ and now, I can officially call myself a post graduateâ¦ well, I shouldâve blogged this yesterday, but I am sure the fresh memories would remain fresh for days to comeâ¦ and one day wouldnât really make a differenceâ¦   The atmosphere was simply one of its kindâ¦ for someone like me who has never experienced a convocation before (mine was one of those colleges that couriered our degree certificates home!!), it was excitement at its peakâ¦ getting the degree itself was a thrilling momentâ¦ and getting a medal was even better! With most of my thoughts focused on how I should avoid a fall with my saree, and some of them on how I shouldnât turn away from the photographer making his life miserableâ¦ it was great fun altogetherâ¦   The morning was filled with feel-good reunions happeningâ¦ Since we were meeting our batch-mates after more than six months, we were busy finding out who has put on weightâ¦ and then getting tips from the lucky ones who have managed to lose a few pounds! And then meeting friendsâ families, about whom we would have heard a zillion anecdotesâ¦ but coming face to face for the first timeâ¦   Meeting up with professors was even more thrillingâ¦ one Prof remarked to my mom that he canât resist teasing meâ¦ and was pulling my leg in the company of my parents! And our Director didnât miss his chance, and remarked that I looked like one more âmamiâ in a sari! And that he took time to recognize me!  I am glad that my emotions did not take the better of me while in collegeâ¦ but they did, when I reached homeâ¦ I was still sinking in the fact that 2 years had flewn by jus like thatâ¦ I could not think of anything elseâ¦ and I think itâs quite naturalâ¦ all those good old days and good timesâ¦ my mind was bombarded with a million memoriesâ¦ and cherishable momentsâ¦   Right from the intro sessions on day oneâ¦ to getting to memorize a hundred plus namesâ¦ with surnames..;) And then the freshersâ party that made me a singer overnight! And those assignments and surprise testsâ¦ those night outs at the collegeâ¦ catching up some early morning sleep at the reception before the next class startsâ¦ Not to forget those times when the north Indians were driven to nuts by some âsoundsâ from the tamiliansâ¦ and the late night âdiscussionsâ, that were colloquially âVeKuâs (an abbreviation for âvetti kootamâ in Tamil)â¦   And then some stuff exclusive to IIITB â¦ like seeing yourself sleeping on the big screen, thanks to the cameras from all cornersâ¦ and being looked at like zoo inmates by some n number of visitors everydayâ¦ and then watching cricket matches in an atmosphere that could beat any stadium hands downâ¦ having greats like Richard Stallman in front of our eyesâ¦ and many many moreâ¦   And continuing the excitement yesterday, was the papers, carrying a snap of our batchâ¦ so finally I have achieved something remarkable â my foto in the dayâs paper! And that too in the same frame as some of the greatest luminaries of our time! And some potentialWell jokes apart, the tears of joy and sparkles of pride in my momâs eyes definitely made me feel like an achieverâ¦ and this day would be etched in our minds for the rest of our livesâ¦

      Until recently, I have always felt credit cards are a pain in the wrongest of placesâ¦ this is essentially bcoz of my dadâ¦ the only thing I remember about him and cards, is that more often than not, he gets charged extra and ends up blasting the bank executive left right and centerâ¦ this is quite a common sight in my house, after he gets the monthly billâ¦ my dad would religiously call up the bank, and demand for an explanationâ¦ and this ofcourse, knowing very well that his efforts would go in vainâ¦   But then recently, I was forced to go in for a credit cardâ¦ all I wanted to do was get a mobile connection, and I was deprived of one bcoz I did not have a card!! And the connection providers wouldnât give a damn even if I showed them my salary slip, employment contract and a âdecentâ bank balance tooâ¦ all they want is a credit card in my name, so that the liability gets shifted to the bankâ¦ now thatâs what you call trusting people!  I had called up this guy, who was selling credit cards for a renowned bankâ¦ actually I didnât call him up myselfâ¦ when I was bombarded with calls from the bank, I asked them to send a representativeâ¦ he was there promptly at my officeâ¦ and made me fill up some forms, and get some n number of documents, each for a different purposeâ¦ one would verify my address, my identity, so on and so forthâ¦ and then when he left, he promised that I would be getting my card within 3 weeksâ¦ as in, latest by 3 weeksâ¦   So I was all hopeful of getting this new credit cardâ¦ and I had opted for a card with my foto on itâ¦ to get the cheap thrill of seeing myself, everytime I shop with it!  Actually 5 weeks have passed, and I have been desperately trying to contact this guyâ¦ who had played the fool with meâ¦ I tried calling him up, and it wasnât of any useâ¦ and then yday, I was too happy to spot him in my office receptionâ¦ and was even happier that he acknowledged me with a smile! Thank goodness, there were still some traces of hope leftâ¦  He was actually talking to another potential customer, when I met himâ¦ and I asked him what had happened to my cardâ¦ can anyone guess what I wouldâve got for an answer? I didnât expect it even in the wildest of my dreamsâ¦ With a great amount of hesitation, he told me that he had changed banksâ¦ and was selling the cards of another bank nowâ¦ all I could do was laugh aloud at thisâ¦   And even worse, was that he started explaining to me the benefits of this new card of this new bankâ¦ he hardly gave me any time to thinkâ¦ and proceeded with his marketing speechâ¦ guess thatâs how they are trained, to effectively make use of a customerâs weak moment!  I was insisting that I was more interested in the âotherâ bankâs cardâ¦ and he too, with all skills of persuasion, was reiterating that the new bankâs card is equally goodâ¦ actually he said it was even better! The bottomline was that I wanted a card only to get my phone connection doneâ¦ I had no intentions whatsoever of using that card for anything other than paying my telephone bills, and in that case, the bank name really didnât matter at allâ¦ but then, the older card had only some half a dozen varietiesâ¦ like Gold, Silver, Platinum etc etcâ¦ and the new bank had a card named after virtually every element in Mendeleevâs tableâ¦ so that made me nearly faint!  By then I had lost all hopes of getting that cardâ¦ but on top of my mind was that I had wasted a passport size snap for this! And I also managed to get the phone connection, saying that I have applied for the card and would produce it âASAPâ..;) But the funniest part isâ¦ my mobile connection also got cut today, thanks to the excess bill that I have incurred in my maiden month of usage!

      Over the past month or so, the only thing I have been doing in all the time that I have is attending trainingâ¦ and it can be logically inferred from the above statement that I have ceased to think for quite a while nowâ¦ day in and day out, I come to office, keep staring at my trainer, take in some stuff of what he/she says, leaving out most of the stuff.. doze off in betweenâ¦ and at the end of the day feel kind of insaneâ¦ I have to get back to chatting, checking mails and blogging after the training schedule daily, or else this feeling of insanity jus increasesâ¦   In between this absolutely interesting schedule, yesterday I was talking to this friend of mine after quite a few monthsâ¦ he had attended an interview for a job, and I was enquiring how it went and stuffâ¦  He said it went on fine, and posed one of the interview questions before meâ¦ there is this popular belief in my class that I am good (relatively...;) when it comes to problem solving, hence that question was being posed to meâ¦ I could not answer it at first shot, but I am glad it made me dust out my thinking faculties and do some productive workâ¦    After kind of arriving at an answer, but not quite convinced with myself, I wanted to verify it with my other friend, a genius in his own rightâ¦ What ensued was an interesting discussion between us, me being a silent listener for most part of it, and he doing quite a bit of discovery into this stuffâ¦   The question was thus, âhow do you plant four trees such that each is equidistant from the other three?â The answer of course was that it was not feasibleâ¦ that we knew when we started the discussion itselfâ¦ but I am glad that it was a welcome break from the boring schedule that I normally haveâ¦   What made the discussion all the more worthwhile, was that I was doing all this sitting right under the nose of my trainer! My trainer probably thought  was typing some code only with so much enthu... While I was enjoying typing some mails...   If this was early in the morning, the afternoon session was even better... I had a partner in crime, who was sharing my system... and instead of being attentive in the class, he was entertaining me by providing puzzles to solve... He got a peek into my frame of mind, thanks to the sites that I was browsing... And after noticing me spend significant time in some math sites, he was giving me puzzles himself... And thanks to him, at the end of the day, my sanity is safe and sound... Atleast, I feel so...  I feel its only things like this that help break the monotony of corporate life... Or maybe I am feeling the monotony a little too much, thanks to the very recent transition from student life to corporate life... Tomorrow is yet another loooooong day ahead!
