      Dearest shadow,   I havenât been blogging for a few days. My sincere apologies. Just have no energy and desire to blog. Wanted to tell you an incident that happened yesterday. I was as usual at the banner. Painting it. And I forgot to call and inform my mum that I will be late. So, she called. And it was close to 10. I had to umâ¦..tell her aâ¦â¦lieâ¦that I was already walking out of college. Then I went to wash my handsâ¦was full of paint and someone picked up my phone when it rang. I think it was ash. And when she heard a guy pick up, she would have had her suspicions. And then later, when she called again, my hands were still full of paint and I asked vin to help me press answer and put it to my ear. Then again, she heard guys voices over the phone and she started to suspect all kinds of things. Scolded me real bad. I cried real bad there. I was at breaking point yesterday and when such an incident happened, I just couldnât take it. The banner still remains unfinished. There are the orchids to finish. And so much of touching up to do. And to think that I have been staying back to do this bannerâ¦.getting so much of scoldingâ¦and pushing myself to breaking point. I just donât get itâ¦why am I even doing this? I keep asking myself the same damn question over and over whenever I walk out to wash my hands. I see gabe, my frensâ¦all studyingâ¦ and here I am, two weeks of tutorials all piled up. Werk is piled up sky high. I just donât know when to start and when to finish. I know this sounds crazyâ¦.but I miss studying. I miss writing a long long GP essay. Cant wait to get the show over and done withâ¦resume life as a PJC muggerâ¦.adopting my mottoâ¦while I live, I stone.   Mother tongue work is piled up. Am worried only for that. Manikam will just strangle me if I say I was busy with the banner. What am I to do? I feel so helplessâ¦.and it feels like I got no one to talk to. Joyce is no more in college. My cookie darling is also leaving. I feel so alone. So vulnerable. Everything seems so intimidating. How am I even supposed to imagine how life is gonna change without that girl sitting in geog lecture? That familiar voice screaming chocoâ¦.the canoe girlâ¦..things are gonna be very diff. And even though I know her only a few months, it feels like a lot. And it made an impact. Thanks cookie. Just do what you love. I am behind you. Am gonna cry soon if I continue. Lets skip topic.   I talked to joyce yesterday. I guess I made the poor girl cry. I poured everything out. And I did feel betterâ¦..i made her cry though. Felt bad for that. Me exchanged phone with J today!!! Camera phoneâ¦.was glad that I could have it for a whole day and keep playing with the camera. YAY!!! Long time wish came true. Haha. Cukoo me. I know. Need to regain my sanity soon. Wait a minute. I think I lost it the moment I stepped into PJ on the 22nd of march. Oh well. i shall persevere and learn how to cope.   For it is in my learning that I live.   So clichÃ©....   Haha..   Nites.  Bubbye   P.S. i am not sane. dont mind my post : )

      Dearest shadow,                            Yesterday was mother tongue day. Was a very nice day for me...me wore saree. Green one. Real nice and light to wear. i have since changed my opinion of wearing a saree....it aint thaat bad I have to say. I think the food stalls made some money...and the talentime was just fine....vin sang my favourite song. His voice is real nice you know. I was mesmerized...oh yaaa...i forgot to mention...i wore heels yesterday...kinda high larr...summore I am tall :) initially I wasnât able to get used to the height.....suddenly the eye level in which i saw everything was different....so weird..had to hold on to ash when I walked...and this gabe saw me holding on to him at the ramp..ayioh...I no need to say...I think he start to speculate. oh well...that is sooooo like him. Haha..  I didnât pack my bag that day..and I forgot to bring my PW stuffâ¦and to think I scheduled a meeting on sat..everyone was probably verry pissed with me..my secretaryâs boyfren was also there. I felt real bad. I made them wait..and end up, I didnât have the stuff. Still feel bad. Has happened a few times. I guess I have to be more careful. I have to get the report done by the end of today..and I have A math today. Didnât practice. Havenât done a single question in the ten year series. I better buck up. I know that. Seem to have very little time. All my tutorials are piled up. So tired larrr. All I am doing these days is complain complain and complain. I seem to be missing something in my life....I think itâs the music. Whenever I am sick of werk, me go to the piano...and play a few notes. I feel better. Rejuvenated. Can carry on. Sigh. Am waiting. The month better end soon. Otherwise, I am gonna suffer from depression soon.  Mum was nice to me yesterday and today. Something thatâs not the normâ¦.i guess I havenât been arguing with her. No energy to do so anyway.  Slept late last night...was online..only shashi and my sayang online. Sayang left....only shashi was online in my contact list...tok tok tok...then....go to sleeep. Btw, sorry yar shashi..me was having headache....guess I bored you on the phone..and wasted your money..  slept at near to one....still sleepy.  What happened to the song in my blog?? Not werking!!! I want it back!!!  I suppose thatâs all I have to blabber for todayâ¦  Bubbye now.

      Hey there shadow. . .     I didnât blog in a few daysâ¦ didnât have time. Sorry yarr. Me will try to squeeze it all in ok?? Lets begin    Mondayâ¦.  Me didnât go to collegeâ¦officially that isâ¦went over at 2. by right I had PW, Geo, Lit  Mass pe. But I didnât go for a single one. Oh wellâ¦who cares? Me? Nahâ¦.then as usual, painted the bannerâ¦.i guess you are sick reading bout the bannerâ¦I am sick painting it too..this is the bigger banner. 2nd one. It covers the back bart of the hallâ¦.sooo big lehâ¦    Tuesdayâ¦.  Normal dayâ¦.except that it seemed like Monday. Man I hate it when it seems like Monday all week. Mon and tues are the days where I have the longest daysâ¦yuck. And the Pw on both days just pisses me offâ¦its like I have to have a meeting no matter what. And on tues, we had a collaboration. My group got this comment.. âthey are simply lost!â oh yeaâ¦easy for you to say. The lady with the farnie voiceâ¦in charge of Pw, and two others were observing us. Helloo????? How am I supposed to conduct a meeting with three members and three teacher staring at me?? Goodnessâ¦and the minute I stop, the pens stop moving!!! Its intimidating larrrâ¦.my secretary writes EVERYTHING down. It aint a bad thing. aint a good thing either. Wont go into that. Then, that day, I left college at 10. finished some part of the banner.    Wednesday  Another day as a pjc muggerâ¦all I can do is struggle. My grades for mid year released today. Its really easy to remember. FOC.    A friend and I had this conversation.    HEYY!!! so how your results???  Oh..me? I got an F for Econsâ¦.  Gosh! And??  C for MT litâ¦.  Ohhhâ¦  Thatâ¦I got got Geog. O.    And she just burst out laughing. Turns out she flunked her exams too. Hers is FOO. Sheesh! I got mad that she laughed @ my resultsâ¦ but then, at least I made someone laugh. : ) shdnt take such things seriously I sâpose.  Accidentally poured thinner on my handsâ¦about half a 1 litre bottle. My hands just got burnt. Terrible pain I tell you. And I got sensitve skin summoreâ¦.left relatively earlyâ¦.9. took bus with vin  reached home. Didnât eat the whole day. Forgot cash.      Thursâ¦.thats todayâ¦  Left earlyâ¦.didnt paint at all. Had A math todayâ¦me fed vin and ash chicken rice. They were more than happy to eatâ¦I felt happy too. Me forgot cash today also. Must draw out tmrw. Talked to someone today. Turns out someone owns a blog tooâ¦will go see laterâ¦ Will blog more tmrwâ¦if I have time that isâ¦.very tired.    Nitesâ¦

      Hey there shadowâ¦.  Me very sick today also. Having a bad headache. Went to school today. Gave my secretary the laptop and then went for CCA meeting. I donât know my purpose in being there. I didnât do much there also. I didnât go for vina class today. Feel bad about it. Guess she would have taught the last part of the keertiâ¦ itâs a very beautiful song. The tune constantly runs in my head. But only part of itâ¦.i guess I have some catching up to doâ¦the last part is like the last piece of the jigsaw. Havenât fit it in yet. The tune I hum is unfinished.   PW is in an okok shape right now. I have burdened my wonderful secretary. Am such a lousy leader. Oh wellâ¦.i got no choice.   Am tired. Got no energy to rant. Will finish here. Guess itâs a break for youâ¦read a short post for todayâ¦   bubbye

         âOn Avaricâs white plain,    where an icarus now wings  To steeps of Terrain  from Tour-of-the-Kings  And damozels twice-seven   his brides have all become:  A far cry from heaven,   a long road home â  Then strong-hoof of a starhorse   must hallow him unguessed  If adamantâs edge is to plunder   his chest.  Then, only, may the Warhorse   and Warrior arise  To rally the warhosts, and thunder   the skies.  But first there must assemble   ones icari would claim.  A bride in the temple   must enter the flame,  With steeds found for six brothers, beyond   a dust deepsea,  And new arrows reckoned, a wand   given wings â  That when a princess-royalâs   to have tasted of the tree,  Then far from Esternesseâs   city, these things:  A gathering of gargoyles,    a feasting on the stone,  The Witch of Westernesseâs   hag overthrown.  Whereafter shall commence   such a cruel sorceress War,  To wrest recompense   for a land leaguered sore.  With her broadsword Bright Burning,   the shadow Black-as-Night,  From exile returning,   shall dare dragonsâ might  For love of one above who, flag unfurled,   lone must stand,  The pearl of the soul of the world   in her hand.  When Winterock to water   falls flooding, foes to drown,  Ravennaâs own daughter   shall kindle the crown.â

ALOT. i owe ya alot i suppose. and i hate to owe things. well...things like this happen right...end up doing things you hate. like PW. oh well. pray for me.  nites. bubbye

      hey there shadow.                  i am particulary pissed today. if you dont like me when i am not in a good mood...its a good idea to stop now.  alright then. I shall begin to rant. Today is a super long day. And when I mean super longâ¦..its SUPER LONG!!! Me came bek at 9.50pm today. Ate dinner and then here I am. As usual, I have the Monday blues. And today is no different. I got back my Lit paper today. Wasnât a pretty sight. I know that my paper has been marked very very very leniently and yet I managed to score a miserable 47 for 4 of the questions. The last question wasnât markedâ¦..that means that my paper was so terrible that it wasnât worth marking till the end. Fine. My fault. I did read the book ok. I did. Then I cut mass pe today. But with the teachers permission of courseâ¦she told me that I have to make it up for herâ¦.alrightâ¦and you wanna know my make up PE??? 8 rounds round the track..8 rounds dammit. Youâd probably be thinking why I was so stupid as to cut class and tell my teacher and summore get a make up pe lesson. Well wellâ¦what can I say??? The banner remains unfinished. And we were supposed to hang it up today. Still undone. There is 2 more to doâ¦12 meters by 218 cm??? Think it can be done??? I really hope so. And if I hadnât told mrs lohâ¦.manikam will be after meâ¦ rather run the 8 rounds than to stand outside the pulse [the posh word for the staff room in my college.] and get a lashing from him. Me went to lot 1â¦got them some foodâ¦ came bekâ¦.paint and add glitter. Till this point, things are near perfect. And I am still in a jolly mood. Câmon with vin and ash ardâ¦..and their dirty jokes, one has to be anti social to be in a bad mood. I washed upâ¦..in the guys changing room with those two and then left school at 9+. When I reached the interchangeâ¦.i saw the looooong queue for the 300. my goodnessssâ¦It went all the way to the macdonalds in the mrt station. It was that long you know. as usual I cannot wait. Then I overtook this one bastard and crossed the road in my usual fashionâ¦.not at the traffic lightâ¦and yeaaâ¦ me leave it at that. I know Iâd get a scolding from nanda.  Once me reached the busstopâ¦.the bastardâ¦.put his smelly plastic bag next to me and walk ard the cement thingy that hold the MRT up [I know this is rather crude English. Just adjust ok?] and then he started talking to meâ¦.some moron trying to sweet talk me in the middle of nowhereâ¦what?? Gimme a break larrâ¦and he looked absolutely filthy I tell ya. The fucker probably trying to get my handphone number. Asked me to send ringtone to him. What the??? Totally nutty fella. Then I half screamed at him. And thenâ¦after this looooong pauseâ¦he still got the cheek to tell me to give him my number so that he can send me ringtone. That really made me blow. I screamed at his faceâ¦.and asked him if he wants to spend some time in jail for harassmentâ¦.the asshole face changed. Luckily this pregnant lady sat next to meâ¦.and he cldnt move his filthy plastic bag closer to me. She kept looking at my school logoâ¦.then she smiled. That sorta cooled me downâ¦.then I took the busâ¦that moron also got in.....ask my bro to fetch me bek homeâ¦.haizzzz  Life. Such useless beings still existâ¦you know, I donât agree with the men are from mars and women are from venus thingyâ¦.i think women are from earth and men??? From the other side of the milky wayâ¦.or maybe the 10th planet that was found recentlyâ¦.SETNA!!!! I hereby change the sloganâ¦men are from SETNA and women are from earthâ¦jesus!!! Speaking of whoâ¦I didnât call caroline. I have enough things on my hand already. I know jesus knows that and I hope the lord forgives meâ¦.aint my fault. I just got no time!!!! And nowâ¦..the stupid PW is pending. Goodnessssssssss!!!!  I got lots to rant. Am never finished. But it seems too longâ¦me will stop here.  Nites Bubbye

      Hey there dearestâ¦                   Didnât blog in a 2 days...right now, I am stuck in a crisis...I cant ask anyone about the outcome of it eitherâ¦how? Tomorrow is Monday...another week starts. Can I ask? Should I ask? Maybe its not inappropriate. Well, I know myself. If I were to make a comment or express my opinion...then things are going to get ugly. And the worst part is that its regarding some other people...but I have known about it and yet...I didnât attempt to warn or advice or at least tell them to be careful... so is it my fault? If the parents come looking for me how? Its gonna look like I actually âendorsedâ the problem. Am I annoying you by not telling what its about? Well I am sorry. The nature of this thingy is like that. I cant say it out. Its not about me...somebody else.  Oh wel... all I can do is pray. Am not stuck in this sticky mess because of my fault anyway. Its their âfaultâ. Personally I wont call it a fault. Its just a false sense of security. A sense of superiority. The alter ego took control. Hiazz. These things happening at a time like this. Seriously I just donât know what to do. Am so overworked and now there is an extra problem to bug me. Here I am tell nanda to sleep early...but I am sleepin so late. Even when werk is done [which is neverending by the way] I keep thinking and thinking late into the night. Cant seem to stop thinking all kind of weird things. They just pop up when its nite time...the only time I entertain all these thoughts is at nite...so...I guess they get blown out of proportion by that time...paranoia sets in.   That aside...the lady who I met at wisma called me when I was having A math. Her name is caroline. Sweet lady. I told her that I am not in. She ask me to pass a message to myself to tell me to ring her. Confusing eh? Ya.  Iâm wondering if I should give her a ring. She wants to um...sell me tickets to this church play. I dont mind going. But I dont have time on my hands right now. Neither do I have the money to buy it. My tutor said âyou lied.â And that made me feel kinda bad. Actually I feel guilty. REAL guilty... you know... I think I am becoming this very emotional person. Its not necessarily bad. It just feels weird larr. Verrry weird. And I got so much to say these days. Think I have really gone nuts. You think so??? I seem to think so.  Someone told me my blog looks boring. Its too plain  too white they say. This is what I have to say: this is MY blog....i repeat  MY  blog. If you think its boring. Donât come here. If you think the song it too slow...turn your volume down. You cant switch it off anyway. If I sound too clichÃ©, donât read. In short, get lost if you think I suck along with my blog. What you see...is what you get. I donât fake my posts...and I dont need to write fancifully coz I aint that kinda person.  End of message...  Yet again, i have finished narrating my boring life to you. If you are here already...Thanks for reading. If you were waiting to condemn, you can do so now.  bubbye.

      hi shadow...             once again i am here to rant...haizzz. oh well..things didnt go well AT ALL today...first my tamil AO oral...that was baaaad i tell ya...baaad... felt like scum after it. these two men...one wearing pink and one wearing green. like the traffic signal like that..only difference....the one in green wasnt a go signal...it was a "you are gonna die" signal. that guy was from RAffles junior...and the pink guy was okok. was from national junior.. what the??? pioneer is just a lil....lil small thingy in comparison to them...and their standard of tamil is soooooo high..i couldnt believe that it was tamil..goodnessss!!!!  felt like i was reading some ancient scroll from egypt or sth...sheesh... thennn..after oral...me went up to see how the banner is coming along. went up and saw that was in good condition...so i thought i'd make a trip to town and see how my phone is coming along.... went to wisma...and guess what..i ran into these pple who preach christianity....i nearly knocked down this salesgurl in topshop and in my haste...i stepped on this gorgeous top that was on the floor...ran into them...and the thing they ask me is...  "hi miss. do you believe in god?" "um...yaaa...why?" "would you have a minute by the way?" "a min??? yep i do." "do you know who is jesus?" "ya...he's the man who died on the cross" "WOW! thats a good start.." [start to what? i think] "would you like to invite him into your life and make him your best friend?" "um...like..." "its really easy!!" "oh well..go ahead.." "repeat after me then..." *they held my hand and began to say this super long prayer...i swear it was like 5 mins long...* "amen" "Amen" [i said that..after so long...] aaaand the conversation continues....one minute became 5...then 10...then 15...you get the idea.... they made a prayer for my exam...and then i was finally released...dont get me wrong. i do go to church and all...i do pray to jesus....this time though, jesus caught me in the wrong place at the wrong time...after my "liberation" i went to the 4th floor only to find the siemens center closed...the sony phone relocated to inside isetan...and the siemens center wasnt there!!!! god!!! i wasted my time travelling and walking in the rain!!! fine..i was still cool then...then i took 190 @ the busstop behind ngee ann city...and this woman poked me in a sensitive place with the back of her umbrella...ouch! how can i possibly tahan a blow to my ahem...assets..in the middle of the road??? damn...it was painful. it subsided after what seemed like eternity..[somewhere in the middle of the expressway] went bek to college...lend a hand in painting the banner...this bitch was there making a hella noise...i still tahan..and refused to believe i was havin a bad day. after those toots went off...i begun the work on the middle part of the 7m banner...the paint hadnt dried...and i actually sat on it!!!! there was this BIG fluorescent yellow, letter D on the back of my skirt.  GREATTTT!! how am i supposed to go home? the rest were just laughing...so sad...lucky i had pe...wore my pe shorts and shirt... used an old cloth to wipe paint off..getting the paint off with turpentine was the easy part...getting the smell out is another story...pple literally moved away from me in the bus...i guess i stank along with the skirt....paint on my face..neck...arms...must have looked like a sri lankan maid. came home late...had A math...and then...wash wash and wash my skirt. it still stinks. i guess i'd have to settle for pants tmrw. i think i did have a bad day...havent recovered from my streak of bad luck.   but one thing or rather one person made me happy.  Sri.  thanks gurl...i do need help with math..suck at it...someday dear...me hope you are doing just fine with your bro overseas... i guess you miss him huh...suppose shakespeare was right when he said absence makes the heart grow fonder. i hope its true too.  long long long post. hand pain. i think your eyes pain. cannot type anymore...sleep is lingering at my eyelids...threatening to close em shut... ...think i'm starting to blabber ready...better chao now  bubbye..and nites

      hey there shadow..                   here i am once again...on a different looking blog...well lemme get to werk thenn..today me went to college ALTHOUGH it was marking day...so the day started at 8 am for me...and then we started doing the publicity banner and that took so long to do...finished at 6 but only a lil bit of that herculean task was finished...just drawing the lines with that tailors chalk for that 12m cloth is hell i tell ya...and this year is the 5th anniversary...the minister is coming to "grace" this joyous celebration....Mr balaji Sadasivan...that bald man who is the minister of state, health and transport. and to think that i have to stand next to that man and pass him the prizes for the event. *shudders* and that too in a saree that is as long as the publicity banner itself...sheesh man..but i guess i'd do alright. we did the banner till only the guest of honours name...the rest remains for tomorrow...i guess we have to skip breaks again to get werk going...we didnt eat today also...waste time larr...eat and eat..werk not done..sigh..  Tmrw college reopens...so its back to the black hole called JC..kena sucked back in..mass lectures....mass PE...Mass everything awaits...how joyful...i'd be getting bek my papers tmrw... i guess my GP paper wldnt look so bad but the rest....i aint too optimistic..well whats done is done...all i can do is loook to the future...[looks bleak now..]  by the way, dont wonder why i deleted my old blog..just a split second decision....i'd keep changing the skin of it as and when i feel like...so dont be alarmed to see my posts missing or my blog in a teruk condition..it just means that the blog came under my never ending quest for perfection and learning...meddling with the codes is interesting you know...you shd try mess things up and then make em ok again...releases stress. and you learn sth new in the process.."WHILE I LIVE, I LEARN" well....what can i say....the pjc motto just inspires me!   hahahahahahahahah  its been very long since i laughed. : )  later.

      Hi shadowâ¦..                        Had a particularly different day today. Didnât take PE today. Something out of the norm. when I wanted to go to the changing rooms to changeâ¦I took the route from the tutorial rooms to the track areaâ¦.and I passed somethingâ¦.from the corner of my eye, I saw something familiar. Beautiful, familiar handwriting in orangeâ¦.something that I had been looking at. I clutched my file closer to me and strained my eyes to see what was writtenâ¦I couldnât help but tear upâ¦then, I was forcefully pulled away from the noticeboardâ¦.  breakâ¦was unconsciously looking for someoneâ¦saw the gang of ppleâ¦but no special someoneâ¦no canoe girlâ¦.no appetite..  geog lectureâ¦againâ¦was looking for the creature wearing blue tinted glassesâ¦no cookieâ¦then It dawned upon me. Sheâs already goneâ¦did badly in the stupid quizâ¦câmonâ¦..who cares what china did for their one child policy? Not meâ¦.  Tried doing the Mt compoâ¦still havenât finish.  And by the wayâ¦..i think I am possessiveâ¦.OVERpossessive at that. me aware that it aint good. But cant help it. It hurts. Painful lehâ¦to seeâ¦.or let someone slip by..guess itâs a part of life..i have to accept as I grw upâ¦.  But I donât wanna grw upâ¦..everâ¦.its nicer this wayâ¦the innocenceâ¦.joyâ¦loveâ¦carefree...everything seems niceâ¦  Sighâ¦time cant stand stillâ¦wish it didâ¦then can rewind backâ¦  Bubbyee.

      Hey there shadowâ¦                                  Me went out todayâ¦to causewayâ¦met ash, Vicky  miya at their polyâ¦then we go together gether to buy present for someoneâ¦just came backâ¦havenât finish my homwerk yetâ¦greatâ¦the procrastinator me..   Oh and yaa!!! Forgot to mentionâ¦you see, on Sunday I had this really bad dream about pap. Then I woke upâ¦went toiletâ¦came back and sleepâ¦the next morning, I got a call from the personâ¦I knew that it will be the person even before my phone rangâ¦but hey..i also knew what the person would be sayingâ¦.so I just didnât pick up the phoneâ¦.first my handphone rangâ¦then my house phone. Both instances also i didnât pick up. Just had that sick feeling when the phone rangâ¦and guess what?? When I went to poly todayâ¦I just topped up ash cardâ¦thenâ¦we were walking outâ¦chattingâ¦and this familiar voiceâ¦  âoh my god? Is that gayathri?â âum..yea..â [aint super happy] âwhat you doing here?â [you mean?? I cannot be here w/o your permission? Sheesh!] âvery hungry lar..came to eatâ¦â [I pointed sooo obviously at the poly..] âgoing to meet Vicky issit?â âyeaâ¦â [I looked at her friendâ¦dressed like a bitch..] âoh..this is my fren..her name is ________â [ who gives a shit about her name?] âoh hi..â [sarcasm just oozing from my tone..] âok laâ¦we going now..byeâ âbyeâ¦â  then I felt like scumâ¦why did I even have to bump into her on that day??? I know I just blanched when I saw her. Just hope that she didnât notice itâ¦hope it wasnât obviousâ¦.  K me ask one thingâ¦am I just bitching around??? Or being a snob?? Or something else altogether? Wellâ¦â¦...i donât know myselfâ¦I guess its just a ego thing. yes you heard me rightâ¦.EGO.. If you start the damn fight, you jolly well say sorry. Donât wait for soooo long to say itâ¦and if you donât, just go your own way. And let me go mine. BUT never never never expect me to call..and say sorry. That happens only when I am in the wrongâ¦and I feel that you truly deserve my apology. But I have to admitâ¦.i havenât really stopped feeling guiltyâ¦  Oh wellâ¦I guess I need to recoverâ¦and right now, I have more important things to think aboutâ¦like my tamil projectâ¦unfinished econsâ¦god!! Two essaysâ¦andâ¦4 gp newsweekâ¦and Christ knows what.   Outta here.  bubbyee

       Hey there dearest.                             Me just had PTC today. Feeling not so good. Had it in the middle of tamil lit class. Went back for lit after PTC was over. Jeg messaged me that everything will be fine. I hoped so. But well, I did get screwed. Nevermind. If I donât wake up now, then when am I going to? Its my fault la. I have to stop fooling around. FOCâ¦if it continues in this wayâ¦the inevitableâ¦..retain. gulp......boy..i hate that word. Had a bad enough experience already. Not ready to go through the same thing yet again. parents didnât really scold. I believe they got sick of scolding meâ¦.i can understand.  Honestly, I havenât been myself lately. Paranoiaâ¦.it really sucks. Sighâ¦.oh well, sorry for being so melancholic these days.    No mood ready.    Bubbye now...

       Hello shadowâ¦                           Today is cookieâs last day in college. Sheâs going away. To penang. That meansâ¦.next Monday is gonna be   extra blue   for me. No cookie.  I get this sinking feeling. Like I just lost something dear. I suppose I didâ¦someone dear. A part of me. Nothing is permanent. Have realized that.  Let me get to business thenâ¦ There was no A math yesterdayâ¦.stayed in skool till 9. Went home late. Followed ash home. Saw gabe. I got a bit angry at something he said. And I sort of lashed out at him. Sorry for saying that gabe. It just got to my head. Please donât do that again. truly sorry. Got a bad nagging from parents. Donât use your authority on me. It doesnât work. Tell me nicely. I am nice to pple who are nice. They said something that I didnât doâ¦I just donât like that. if I get scolding for something that I didnât do, I will just do it. And then accept that I made a mistake. Same thing goes for the hooking. When I donât hookâ¦donât tell me i that did and keep harping on it. I will just do it. There and then. And I think it was embarrassing for the poor fella. That was what got to me. I know I am being a bitch. Cant help it. Cant be bothered either.  By the way, I am a DI. Same as cookie. Kewl ar? Yeaâ¦sister mahâ¦  Went to town today. After begging so many people to come with meâ¦I finally went today. Bought the bag I wanted. And it was a super fast trip to town. Was really nice of Jeg to come with me. Thanks ya. Hope the stuff you want to buy turns up somewhere.  Have ptc tmrwâ¦donât know how that is going to beâ¦have lit. am going to miss 4 weeks of music classes in a row. I miss it. The light feeling after I play. Havenât been able to touch my instrument. Havenât been able to blog : (  I think I am making a mistake somewhere. Nono. I know I am making a mistake. It seems to make me happyâ¦but makes me feel guilty also. I hope I am not crossing any limits here. Someone better tell me If I am.  Blabbered a lot today. Enough said.  Bubbye.

      dearest shadow, i think i have a lot to say today. i am relaxed today. got only tutorials to clear from today on. the aadiperrukku is over. yesterday was a day that i will never ever forget in my life. memorable. has made a deep cut in my heart. here i was constantly complaining about the banner and the size of the event....the minister coming...and wonder when the day would end. and yet, when the event was over, i was actually wishing that i could turn back the time, go back to it and do it flawlessly. yes. you guessed it. there were lots of flaws. they happened beyond the control of everyone. the prize presentation, something that i was in charge of, was a real big problem. whatever we gave out was correct though. i am thankful for that. but well, things like this happen. i wasnt even able to talk to vicky. and yesss did i mention?? i saw nesh! i have always wanted to talk to nesh for so long. i got my wish. thanks to the lord.. i was blessed. what happened after the event was the thing that made an impression.  after i changed, the make up just l0oked out of place. hair in a mess. was hungry. ate backstage with jeg. was really nice to talk. for once, someone who bothered to   listen   to this small, skinny girl people didnt really consider significant. felt a little lighter after talking some things out. then, there was a debrief. manikam wasnt angry. he was just disappointed. i know. and strangely, i was able to identify with that feeling.  when all was packed up, and we were at the concourse, manikam was there too. and he was talking to us about the event. he cried. i always thought that he was this really headstrong man. discplinarian.strict. no nonsense. but i was wrong.   TOTALLY   wrong. it was really wierd. i felt guilty. as he talked, i realised things that i never even bothered to entertain in my small, closed world. honestly, i was viewing the world in a stereotyped manner. anything that didnt fit into my stereotype, i dont entertain. my mind was open yesterday. i was truly listening. i couldnt help but cry as he narrated some things to us. i was sitting the closest to him. and seeing such a formidable figure shed tears, i felt helpless myself. went home feeling profoundly full of confidence. that i can achieve if i wanted. so far, i had only been saying these things to myself. now i know the true meaning. i guess you are wondering what happened and why i am talking all this stuff. a life changing experience occured yesterday. and i told him sorrry for making him cry. felt bad.  when we can stage such a big show with cooperation, we can get countless A's also.. i totally agree.    i made a decision yesterday. concerning a very important dramatis persona who graces the stage of my life. many scences revolve about the person. to put it simply, i have decided to let go. dont get me wrong. i am not attached. just let the person slip by. a conscious decision i have made. its gonna hurt. i did have a choice. and made mine.      i think i am growing up. talkin very seriously these days.      haha. am truly laughin today.      bubbye shadow.
