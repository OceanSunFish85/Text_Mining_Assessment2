       have you ever noticed...   that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them. and when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?   have you ever wondered...   which hurts the most; saying something you wished you hadn't or saying nothing and wishing you had?i guess the most important things are the hardest to say. they are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them, words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they are brought out.   don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.   if you do, they might break your heart, but if you don't, you might break theirs.have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were afraid of losing what you had with that person?your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't. you can't tell your heart what to do. it does it on its own; when you least suspect it, or even when you dont want it to.   have you ever wanted to love someone with everything that you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?   too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever, or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watched him/her fall for someone else?have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  we tell lies when we are afraid, afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us...  ...but everytime we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.   life is all about risks.   don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have had, or could have had.   no one waits forever...
