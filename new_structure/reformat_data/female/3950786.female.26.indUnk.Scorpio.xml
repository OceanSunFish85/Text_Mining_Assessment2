        I never felt alone, I was happy on my own. And who would ever know there was something missing.I guess I didn't see the possibility. It was waiting all the time but it never crossed my mind till you opened up my eyes.  Now all I think about is you in my life, in my dreams, in my heart I know it's true that I belong with you.  Because of you in my world, in my arms, I have everything and now I can't imagine what I'd do...without you    I never thought that love could be such a curiosity. What attracted you to me was so unexpected. But it was waiting all the time and it never crossed my mind until you opened up my eyes.       TDVC: done!
