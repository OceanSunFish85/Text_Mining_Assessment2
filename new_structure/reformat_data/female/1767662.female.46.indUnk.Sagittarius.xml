      so, apparently, the mountain decided to come to me:  I decided to skip the hanging out for tonight (the rule is only âfive days a weekâ and Iâm due for a rest) and went straight to the gym.  A man whom I shall call BEC (Brazilian Eye Candy) waved a cheery hello (he used to barely acknowledge my existence) and lo and behold, long lost Freddy reappeared while I was doing my ab work and said, âWe really have to get together and have a drink sometime.  I really want to do that.â  âWhy donât you just call me?â I said, switch from abs to a split âin secondeâ (as we used to say in the ballet world).  âYou gotta give me your number.â  So thereâs gonna be cocktails in my near future.  I sure hope so.

      Was it on purpose that he sat directly in my line of vision?  (I sure hope so.)  Vanilla latte was tasty.  Made phone calls.  (Jaelyn was home, Joey wasnât.)  Iâm beginning to feel like a regular.  Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.  Except nobody does (yet).

      who has thinning hair and is rather average-looking.  I turned my rapt attention to yesterdayâs crossword puzzle.  I got my jollies earlier, when my very nice-looking downstairs neighbor told me I looked nice.

      but that just wasnât happening.  So, after the gym, I switched bags and went to the Blockheads at WWP for late lunch and a margarita.  Yeah, again, I was the only person sitting alone, but Iâm over it.  Donât have the energy to generate anxiety over it, not when the sun is shining and itâs warm and Iâm reading a book set in ancient Persia, laden with exotic colors and textures and romance and intrigue.  Not to mention the margarita, which was just right.  Beef picadillo burrito was pretty tasty, too.  As I left, I saw a man sitting off to the side of the plaza. âWow, now that is a handsome man!â  thought I.  He looked up at me, and I sort of smiled as I passed.  I went maybe ten steps further and then I thought, âHmm.  I wonder if heâs still looking at me?â  I made no effort to be subtle or coy, I just turned around.  He wasâ¦ and sort of smiling.

       urlLink I took myself for a walk around Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO , and capped it off by treating myself to a stop at  urlLink Jacques Torres Chocolate Factory .  Then I went to Kishaâs under the pretense that it was all about seeing the HBO preview of a film that Stephanie was in called âEveryday People,â but when our family gets togetherâ¦  As I said to Candy one day this week:  âWhenever two or more of us are gathered in His Name, there is schtick.â  Made friends with a friend of Stephanieâs, and recommended Mary (and Ballet Hispanico) to the mother of a precious, energetic little girl.  Tried (with Alvin) to convince Aunt Millie to writer her memoirs.

      I havenât given up; but I did âtake offâ on Thursday and yesterday, I went to see ABTâs Coppelia (Iâm not bloggingânot here, anywayâthe stuff that falls into the category of âPlay Date.â)  But I guess after a week or so I should review:  No Prince Charming.  No Mr. Right.  Or Mr. Right-Now.  But I did finish my book, finally try out the juice bar down 9th Avenue [aside:  I hate when people say âaveâ instead of âavenueâas if they would say âstâ for âstreetââand so Iâve taken to spelling out âavenueâ all the time as my own stand against literary laziness.] and discover Starbucks Vanilla Lattes.  And I feel my habit shifting.  I can zone out and relax in public the same way I do at home covered in cat hair.  Hmm.  Is zoning out in public a good thing?  Would the sort of guy Iâd like walk up to a girl like me whoâs muttering over a crossword puzzle?  I wish I had a secret camera trained on myself so I could judge for myself what Iâm projecting.

      I would have wanted to hang out somewhere and âmulti-taskâ (sip a Starbucks Vanilla Latte while reading a book) even if I didnât have this project to consider.  Good thing, because the only conversation I had with a stranger was with the security guard who told me that I shouldnât put my feet up on the chair.  âSorry,â I say.  âThank you, I appreciate it.â  Eh.  It matters not.  The book Iâm reading is titled, âRevenge of a Middle-Aged Womanâ and Iâm getting to the revenge part.

      I knew there was some sort of juice bar down Ninth Avenue, but I thought it was closer than 45th St.  No matter.  As I walk through the door, it occurs to me that there is no great nobility in being decisive about what sort of designer smoothie I want.  So I might as well bat my eyes and flirt a little.  I smile up to the counter and say, âWhat I really want isâ¦ coffee, but Iâm trying to be good.  What do you suggest to pep me up?â  As if I couldnât read the menu on the wall myself.  He was not an exceptional-looking young man, but cute enough.  He stumbled over his words a bit as he recommended a blueberry-banana-protein-and-B-vitamins concoction.  I like blueberries.  I like bananas.  Sure, give me one of those.  [Fast forward to 10pm, as I type this entry.  For those of you old enough to remember F Troop, picture the spin of the camera before Agarn snaps his head around and asks OâRourke âWho says Iâm dumb??!!!â]  Wait a minute!  Was that stuttering me making him feel flustered?  But I wasnât even wearing mascara!    B-Witched.  Thatâs the drink he recommended.  Hubba, hubba, Cynthia!

      iced, this time.  I had removed my watch when I came home from work and my phone had flaked out and needed to be reset so I had no idea how long I was out and I had to guess when it was time to go downstairs for my Pilates class.  The pathetic thing was that nobody sat close enough to me, nobody paid me enough attention that I could lean over and quietly say, âExcuse me, but do you have the time?â  Boy.  At least the Iced Vanilla Latte was yummyâI think it may just be my new taste treat of the summer.

      It was full.  Bustling.  Why, today of all days, when Iâm most likely to notice and be disheartened, was I the onlyonlyonly person eating alone?  Why, also (but this oneâs not rhetorical) did Konradâs smile turn a little south as I sat down?  As if it took a moment to register that I came to eat, not to visit?  Not that I didnât want to visit, butâ¦ did I make a faux pas by choosing a seat in the middle of the restaurant, not adjacent to âhisâ corner?  I feel  like I inadvertently somehow made the âwrongâ (i.e., not friendly neighbor) choice.  And since I kept my nose in my book (desperately trying to camouflage the mist that welled up in my eyes when the heroineâs cat died) and I didnât visit/chat, do I still get my Â½ hour credit?

      Nah, I think not, because Iâm unashamedly in escape-from-work mode, not sit-and-find-a-stranger-to-talk-to mode.  But after work!  I got home at 5:30 and Jeez, but I really wasnât enthusiastic about reassigning perfectly good couch time to the outside world, but I rode my sense of discipline to the Starbucks (Coffee Pot just ainât what it used to be) for a Vanilla Latte and the AOL crossword puzzle.

      Nice enough weather.  Low 70âs.  A bit muggy.  I took my book and my Clementine to Worldwide Plaza and sat out and had a snack before my workout (and sauna).  I had the sense not to hope/expect Prince Charming to come clip-clopping on his white horse down 49th Street, making an illegal right onto a pedestrian plaza to rescue me fromâ¦. fromâ¦ the picnic table at which I was sitting.  I was already somewhere other than on my couch with my cats, so thatâs something.  The clementine was sweet and tasty, and later, on the elliptical trainer, Iâd blot my face and could smell citrus faintly through the towel.

      Current physical fitness wisdom says that I should exercise at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week to stay healthy, stay strong, pep up my heart and lungs, keep my metabolism zippyâ¦ all that good stuff.  Well, I do all that.  And I have the butt that JLo is dreaming of having when she gets to be my age.  And I look good in a miniskirt.  And my aortic valves beat a strong, steady rhythm.  Kinda like Charlie Watts.  Or maybe Ringo Starr.  But definitely not anyone crazy or dead like Keith Moon.  (Really.   I saw my echocardiogram once and it looked like a drummer keeping a solid 4/4 rock-n-roll beat).  So my body is in great shape.  Whatâs not in such great shape is my social life.  (Social?  What a weenie-assed euphemism, Cynthia!  Your social lifeâi.e., with your friendsâis terrific.  Itâs your sexâoops!  My mother reads this stuff:  Sorry, Mommie, I meant âromantic,â or maybe âpersonalâ life that sucks!âas if using the word âsucksâ here connotes language that is somehow more Mother appropriate.  Never mind).    So Iâm wondering:  will the same theory work here?  Thirty minutes a day, five days a week?  I go to Google.  There are âthirty minutes a dayâ theories and programs for improving everything from cardiovascular health to Greek pronunciation to mediation practice to piano-playing to sentence structure (sentence structure???) to PMS â¦ oh, wait, here it is:  The Social Anxiety Institute (How is it that a person with social anxiety could get it together to form an institute and I canât find a boyfriend?  Again, never mind.)  Okay.  Maybe Iâll give this a go.  No, not the Social Anxiety Institute audio therapy program.  But maybeâ¦  Thirty minutes a day, five days a weekâ¦  I know I need to go out more.  But I donât especially like bars (or even strangers, for that matter, but thatâs what weâre here to work on, isnât it?)  So, where to go, what to do?  Merely being out of the house isnât enough.  Iâm not going to strike up a conversation while Iâm toodling down the bike path, I canât talk and pedal at the same time (or maybe I could.  Note to selfâ¦).  I need a plan:  I canât rely on myself to go where my whimsy takes me because my whimsy takes me shopping and Iâm definitely not going to meet the man of my dreams trolling the aisles at Sephora.  I have to go where the boys are and where I kinda feel like I can be doing something soâs I feel occupied, but not so focused on my activity that I canât be interrupted.  (Complicated?  Insanity usually is.)  Crossword puzzles, cheesy books, spurts of furious notes in my low-rent Staples notebook.  Give me props!  Conversation starters!  Security blankets!  Dramatic devices!  Okay.  So letâs see where this takes me.

      The weather sucked, I'm sleep-deprived and I have a headache and I went out to Starbucks anyway and ordered a black coffee which was not the best thing for my stomach.  Nevermind. Tomorrow this time I'll be in Atlantic City in my dinner dress either nursing a girly drink or playing my niece's numbers at the roulette table.

      Freddy finally answered my e-mail and said that heâd had a GREAT (emphasis his) time. The voice of the insecure teenager says, âWell, why  doesn't  he check his e-mail every day? And maybe he does but he just wanted to make me wait and wonder if he  really  had such a good time, and why doesnât heâ¦â  The 46-year-old pre-menopausal old broad listens patiently to the post-pubescent babbling for as long as she can. I mean, this is, of course, my own inner adolescent speaking, I should give the kid a break and let her vent. The patience lasts for maybe 30 seconds. Old Broad then yawns and thinks, âYeah, well, whatever.â Which is not to suggest that the boyâs  not  a hottie and I  donât  care to see him nakedâor, for that matter, that I have âem lined up to ride the Cynthia Roller Coaster in case this one wanders away. Itâs just that as I get older I canât manage the hysterical drama. Is it wisdom or is it weariness that leads me to spare the emotional energy for a situation that truly calls for it? And all this situation requires is the proverbial cold shower.

      Perhaps my problem is genetic. I sent my mother a clipping about the death of  urlLink Illinois Jacquet , jazz bandleader who, as recently as a week and a half ago, played closing night at Midsummer Night's Swing at Lincoln Center. This is how she responded:  I didn't hear anything about his death. Thanks for letting me know. I saw him a few times in my life, at a dance when I was about 19 There were gobs of fellows at this affair, and they all stood around and watched the Lionel Hampton play and never asked any of us girls to dance. I was so disgusted even though the music was good.  Just so there's no mistaking what those idiots were ignoring, here's a picture of my mother taken around that time.  urlLink     urlLink     If the XY's of her era didn't ask  this babe  to dance, what hope is there for me?

      "You know, with an entree, you can hae a mimosa, champagne, bloody mary, anything you want, all unlimited." In that case, I'll have another mimosa. "That's what I'm tryin' to say." You're a wonderful man. He flashes me a peace sign. He was not yet born when the formerly V-for-victory-hand gesture became a Peace Sign. But, unlike the zillionth resurrection of platform shoes or miniskirts, this is not a mindlessly retro re-hashing of the previously hip. I think it still means what it did in the Summer of Love. But what do I know about the Summer of Love? I was nine-and-a-half and in day camp and we took a week-long road trip to (there's a tune to this, but if you don't know it, it's not that important) "Come one, come all, to Expo 67 Montreal!"  All this from my second-choice entree (they were fresh out of smoked salmon for eggs benedict) at HK, the hippish, newish diner on 39th  9th, right at the corner of the newish, reborn Hell's Kitchen Flea Market. It was a perfect day for brunch--with unlimited (I had 2) mimosas--and the entire 39th Street side of the restaurant was open like a garage door and I spent an hour in the sun reading and daydreaming.

      Straight Man  [Recently Ended A Capital-âRâ-Relationship]  asks, âWhatâs the point of having a Relationship?   Straight Woman #1  [Relationship On The Skids]  says, âTo have someone to talk to, and bounce ideas off ofâ¦ and to have sex.â  [The âFriends Who Fuckâ paradigm.]     Straight Woman #2  [Me. Looking for a Relationship]  says, âI want someone who yins when I yang and yangs when I yin.â   Straight Woman #3  [Relationship happy and healthy]  saysâ¦ well, she gets a little starry-eyed and babbles a bit about âintimacyâ in a way that makes no intellectual sense but perfect emotional sense; then she gets it in a nutshell: âItâs when you can wake up at 2am and have a goofy conversation and itâs okay.â   Straight Women #s1-3 gang up on Straight Man and demand, âYour turn!

      I sat out at Rock Center and read for about 15 minutes--10 minutes after the cute  urlLink  tadpole  got up and wandered away. Then I went off to the Green Market in front of 30 Rock and bought apricots and plums and apple cider donuts.   I could have hung out at WWP before the gym, but I really wasn't feeling it. I had forgotten... until  after  the two cosmopolitans I drank last night... that I had an 8am dentist appointment today.   Okay. So no partial credit. I'll take my demerit and get on with my life.

      I have to write this before the alcohol wears off and I get shy again: Freddy. Good-looking enough hanging out at the sauna. He is, with a couple of pink beverages, mood lighting and the right angle, breathtakingly handsome. And he carries a briefcase with an appropriately silly cow pattern. And he only copped a feel once.  We had drinks and snacks at the barlounge at the Time Hotel on 49th Street. I'd wanted to go there for a while--since I'd scoped it out for the TFC Holiday Party. So it was nice to have a reason to slap on some spackle and lipstick and go there for a drink with a cute boy and have good conversation and lotsa laffs.

      Have I mentioned that I'm getting a lot of good reading done?   Sat out at WWP reading a book and looking up frequently to see if there was anyone around that I could hope would be looking back. All I got was a glimpse of the scraggly twin of the handsome man I sometimes see there.  Have I mentioned that the book I'm reading is really good? A collection of essays called  Off Ramps  by this newspaper features writer who digs stories of normal life in the american heartland. Like a lady in Baltimore who owns a waterbed store. Or the groupies who follow the touring company of Jesus Christ Superstar. And the guy who draws Wonder Woman.  All delightful bits of conversation starters, should I ever care to do that.

      Iâve been away for a few days. Literally, not figuratively. Went to visit Brian and Rick for the weekend. I must ask myself before I continue: does this have anything to do with 30MAD? Well, yes: Friday evening was a cookout where I socialized with a whole bunch of people I had only met once before and, even though I was the only heterosexual person of the bunch, had a marvelous time and was invited to some other guestsâ August pig roast. (I e-mailed Rick to tell him that I would try to come out for that event... And I decided to leave in the unintended double-entendre.) Going out for Saturday breakfast, I ignore my New York armor and let the folks in the Plumstead Bakery chat me up. I checked my voice mail and found a message from Freddy, so I called him back. Heâs in PA too, but further north, getting ready to mow his motherâs lawn (Thatâs a good son. I like men who treat their mothers well.). Later in the afternoon, the white-haired tree landscaper guy âhit on meâ (Thatâs what Rick said). What surprised me about my own reaction is that I thought he was just being a charming older man in the tradition of charming-European-older-gentlemanliness. Never mind that he was zillionth generation Bucks Countyâonly left twice: once to visit New York, once to visit Paris, and hated them both.    So, really Sunday was the only day in the last three where I didnât really extend myself sociallyâ¦ unless you count the âcat whisperingâ with BRâs new kitten, Junior. Hmm. And even him, I got to purr for me. So I took today off from non-mandatory social interaction.

      I was going to sit at Rock Center but then I saw tents set up in front of 30 Rock and I went to check it out.  A Greenmarket.  I bought peaches (which I'm told are "spectacular" but I've been eating junque food instead).  Then I had my usual Starbucks Iced Latte (Mocha today) at WWP.  But there wasn't even anyone cute hanging out.  (Except for me, she said.)

      I felt like calling Freddy, so I called Freddy.  OK, so it wasnât quite so effortless, but I only agonized for 5 minutes over whether or not I âshouldâ call him, what I wanted his response to be, re-questioning my motivations, imagining and dissecting his possible reactions and rehearsing my re-reactions, in the attempt to decide whether or notâ¦ aw, hell, Cynthia, pick up the damned phone!  So much easier to do whatever the hell I feel like doing than to waste time in âpreviews,â as if I couldâor even, now that I think about it, do I want to?âbe the only mind involved in the scripting of my life.   Relationships, Cynthia.  It means somebody else is doing whatever the hell they want, too, and you decide, âOK, cool.â  And then I went to the Coffee Pot (not Starbucks this time:  I felt like sitting on a couch, but since I had to leave the house...) and overheard what sounded like a blind date taking place right in front of me (coulda been; I remember that CP has some sort of agreement with Drip, the dating cafÃ© on the upper west side).  Well, it was either that or some sort of interviewâ-which is exactly what I donât like about âdates.â  I always feel like I should be asking some set of specific questionsâ¦ direct, pre-constructed, getting-to-know-you-questions.  [Make here a contemptuous sound by protruding the tongue between the lips and expelling air forcefully to produce a vibration]  I might as well just review resumes.  What I really want to know about someoneâs personality is whether or not they pick up on the song cues in life.  Some comedian used to tell a joke about looking for gays in the military:   âYou walk up to a guy and say, âClang!  Clang!  Clang!â and if he goes âWent the trolley!â you found him!â   Well, how do I reduce everything I want in a man to one song cue, one, perfect Rorshach-inkblot-free-association query?  Or do I really just the sort of man who would suddenly point out to me that the man sitting in the corner muttering and waving his hands is talking to himself in ASL?

      Chris and I e-mailed back  forth about going riding togetherâsometime.  Weather report for Sunday looked ideal to me.  Sunday morning I wrote:  âItâs 8:18am.  Iâll be leaving the house around 10-10:30.  Call if you can make it.â  10:45 I hit the road, and it is a gorgeous day for a ride.  Get down to the tippy-tip of Manhattan and check my messages, return call.  I find a shady spot, crack open a book (looks like a winner, by the way), and wait for my new friend to join me.  ********************************************  I think Iâm getting more comfortable with rambling, with running off at the mouth around people Iâm just getting to know.  Or maybe itâs just that I call it ârunning off at the mouthâ because itâs not some serious discussion, debate, or capital-C-Conversation, as if capital-C-Conversation was what was called for on a sunny Sunday afternoon, rather than running off at the mouth.  (Does it seem like Iâve completely switched topics?  Going from the middle of describing the event to evaluating my overall performance?  Whatever.  The rest of the ride was pleasantly uneventful.  Or maybe uneventfully pleasant.  And whatever it was, the experience ultimately was destined primarily to be a social lesson for Cynthia.)  Iâm almost ready to say that itâs because if it turns out that my ramblings are uninteresting, itâs because Iâm feeling uninspired, and if I someone doesnât inspire me (enough, at least, for me remain convinced of my own wit and brilliance), then we neednât spend a whole lot of time together, need we?  That looks so good on paper, somebody please tell me that thatâs true.

      I was just about ready to kick back and nurse a lonely, dingy gray mood.  I had been planning to meet Ana and Ned and go see Brazilian stuff at Summerstage, but thanks to last minute errands (Hercules was out of prescription food and I really donât want his pee-pee to get clogged) and retarded cell service (I left 2 messages for Anaâwhich she probably STILL hasnât receivedâand she left one for me at 6:10âwhich I got  at 6:45), I figured I was going to have to spend my Friday night watching TLC makeover showsâ¦ aloneâ¦ again.  But after I get back from the gym (step, step, grumble, grumble; and 1 and 2 and scowl and frown; 100 sit-ups, fussfussfuss and fumefumefume; now stre-e-e-tch and POUT!), my cellphone rings and Ana chirps, âCynthia, where are you?!â  So I kick off my flip-flops slide into my Rockport sandals and zip out the door to meet them at the west 72nd Dallas BBQ.  There were two (straight) guys with them:   Chris, whom I'd met a couple times before, and  urlLink Dave ; the three guys stayed at the bar to watch the end of an inning while Ana and I were seated.  So I shouldnât have been surprised that baseball statistics and lore emerged from the deepest recesses of my memory.  I even pulled out Buddyâs âTed Klewziewski Story.â  What a (pardon my pun) hit!

      (I got myself so agitated, I almost forgot about  today's  entry!)  There had been an attractive young suit sitting next to me reading "How Stressed Are You" in Men's Health magazine.  He's been replaced by a woman inexplicably dressed in hospital scrubs (hospital scrubs at Rock Center???) and she's scribbling as furiously in her notebook as I am in mine.  Tourists stop -- a little too close to me, as if I weren't there -- and look past me to the tropical flowers at the base of the palm trees, and I notice how wonderful they smell.

      I got the following from a guy to whom I e-mailed some pictures I had taken: i was reading some of your blogger stuff, and then i went to your place, I mean the link to @ cynthia's place and noticed a photo of what i presume to be your bike. my first thought was where do you like to bike?  My  first thought was:  âFinally!  A nice straight man and it occurs to him to get to know me via my writing and my photographs!â  But then I thought, âOh no!  How can I blog about chasing boys when the boys I  might  be chasing  might  be reading the blog?  Will they think Iâm not serious?  Will they think Iâm just floozy-ing around?  How much do I care?â  Well, maybe not so much â at least regarding whether or not they think Iâm a floozy (in fact, find me a straight man who uses the word âfloozyâ in casual conversation and have him stand next to me at your next cocktail party).  What I  do  care about is the possibility that someone I sort of like and Iâm trying to get to know will feel particularly mistrustful, wary, or, if after-the-fact, exposed or betrayed because he knows I'm writing about it here.    However  , this is  my  blog and itâs about  me  and  I'm  trying to figure out how I fit into the "relationship" universe by examining my own behavior and experiences.  And I canât censor myself, or let myself weasel out of being honest, or be afraid of the repurcussions of my own truthfulness (you thought I was going to use the word "honest" again, didn't you?)   Since Iâm not a particularly mean and hurtful person (uhm, most of the timeâ¦), I must assume that anyone who reads this is looking for the unexpurgated story of Cynthia's search for Love.  If you want my expurgated life, stick to @ Cynthiaâs Place.  I pretty stuff up before I publish there.

       urlLink This chick  has  taken money  from trusting people in return for her services as a âdating coachâ and sheâs only now trying to get married and has the nerve to complain about how hard it is to meet people?   Ya know,  I wish  this knowledge gave me a sense of commiseration, a little âmisery loves companyâ kinda thing.  But shit!  She pisses me off!  She pisses me off because Iâm chronically single and wondering whatâs wrong with me and wondering if I really should take a course, hire a coach, go to a singles nightâ¦ and people  have given her money for her to tell them to do things that donât even work for her .  (Never mind that she came across on TV as a whiny princess.)

      It was lunchtime and I needed to get out of the office.  I really wanted to take a walk, but I was too hungry and lightheaded (what's the use of a granola bar at 11am if your stomach is growling again at noon?) so I decided to sit at Food World (the new mega-deli across the street that used to be a Duane Reade) and play with my crossword puzzle while I nibbled on pepper steak and snow peas.  It was certainly a nice break in my day, but, now that I think about it, my Prince Charming does not eat lunch at Food World.

      after stretching a little cardio and some situps into a 75-minute workout.  I sat on the far side of the fountain hoping Bruno would not see me on his way out (What's he doing down here anyway?  He said the other day that a Bally's had opened up  near him  on Fordham Road  in the Bronx! ), and hoping further that the good-looking man with the salt-and-pepper hair (not the one from last week, another one) sitting 4 tables away will look up, recognize my face from the gym, and give me a little smile.  (Better luck next time, Cynthia.)  All this makes me wonder if I am at once both reverting to teenage boy-craziness, and stepping outside this reverted self to let the 46-year-old woman intellectualize about, experiement with, and report back to herself on such boy-craziness.  Complicated?  Well, yes; insanity usually is.

      when the bowl of Cheerios I'd had for breakfast suddenly wore off.  Since these days I'm not sure exactly what's causing my recurring dizzy spells, I decided against my usual Saturday-at-the-Greenmarket apple cider donut fix.  So I pulled out the granola bar that lived at the bottom of my bag.  As I struggled to open it (how come one can never open a mere candy wrapper when one's stomach is growling?) the lightbulb blinked on.  Why, I could actually  go into  Union Square Park, sit on a bench in the sun, and enjoy my granola bar in leisure.  Brilliant!  The USqP habitues seem an even more varied group than the regulars at World Wide Plaza.  Some guy was handing out slick-looking magazines and, unlike anyone else within my eyesight, I took one:  LaRouche 2004.  Isn't he one of those perpetual presidential candidates?  Yeah.  Seems to think everyone else is the devil incarnate.  It would have been fun if he had come back to talk to me about it.  I would have debated first the existence of the "devil" and if I didn't believe in the devil I couldn't accept the position that some mere human was the incarnation of something I didn't believe to exist.  I would have laughed to myself and winked at my fellow park-sitters as I played... hmm?  Devil's Advocate????

      Wait.  Back up.  Yes, Freddy called and yes, weâre tentatively having drinks tomorrow night after the gym (if I get out of work in timeâIâm doing the late shift). So I tried to get to the gym early to maybe run into him, but I reallyreallyreally need my quiet time after work and I missed him.  Back to the mountain:  I went to the sauna after my workout and who shows up but Bruno, the insane Italian.  We actually have a friendly, pleasant conversation:  heâs trying to sell his condo in the Bronx but itâs only residential, not for business and the guy backed out and maybe heâll sell the one in Manhattan too but the girl whoâs living there canât afford it and sheâs trying to get him to agree to this harebrained scheme and suddenly heâs talking so fast and his accent is so heavy he might as well be back in Torino hanging with his paesans; and then GilbertâBruno called him âPacoââthe touchie-feelie lifeguard who really shouldnât have such a pot belly, especially for someone whoâs only 30 and doesnât want to get married or date anyone he works with especially not the girl here who is cute but has three kids already but he canât understand why some of the young guys he knows would want to go out with an older woman like in her 40âs [INSERT RAISED EYEBROW HERE]; we were joined by a pretty little 20-something metrosexual who offered that younger women are always playing games and older women are more mature and have been through all that crap already and can take care of themselves and are ready for a relationships [GET HIS NAME].  Iâd had enough.  As I walked towards the ladiesâ showers, Bruno said, âSo maybe Iâll call you...?â  Maybe not, thought I.

      Stephanie had 30 freebies for a show, so of course I wound up amongst a lot of familiar faces whose names I had forgotten (as I'm sure they forgot mine) 10 seconds after we were introduced three years ago.  But I made nice.  I smiled at everybody.  And when I ran into Horace (him, I've "known" for at least 10 years) in the subway afterwards, I was able to check myself when I found myself about to sit and ponder whether and how best to say, "So, whatcha been up to lately?"  Actually, I said the far cooler, "So, do you have any projects in the works?"  And, as it turns out, he soon will start rehearsal for a Broadway play called "Brooklyn" so I have to remember to go see it.

      Went to Governor's Island yesterday ( urlLink wrote a long blog about it elsewhere ). Today I went for a bike ride. Also went for a swim, but that doesn't count for anything here; why that is, I'm not sure. Jaelyn's back in town and was at Mommie's, along with Jessey, her friend Jessica, and Jessica's 3-year-old daughter Jordan. Jordan tried to be shy, but she's 3 and I sat on the floor and played until she relaxed and realized that I liked her. I should do that with men, shouldn't I? Play with them until they realize I like them?

      Yakked with Mommie and Candy (separately) while nursing an Iced Black Vanilla Coffee at WWP. Then gym  a swim. Had a message from Freddy when I walked out. I like the fact that he really doesn't seem to want to "visit" on the phone and doesn't talk any longer than I'd like him to. So we missed each other today, maybe we'll get together next week.  Went to see Blackberry's  [What?  They don't have a website yet?] staged reading at Aaron Davis Hall. I reallyreally liked it; liked the three ancient ladies sitting in front of me and hope that I'm just like them when I grow up.

      I'm over pretending to myself that the reason I haven't written anything in over a week is that I went away, went out with friends, etc. etc. etc.  And it's partly that I decided not to tell anyone about this blog and so it seemed less urgent to keep it up.   But I'm back.  Just for myself.  Went to the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights ( urlLink their site ,  urlLink my photoblog ) and a nice man named Zade asked me a lot about my camera and we talked photography for a bit.
