						   Well, everyone has told me that the "in" thing to do these days is create a blog. So here I am. Great. A blank page to fill. This kind of thing gave me nightmares in school, and I'm doing this for pleasure?  I guess I'll start by telling you a little about myself. I'm 5'-8", blonde, blue eyes, 18 years old, gorgeous figure.....oh darn. I can't lie. OKay, okay. I'm your typical overworked, underpaid, 40-year-old mother of 3, married for 20+ years to her sweetheart, who needs to lose a few pounds. Okay, more than a few. Wait a minute. Who am I kidding? I need to get in line for a stomach staple these days!   Sigh....but I still  think  of myself as that 18-year-old with the gorgeous figure. Does that count?  Okay, back to my introduction. So I'm a fat, overworked mother of 3. I spend wayyyyy too much time working and not enough time exercising or doing just about anything else. I really need to get away from this computer more!   Let me tell you about my kids. (You knew I couldn't leave them out of it for long, didn't you?). My first-born is a typical 14-year-old boy, just discoveringthe opposite sex (though he would never admit it in a million years)and into his dog, Buddy, sports and music- specifically, drums. Very, very loud drumming. In my living room. Every day. For hours. But I do have to admit all his practicing is paying off. He's in the band at school and is one of their best percussionists. Beats alot of other stuff he could be into! He also plays the drums with the adult worship band at church, so he isn't wasting all that time. Just damaging my ears-- and aggravating his sisters.   That brings me to my two girls. My oldest daughter is just going into junior high school, the age where all of a sudden my softball/ soccer/basketball- playing tomboy is discovering makeup and hairstyles and clothes and  ::gasp!::  boys. Those creatures that just a year ago would give her cooties, are now all she and her friends can talk about. Let's just hope everything just stays at "talking about them" for a few years yet....nothing makes me cringe more than the word "dating" coming out of my child's lips! She still loves her two cats, though. At least that hasn't changed.   My youngest daughter is still in elementary school, and very proud of the fact that she is now a "big" girl at 8 years old.She's just a lovable creature, the one that still lets me hug her and hold her in my lap, the oneforever in a good mood. Her best friend at the moment is a big, fat, cute guinea pig named Raffi (named after Raphael Palmero, the baseball player). Yes, everyone in my family is a sports fanatic, including the baby. And yes, she too plays softball.   Last, but certainly not least, there's my hubby. The man I married 20+ years ago, who hasn't changed a bit on the inside, but well, let's just say we've both changed quite a bit from our wedding photos. He's probably the best husband a woman could ever have- understanding, gentle, loving and sexy, steady, a fantastic father, wonderful provider, wise spiritual head of the family. He just has  o-o-o-n-n-e-e  itty bitty fault that drives me insane. He cannot, for the life of him, make a decision. Doesn't matter what kind of decision it is- unimportant, like what-to-wear-today, or life-changing, like should-I-take-this-job. I've always been the one to ultimately make all the decisions in our family. And that's okay. Most of the time. I just wish, once in a while, he'd decide to do something wild and unexpected...like whisk me away on a second honeymoon ;-) But hey, what woman wouldn't wish that, right?
