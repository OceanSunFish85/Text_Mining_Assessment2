           Kagabi, um-attend ako ng meeting for our Youth Concert. It will happen sometime in November. Naglakad lang ako papunta and pauwi. After the meeting, I took the same route - southgreen. Eh, after sa guardhouse, may nakita akong aso, seriously sniffing the flower. So, tinitingnan ko sya. Eh, medyo nagulat kaya, hayun! Ako ang nagpagdiskitahan. Tinahulan ako at may balak pa atang habulin ako. Pero, syempre, naglakad lang ang lola mo. Feeling ko, napahiya yung dog kasi nagulat sya ng walang katuturan kaya ako ang napagdiskitahan. Sayang at cute pa mandin sya!

          ANG BUHAY SINGLE  Bakit ba tuwing may "get2geder" ang mga tao,mapa-family reunion man orsimpleng barkada gimik,ang unang tanong sayo ay,"May boyfriend ka ba?",at bago ka pa maka-sagot ay maririnig mo naman ang, "Bakett walaaaaaa??!",Hayyy, kelangan ba talagang may bitbit kang boylet samga occasions na ito?Pano kung wala talaga?Alanganamang maki-usap pa ako sa mga "close" guy friends ko para mag-panggap na "kami"?!i naman ata tama yun, dee-bah? How I wish na sana mas maintindihan ng mga taona sa mga panahon ngayon ay"accepted" na sa society na MEDYO made-delay ang pag-iisang dibdib ng mga kababaihan..especially girls like mewho want to get into so many things all at the same time.I also wish that people would understand thatOKAY LANG AKOand the rest ofTHE SAMAHANG MALAMIG ANG PASKO...Valentines day..Birthday..etc.I mean, we do get lonely once in a while... naiingit din dun sa may mga LOVELIFE...paminsan-minsan? kung minsan naman ay nagmumuni sa mga past kilig moments? but these lonely moments do not and will not make our "world" stop...Isipin nyo nalang, na kung wala kaming mga singlefriends nyo,eh di wala kayong paghihingaan ng sama ng loobtuwing nag-aaway kayo ng boylet or girlet nyo?wala rin kayong "instant date" kung sakaling nangailangan kayo?... wala rin kayong mahihila sa mall para maghanap ng magandang regalofor your better-half pag xmas...o kaya pag bday nya?at ang pinaka-mahalaga sa lahat,wala kayong KAKAMPIif things between you and your labidabsdon't work out. Marami naman sa aming mga singles ay nakaranas na rin na "ma-in-love".. yun nga lang, obvious ba?????????? it all didn't work out! Pero di naman kami "bitter" o galit sa mundo? and totoo nga nyan, eh, mas lumalalim ang kahulugan ng"love" para sa min. When you're all by yourself,there's more time to reflectand think what you really want it life.Mas naiisip mo kung ano ba talagaang makakapagbigay ng tunay na ligaya sayo... at mas naiisip mo kung pano matutupad ang lahat ng mga pangarap mo.And while reflecting,we also get to imagine that we will,one day.... end up with someone who will share those dreams with us.Di naman sa nang-iinggit ako pero masaya rin ang buhay naming mga single...Biruin mo we can go out with anybody, anytime..that is. We can get into all kinds of things.. like go to the gym regularly.. or get into all kinds of sports...or any "Self-enhancement" programs, etc...Mejo tipid din ang buhay single kasi la naman kaming po-problemahin tuwingValentines day or Christmas? o diba ang saya? Sa palagay ko naman ay lahat tayo aymay karapatang sumaya ke single man o attached ka. I guess may kanya-kanya lang tayongpanahong lumigaya at Diyos lamang ang makapagsasabi...kung kelan nga dadatingand oras na yon.So, para sa mga kasalukuyang "ATTACHED",I wish you all the love and happiness.Should there be any problems, don't forget that your SINGLE friends are always here for you!!!!! Sa mga "bagong SINGLES" naman, wag nang magmukmok! Enjoy life.... enjoy the single life!!!There are a lot of things that you will still discover.At tandaan mo,DI KA NAG-IISA!!! madami-dami tayo..hehehehe :) At dun naman sa kapwa kong mga SINGLES?I hope that we are one in believingthat we long for someoneNOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE HAPPYbut we long forsomeone becausewe want to share our happiness with that special person for the rest of our lives....

           this is one of the stories that made me cry. read on...   "UNLESS I AM SURE..."My husband is an engineer by profession. I love him for his steady nature, and I love the warm feeling when I lean against his broad shoulders.Three years of courtship and now, two years into marriage, I would have to admit that I am getting tired of it. The reasons of me loving him before has now transformed into the cause of my restlessness. I am a sentimental woman and extremely sensitive when it comes to a relationship and my feelings. I yearn for romantic moments, like a little girl yearning for candy. My husband is my complete opposite, his lack of sensitivity, and the inability of bringing romantic moments into our marriage has disheartened me about love.  One day, I finally decided to tell him my decision, and I wanted a divorce.  "Why?" he asked, shocked.  "I am tired, there are no reasons for everything in the whole world!" I answered. He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thought. My feeling of disappointment only increased. Here was a man who can't even express his predicament, what else can I hope from him?  And finally he asked me "What can I do to change your mind?" Somebody said it right, it's hard to change a person's personality, and I guess I have started losing faith in him.  Looking deep into his eyes I slowly answered "Here is the question: 'If you can answer and convince my heart, I will change my mind. Let's say, I want a flower located on the face of a mountain cliff, and we both are sure picking the flower will cause your death, will you do it for me?'" He said, "I will give you your answer tomorrow." My hope just sank by listening to his response.  I woke up the next morning to find him gone, and saw a piece of paper with his scratchy handwriting, underneath a milk glass, on the dining table near the front door that [reads]:  My Dear,I would not pick that flower for you, but please allow me to explain the reasons further. The first line was already breaking my heart. I continued reading.  "When you use the computer you always mess up the software programs, and you cry in front of the screen, I have to save my fingers to that I can help to restore the programs.  "You always leave the house keys behind, thus I have to save my legs to rush home to open the door for you.  "You always have the cramps whenever your "good friend" approaches every month, I have to save my palms so that I can calm the cramps in your tummy.  "You like to stay indoors, and I worry that you will be infected by infantile autism. I have to save my mouth to tell you jokes and stories to cure your boredom.  "You always stare at the computer, and that will do nothing good for your eyes, I have to save my eyes so that when we grow old, I can help clip your nails, and help remove those annoying white hairs. So I can also hold your hand while strolling down the beach, as you enjoy the sunshine and the beautiful sand and tell you the color of flowers, just like the color of the glow on your young face.  "Thus, my dear, unless I am sure that there is someone who loves you more than I do I could not pick that flower yet and die."  My tears fell on the letter, and blurred the ink of his handwriting. And as I continue on reading:  "Now, that you have finished reading my answer, if you are satisfied, please open the front door for I am standing outside bringing your favorite bread and fresh milk."  I rush to pull open the door, and saw his anxious face, clutching tightly with his hands, the milk bottle and loaf of bread. Now I am very sure that no one will ever love me as much as he does, and I have decided to leave the flower alone.  * FROM: Leahlyn A.
