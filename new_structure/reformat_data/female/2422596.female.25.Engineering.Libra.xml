      Tilsat 25 ml Melafix igen. Jeg synes det hjÃ¦lper, me jeg synes ogsÃ¥ det er ret meget, jeg har brugt halvdelen af dÃ¥sen. Og der ligger en lille film af noget olie-agtigt pÃ¥ toppen af vandet, det er ogsÃ¥ lidt olieagtigt (Melafix'et altsÃ¥). SÃ¥ nu vil jeg ikke tilsÃ¦tte mere, tror jeg, bare lade det vÃ¦re til pÃ¥ sÃ¸ndag hvor jeg skifter vand.  Gorm  (agazzisi) jager de to scalarer (som jeg har dÃ¸bt Valdemar Sejr og Valdemar Atterdal) rundt. Det virker som om han har taget de ene ende af akvariet som sit revir, og han jager dem skÃ¥nelseslÃ¸st. Han er e agressiv lille fisk.  Den ene scalare havde nu trevlet rygfinne, men ikke halefinne. Det er som om det trevler og hele meget hurtigt, mÃ¥ske trevler det fordi de bliver jaget.  De skal nu nok sÃ¦tte ham pÃ¥ plads nÃ¥r de vokser.   Fodret idag med Gala, senere med tÃ¸rrede daphnier og grÃ¸ntpille.   Temperatur: 26.2

      Jeg har igen tilsat 25 ml Melafix. Det sÃ¥ ud til at revnen i scalerens finne er vÃ¦k, tilgengÃ¦ld var der en ny i halefinnen. De manglende skÃ¦l mangler stadig.  Men fiskene opfÃ¸rer sig ikke syge, de kommer frem og vil have mad mv.   Jeg fodrede med frostfoder, de rÃ¸de myggelaver (? eller en anden orm?), vil senere give lidt JBL Gala og en grÃ¸ntsagspille.   Jeg forsÃ¸ger at holde temperaturen pÃ¥ 26 grader, selvom den muligvis godt kunne vÃ¦re hÃ¸jere?  Jeg forsÃ¸ger at holde min pH pÃ¥ neutral eller lige under, men det er lang tid siden jeg har testet.   Temperatur idag: 25.9

      Idag opdagede jeg at den ene scalare havde ligsom et sÃ¥r eller nogen afreve skÃ¦l, eller muligvis en hvid belÃ¦gning pÃ¥ den ene side. Der var ogsÃ¥ en revne i dens finne. Jeg tror ikke det er en belÃ¦gning, det ligner mest den mangler nogen skÃ¦l.   Jeg tÃ¦nkte jeg ville prÃ¸ve det Melafix Christian tog med hjem fra USA til mig, dosen er 5 ml/ 40 L, jeg har ca. 200 L vand i akvariet, sÃ¥ jeg puttede 25 ml i. Det skal jeg sÃ¥ gentage i 7 dage, men det kan vÃ¦re at jeg stopper efter pÃ¥ sÃ¸ndag nÃ¥r jeg skal skifte vand. Nu mÃ¥ jeg se hvad der sker. Det lugtede sjovt, af Eucalyptus...  Men alle siger det er godt, sÃ¥ jeg hÃ¥ber det hjÃ¦lper. De pÃ¥stod pÃ¥ indlÃ¦gssedlen at det ikke skadede hverken filter eller planter, sÃ¥ det hÃ¥ber jeg.

      SÃ¥ har jeg lavet en blog for mit akvarium. Mest for mig selv, da jeg burde have styr pÃ¥ hvad der foregÃ¥r: jeg fÃ¥r ikke lige skrevet det net i en bog, det er nemmere at have det elektronisk, og det er smartere med en Blog.   Beskrivelse af akvariummet:  250 L akvastabil med sort skab til.  Eheim pumpe med varmelegme (finder nr. senere...) Nye rÃ¸r fra Sera installeret for en uge siden.   20 RÃ¸d neon 7 dvÃ¦rg- nannostomus 1 gul ancistrus (Olfert) 1 han apistogamma Agazzisi (Gorm) 2 scalarer (Valdemar Sejr og Valdemar Atterdag)   Masser af planter, ikke sÃ¥ mange alger.

      Skiftede 30 liter vand ud, 40 L ind. HÃ¦dte 4 x 1 hÃ¦ttefuld Aquacid i, nok til 120L . HÃ¥ber ikke fiskene fÃ¥r pH shock.   Har kÃ¸bt nyt JBL Nitrit ssÃ¦t, men ligesom pH sÃ¦tet, kan det nogen gange vÃ¦re svÃ¦rt at se forskel pÃ¥ farverne.   har ogsÃ¥ kÃ¸bt granulat foder, det tror jeg er bedre for Scalarerne.   MÃ¥lt kl 18: ph: 7,0-7,4 (det er svÃ¦rt at aflÃ¦se) NO2: 0-0,025

      Jeg vil prÃ¸ve at komme tilbage til at bruge denne...  Fiskene har det fint. Jeg er meget doven med akvariet, det vil jeg prÃ¸ve at lave om, men vandet er ikke blevet skiftet i lang tid.   Jeg prÃ¸vede lige at mÃ¥le pÃ¥ vandet. pHen er hÃ¸j, over eller pÃ¥ 7,6, svÃ¦rt at sige nÃ¥r testen kun gÃ¥et dertil. Det virkede som om der ikke var noget Nitrit i, men sÃ¦ttet er gammelt, sÃ¥ jeg stoler ikke pÃ¥ det, vil nok kÃ¸be et nyt imorgen.

      I forgÃ¥rs: tilsatte det sidste Melafix, 20 ml. HÃ¥ber det er nok. Jeg kan ikke rigtig se om der er nogen forbedring endnu.  fodrer ikke idag.

      IgÃ¥r kÃ¸bte jeg nogen JBL pleco chips til Olfert, da jeg var lÃ¸bet tÃ¸r.  Efter min oprydning sÃ¥ mangler jeg mÃ¥ske nogen planter, men de havde ikke rigtig sÃ¥ stort udvalg i  urlLink www.akvarieudstyr.dk , sÃ¥ jeg kÃ¸bte ikke nogen. Jeg skal ogsÃ¥ snart i  urlLink Zoocity  og kÃ¸be kattemad/grus, de har altid et stort plante udvalg.  Jeg tilsatte 25 ml Melafix igen. Der er virkelig ikke meget tilbage, jeg hÃ¥ber Christian skal til USA igen snart :).   Idag snakkede vi med elektrikeren omkring vores badevÃ¦relse. Han skal jo slukke for strÃ¸mmen nÃ¥r han skal til og lave el, sÃ¥ jeg venter nok til den dag med at ordne filter + slanger. SÃ¥ skal jeg jo alligevel have startet pumpen og alting igen.

      PÃ¥ tide jeg benytter denne her igen?  IgÃ¥r fik jeg endeligt lavet et vandskift efter meget, meget lang tid. Jeg fik fjernet en masse planter, valesnerian var ved at overtage akvariet. Der var ogsÃ¥ mange alger, grÃ¸nne lange og slimede. De lÃ¥ hen over overfladen ogsÃ¥.   Det var virkelig pÃ¥ tide. Jeg vil prÃ¸ve at skifte vand hver uge nu, det tror jeg der er behov for. jeg kunne ogsÃ¥ godt tÃ¦nke mig snart at rense filter og slanger.   Ud over det, sÃ¥ har den ene scalare lidt finnerÃ¥d i halen, det ser ud til at blive vÃ¦rre. Jeg prÃ¸ver derfor med Melafix, har tilsat 25 ml idag. Jeg hÃ¥ber jeg har nok, der er ikke sÃ¥ meget tilbage i flasken.   Jeg har ikke mÃ¥lt nogen vandvÃ¦rdier.

      skiftede vand idag; 40 L. Brugte det sidste aquacid, sÃ¥ nu mÃ¥ jeg snart se at fÃ¥ noget nyt.   Jeg har renset pumpens outlet, flere af hullerne var stoppet til. jeg har ogsÃ¥ vendt dyserne udad, af to grunde: For det fÃ¸rste for at skabe mindre turbulens ved svÃ¦rdplanterne, det kan vÃ¦re at de sÃ¥ gror? For det andet for at skabe mere turbulens i overfladen. Vandet har vÃ¦ret dÃ¦kket af et tyndt lag af de grÃ¸nne slimalger, de er desvÃ¦rre ikke helt vÃ¦k. Der sad ogsÃ¥ nogen pÃ¥ planterne. jeg hÃ¥ber lidt mere turbulens kan bryde dem fra hinanden.   Jeg rensede noget af bunden, jeg tror det er super godt at gÃ¸re, da det lugtede!  Scalarens hale, jeg synes ikke det bliver bedre, og heller ikke dÃ¥rligere. Eftersom der ikke er andre steder den har flossede finner, eller nogen af de andre der har, sÃ¥ kan det vÃ¦re det er noget andet? Jeg ville ihvertfald Ã¸nske jeg havde mere Melafix.

      skiftede ikke vand igÃ¥r, da jeg vil gÃ¸re det hver 14. dag. Og sÃ¥ bliver det melafix jeg havde ogsÃ¥ lidt lÃ¦ngere i vandet.  Jeg tror scalarens finne ser lidt bedre ud.

      ahh well, just came back from riding. I rode Mecur, and he was sooo stubborn, grr. But we were only three, and we tried a jump. I was ot very good at it... sigh. But I did get him over one that was 20 cm tall.... hmm...   Otherwise, I cant wait till we travel to Thailand. It is so damn cold today. If it is so cold, at least there could be snow...

      So, today I ran 4 km. I'm so good!!  Since Sunday I have actually been back running, and it is nice.  Yesterday I went Christmas shopping, and somehow, no matter how nice it is, it is still hell. Well, at least I got some presents. Now we just need something for Christians mom, and maybe something for my brother and his girlfriend.  I also brought a new mascara. I brought a doublethingy with a primer and  colour. (I brought the Revlon one, witch is 40 dkr cheaper than the L'Oreal one they have been advertising for on TV. I did buy it because I was intrigued by the ad, so I did buy one, just not the brad advertised for. I would probably give a marketing people a headache). So I tried it out, of cause, and made a comparative study to a old mascara. And the strange thing it that it actually worked! It did give my longer lashes... I most say I never really believed it would work, but it did. You learn something new every day.

      Ran 3 km this morning, much nicer when the weather is pretty. The sun was shining, and the air had just a hint of frost and winter.  I really wonder when the first snow will come. Normally we do have a little in November, but this year we have had no snow at all.   I have finally been able to make a wish list, came up with a bunch of things. Most of them pretty expensive, but thats the way I am....  I am considering dying my hair either bright red or purple. Just becase I'm bored. Well if I should dye it, it should probably be some copper-blonde, at least I know that will suit me. The other stuff will probably look horrible, but well its temporary... I am considering it. But not before January, so I won't look horrible in familiy Christmas pictures forever. Or something....

      So today I have been out running, wheee. Well, not that far, but I tried to get the tempo up. My lungs weren't happy.   Today I have not only seen  urlLink this  crazy thing (as Susan noted now all we need is gadget to attach to the horse so we don't have to learn how to ride...). No furthermore, I have seen (part of) a Hindi Bollywood romantic drama from the beginning of the 80's (I assume) on  urlLink mbc  with Arabic subtexts. My life is complete!!

      [Sorry this will be in Danish]  sÃ¥, igÃ¥r var jeg til ridning, og heldigvis havde jeg bil, da Christian blev tidligt fÃ¦rdig.  Vi var kun 4, hvilket jo altid er rart, og jeg red Marlow. Det var meget fint, ud over at jeg havde sindsygt ondt i ryggen sÃ¥ jeg spÃ¦ndte i lÃ¦nden. SÃ¥ jeg fik ikke galopperet eller redet nedsidning. Marlow er en giraf. Hans hals er helt vildt lang. Men han gÃ¥r dejligt friskt fremad, det var super.   Nu mÃ¥ jeg videre med det der jeg skal til eksamen i...

      So, now I have added the links of some pages that I go to often. Had to put something there...  Well what should I wish for Christmas??   A lot of people want my wish-list, and I have no idea. Except I would like a horse. But no-one will give me a horse. And I don't have money for having one right now, but never mind.   I wouldn't mind a new computer either, but mom wanted something she could buy me, not just to give me money.. arghh!   Well wish list making on my to-do list...

      We went and saw Lost in Translation in  urlLink Grand , and it was good. It was a bit anticlimactic, and a bit too long, maybe, but it was also funny, subtle and generally an interesting and good movie.  It definitely made us want to go to Japan!  Afterwards we went into a small cafe opposite, it was interesting, it was in an apartment more or less, you were sitting on the first floor, in a small room, so it felt like being in someone's living room. They made really great pancakes with ice, and an OK organic hot chocolate, that unfortunately suffered form what I thin most organic cacao drinks do, they cacao taste is somewhat lessened. But really a great place to go after a movie, it was not extremely expensive either.

      Jubiiii!! I got my new keyboard and mouse yesterday. And I love it! It is a Microsoft Wireless Desktop Elite (I now have a l33t keyboard!!), and it has all sort of cool features, like volume control, a left hand scroll wheel, and other special keys that can all be reconfigured. And even though I couldn't get the split key natural keyboard as I was used to, it is still very, very nice to use, it has a great feel.  the mouse is very nice too, and the wheel can tilt so you can scroll sideways. Very nice!  And it looks good too.  Yep, I'm very happy :).

      Had a really nice riding lesson today. Rode Mekur, and while we didn't do anything extraordinary, I didn't have to fight with him. Some of the horses I just don't commuicate with, like Martini, but I can ride Mekur. Eventhough he is very, very tall when you havn't been riding in 3 weeks...  Anyway. Sometimes it is very nice to have a car. Sometimes it is a pain. Like when the car can't start after you just driven it into the gas station and filled gas on. Then you call the car-help, and they put power on the car, because apparently the battery is flat. Ok, the car is now running, and you can drive it home. Keep it running for 30 min, says the mechanic guy. Ok, 35 min later I park the car, and then I try to turn it on again. Nothing. I can't even get the central locks working... so now I'm thinking maybe the battery recharging doesn't work.   So we need to get it to our mechanic shop. Where we have a appoitmet on Thursday already, becuase the steering wheeel is jumping, eversince they fitted a new wheel, since Christian slid into a sign when it was slippery... sigh. yeah its great to have a car. Well, at least I can point and say the public transportation keeps getting more and more expensive...

      Ahh a new day at the office. And new Linux trouble, but I'll fix that soon.   Yesterday I went with Christian to  urlLink NKK 's boulder competition. I was going to say hello to Jonas, and then go with Susan to a nice a cafe and chat a bit. It was very nice, except that Jonas and also Susan were still a bit ill :(. But nice to say talk and such, since we have been away.  Afterwards, Peter convinced me that we should go out and have 'just one beer'. Christian needed no convincing... We went to Cafe Viking, and it was really nice, but of course they had more than one beer. I tasted a nice Wheat beer, but otherwise I drank sodas, since I was driving.  Well, around 20.30 the pub closed, so we were going home. Except the others were going to Cafe Castro to get something to eat... So we went with them. In the end we were home around 23... So I didn't get to study as much as I liked to.   But it was very nice, I learned something about Peters Ph.D. in biochemistry, which is about some critters that you cant tell from prokaryote (sp?) (bacteria) in a microscope, but their DNA and chemistry is different, can't remember what they are called though. Well, at least he made it sound a bit interesting, despite it being single celled critters....  I also talked to Mette, who besides climbing also horseback rides and dives. I tried talking her into starting on our Tuesday team. Well, she might not have time/money, but hopefully she will come by and see how  urlLink Mattsson  is.   So now I better start today's work, and get something read about the X-window system!

      Well, not too bad (China takes up a lot of space ;), but I need to go to Africa and South America. And Australia/Oceania. And Eastern Europe...       urlLink Make your own map!   Otherwise, today I tried to cook some Thai food at home, and it went reasonably well, I just want a gas stove...   Still a bit tired and jetlagged, but not much. Will probably go play AC2, instead of trying to study.  But I did get something done at DTU today, I got my internet on Linux, and I got a webcam installed. Go me!

But right now I'm at DTU, trying to get started with our project, but I'm waiting for Kristine, to know what she has found out. And I cannot connect to the internet with my Linux, but I'm going to set it up now, and see if I can get it to behave in a way I like.  I also went and checked the course in Network Security I'm taking, it looks good, but I need to get the book.

      Yesterday, I went riding as usual. Mekur had been out on a trip in the forest, so he was in high spirits... At first it was nice, because I could use his energy productively, and I got him rounded well. But he was also kinda angry at the other horses, a bit annoying, and in the last part of the lesson I simply couldn't control him good enough. To do that you have to keep him forward all the time, and it can be a bit hard. You really also have to have nerves of steel and not panic when he gets into attack mode, and just ride him.  Didn't work 100%, but I'm sure a lot better than I was 3 months ago, and that's the important part. (right? - please!)  We went and saw two films at the night film festival yesterday too:  Killer Clans  Yet another Shaw Brothers movie. The best so far I think. It was about warring clans, Mafia like, I think. Then of cause had killers, and everyone was trying to get everyone else.  The good guys and the bad guys got intermixed, lots of plots twists, sneaky aha's and old men that never can be taken down! Oh, and romance too, and the theme seemed to be that you really cannot buy love or true loyalty. Lots of funny and great fighting too.   Golden Chicken  This one was a more contemporary Hong Kong movie. It was about a Hong Kong hooker, and we get to know her life story, starting in the 70's with golden times and lots of money, moving through time and crisises (how the hell do I plural crisis?), involving lovestories, divine intervention and such. A very funny, very well written and plotted movie, and very sweet too.

      Well,   urlLink Susan  went competing at our rding club this weekend. And she won one dressage class, and got 3rd place in another on Saturday, so that was great. She jumped on James Sunday, except James didn't jump, he walked... hmmm...  Well; I was helping out both Saturday and Sunday it was very nice.  And now I have promised a lot of people that I am going to enter the next competition in May... Oh no! Well, I should be able to, and I don't aim for winning, just being there without panicking totally (which probably will be a good thing if I'm taking Mekur, since he can get hot tempered...). Oh, and dressage only, of cause!!

      [Backdated] Saw two more movies this evening, both from the Shaw Brothers:   Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan  This was a movie about  a young girl that gets abducted to a brothel. A luxury one, but nevertheless. She fights it, then gives in to the owner, another woman, who is in love with her. Well, they can fight of cause. A lot of jumping, fluttering skirts in fighting women, betrayal, revenge and killing by plunging your hand into people.  Both women had some fantastic half-smile, chuckle, humppf, when someone underestimated them... Very funny I thought. Oh and naked breasts!! Well, the movie was quite old, from the 70's I guess... Oh, and I can definitely see where movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (or was it the other way around?) and Kill Bill gets their inspiration from. And probably countless of Hong Kong movies that came after.   The 36th Chamber of Shaolin   Another fighting movie, this one was more straight (in both senses of the word.. ta-da ok, bad joke). About a young man that wants to learn Shaolin Kung-fu to fight the invaders. The Shaolin monks don't meddle in worldly affairs, but he becomes monk, and later goes back to defeat the bad guys. He also succeeds in making the Shaolin teach Kung-fu to the common man.  A lot about his training, a little bit too much fight, fight, fight to my taste, could have used a romance, or plot twist. But very pure, definitely a genre definer.   Great to see those old films, can see why they had great influence. Going to see another one on Tuesday.

      [backdated] Saw two films this day:    Baytong  An excellent Thai movie. It is a bout a monk, whose sister dies in a train terrorist bombing. He then have to leave his secluded frost monastery and take care of his 5-8 years old niece. This leads to him becoming acquainted with both disco and hit dancing, bicycling, love, Islam and loss. Both funny and serious, with comments to the religious conflict in Southern Thailand. Especially good when you have been in Thailand, of cause.    The Last Days of the Universe (Universets Sidste Dage)  Another film taking place in Thailand, but about a Japanese guy. We thought it was an action movie with a dash of comedy, but it was really a more quiet subtle movie. Don't know witch genre I would place it in. It was really good actually, when I think back at it, but initially a bit disappointing since we expected something else.  And we were too tired to watch that type of movie.  It will come up later in cinemas here, and if you would like some quiet weirdness, go see it.

      Ok, it has been a while... So:   My riding:  I have had 2 wonderful lessons the last week. I really fell I have some progress, I can get Mekur to trot with some energy now. Yeah! Also, I have finally gathered courage to canter on him, and it is OK. Last Tuesday I had some trouble doing it on the right hand (volte?),  and I still loose my outside stirrup somatic, but at least I dare to do it now :). Also, I really feel I have to pull him around in canter, he does not have the energy I feel he has in the trot. But I can practice that. Tomorrow I have a single lesson with Mai, and I look really forward to that.  Tonight is the annual meeting (general forsamling) in my riding club ( urlLink Mattsson ), and I am planning to try to get a position on the board. I think that the riding school riders should be more involved in the club, and this is my way of doing that.  Now I hope they want me.   My new computer:  Is really, really great. Asherons Call 2 looks so much better now. And I really love that game, it still has hours of fun for me. And a really great bunch of people I play with, my ally The Awakening.  Even tough one of the really nice guys quit :(.  Otherwise, I have now tired Star Wars Galaxies, and while it is really nice to play with my old Diablo 2 buddy Steve again, I don't find the game that entertaining. I'm giving it a try still, though.    Our thesis:  Still working at code for motion detection, but on pause as I am trying to write some theory right now. And to fiddle with Latex... But everything still looks good, I think we have a high probability of getting something to work.    Otherwise:  The World Championships in figure skating is this week, so I watch a lot of TV. Eventhough my favorite icedances have gone pro :( No more  urlLink Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat , or the Russian couple. Good riddance to the Italian one they always competed with, though!   Also, the  urlLink Night Film Festival  starts this Friday, so there will be lost of movies to watch.

      Today, I went up early, and ran 1 km. Yesterday I rode. OUCH!  It has annoyed me that I have not gotten around to running sicne, well, Christmas, but since it now is light in the morning, I decided to start again. But I'm so tired now. And ouch!

      So, today I went riding this morning. Mekur as usual, and it went really well. I think I could get much more energy into him than usual, yay! Also, I got some really nice feedback form Sarah (our instructor), and I think I figured out how to get him rounded a bit nicer. A bit. Well, I'm getting better all the time!  Otherwise, I have been looking at thread in C, and interesting things like cleaning up after threads that ends and such. I miss Java.   This evening I was to Golden Z Club meeting, it is a youth club under Zonta ( urlLink zonta.org ,  urlLink zonta.dk ). Zonta is a organization for women in leading or independent positions in business, and works to advance the status of women. The youth club is for university students or just graduates, that aspire to be leaders one day. I don't know about the leadership part, but who knows. I like the part of supporting women, especially women in business, and I think there is a lot to be done in that area. We are building the club to be a professional network, and also we have a 'normal' Zonta club, Zonta Roskilde as sponsors, and we are going to have a mentor agreement with them, that will be really interesting.   Today we had our annual meeting, where we discuss bylaws and such, but this was some very interesting discussions, as the club only started in November. We have a lot to figure out what and how to do.   Also, there are some really nice people, only one that annoyed me a bit, but she did have some good points that I agreed with . Just not the presentation...  Next Friday we will have a party to celebrate the foundation of the club, that will be great.

      Wheew, that was a long thing to do.... I am quite sure, btw that if we kept passing it back and forth, we could easily find 100 things we have in common.   Otherwise, today I progressed on my C programming for our thesis. Got two programs to communicate using named pipes. Not that difficult, actually, you just have to figure out how it works, and wrap your mind around the antiquity that is C. Really I don't like that backward language. First of all I'm too used to thinking object oriented, and even with a very simple 15 line program, you can feel that C is not thought that way.  And then I am also used to Java, where everything might not be efficeint, but the way things are done are more aestethically pleasing (you don't use a file open function to open a byte stream, for instance).  And worring about memory allocation and freeing also seems so old fashioned...  Oh, well, but it can get the things done, and has a library to communicate with an X-window server, which is why we use the language.

      So, this is a meme thing from the  urlLink livejournal  community, but I got it off  urlLink Susan's blog .     Instructions:  1. Copy this whole list into your journal.  2. Bold the things that you have in common with me. If you don't know how to make something bold, I dunno, put asterisks around it or something.  3. Whatever you don't bold, replace with things about you. Take note, ALL 100 are about me, the bold ones I have in common with Susan, where I got the list. You bold what you have in common with me then make up new things about YOU for the rest. You can make the non-bold things somehow related to the things I had in that place,which is what I did, or just make something up, as you prefer.    Well, I don't have a comment system, but if I know you you can tell me you did it. And I don't really know anyone besides Susan who read this and would do it, anyways... I have added my own comments to the list items, also to those I have removed, in parentheses.    01. I tend to be too neglectant of my aquarium. (was: I tend to drink too little during the day.  Well, I do remeber to drink. Didn't know what to put, but I really should take better care of it, even tough it looks good)   02. I love to sit quietly and enjoy the nature    03. I like to read    04. I am happy with the important things in life - less so with the less important ones that still have pretty big impact  (finances for one)   05. I love Mexican food.  (and Thai food, and Italian, and classic French, and... I love good food!)   06. My mother and I have had more ups than downs.    07.There are some things I would possibly go back and change, but if I did, my whole life would be different. I'm not sure if I want that.  (This one is a bit wierd? I would, but I wouldn't... send that application to McGill University!)   08. I wear glasses well, contacts mostly    09. I love to cook, but I am not as fond of cleaning.  (Or you could say hate...)   10. I like cats.    11. I like dogs.    12. I am married. I'll eccho Maria's and Susan's sentiment on this one: (Yay :-) )    13. I've never been to Bermuda.   14. My favorite colour is green. Or purple.  (was: My favorite colour is burgundy)   15. Hopefully I will finish university - eventually  (actually hopefully very soon)   16.

I want to travel (most of) the world.   20. I like to get up early, if I need to get things done.  (Was: I am definitely a type-B personality (get up late, go to bed late).

I have been an assistant teacher on my university.  (Was: I have yet to have a study related job at least as far as my current studies are concerned. I've worked as a translator, which is actually really relevant to my ex-major (English).  I have also done statistics and systems analysis, actually)   25. My biggest vice is laziness.  (Me, lazy? noooo, you can't mean that!)   26. I consider myself very analytical.   27. I enjoy playing an instrument or singing, but I don't consider myself talented in that respect.  (Was: I'm gifted musically)   28. I wish I was better integrated into my family (beyond parents/siblings)  (Hey! I sent christmas card to my cousins this year. Well, half of my cousins anyways....)  29. If I am in doubt about whether or not I can get a job done, I rather not start.  (Was: I'm a perfectionist in things that are important to me (riding f.ex.). Well, I'm not a perfectionist as such, I just dont like a half finished job)   30.

I can't sleep without a pillow - even if it sucks    32. I love baby animals. Like who's going to say, "Damn, kittens suck!???"     33. I have no use for pretentious people.   34. I believe the future will be a great place to live. (I really do. I have faith in mankind, and maybe a bit naively so, but I think technology and evolution (of the society and mind) will bring us a brilliant future.  Was: I think I'd rather live in the past than in the future. Oh no, not as a women. And who really wants to die from an infected wound??)   35. I believe in the Oxford English Dictionary.

My parents have been married for 25 years.  (Actually more, but I guess that counts as well?)   40. I hate people who insist on doing things the hard way, even after I've politely explained the easy way    41. I really enjoy thoughtful gifts, even if they cost nothing.    42. I love to make people laugh and smile. (who doesn't? 'I am the evil super villain, and I love to make people cry'?)   43. I cannot imagine living without a pet   44. I can imagine living apart from my husband for any amount of time ( - but that doesn't mean I will like it. I can imagine we will need to, due to career issues at some point.  Was: I cannot imagine living apart from my husband for any amount of time)   45. Patience is something I need to work on, but I'm trying. at least I try sometimes   46.

I possess an above-average I.Q.    54. I have a tendencyto be late for appointments.   (Was: I procrastinate. isn't this on on the list twice?, but it  is  on the list twice, so I added something I'm fairly certain I have in common with Susan...)   55. I always wear earrings.  (almost)   56. I've never been snakebitten. again I'll eccho Maria: but then, few people in Denmark have.  (No, but you have lived in California...)   57.

I prefer hot or cold weather to in-betweens  (actually I prefer any kind of extreme weather. Stormy and thunder to windy and showers...)  69. I have never been to Roskilde Festival.

I have never tried a candlelight bath, but it sounds wonderful.    73. I cannot survive without internet access.   74. I have become quite good to say no to responsibilities I in reality don't want. (Years of expereince in volunteer organisations paying off.  Was: I haven't yet learned to say no, but I'm trying.)  75. I am good at presenting my opinions in a discussion (see above...  Was: When confronted, I'll debate and argue, but I get all trembly. I do much better at this sort of thing via email than in person.)   76. I love snuggling with my husband. Both when it does and when it doesn't lead to more.    77. I own one pair of scratched sunglasses. actually several - and maybe a pair that isn't scratched up too bad  (do I have an unscrached pair??)   78. My bra and panties almost never match.     79.

(Was: My weight is pretty stable no matter how I eat, exercise etc.)   82. My boobs are natural.    83.

The only thing I know I am allergic to is nickel.  (Was: I'm allergic to cats)  85. I hate flying. The only good thing about it is that it takes 10 hours to get somewhere it would take a month to get to by train or car.  (Was: I love to fly. it's take-off and landing that gets me. Still true about the landing and takeoff though. It took a week for right ear to become normal after we came home from Thailand)    86. I daydream sometimes.    87. Sometimes I talk to myself - or more specifically, I imagine conversations and say my parts out loud. sometimes I say the other party's part out loud, too  (I also make huge monolouges about an interesting topic sometimes...)   88.

I am not very good at keeping anything up for appearences sake. (Not always a good thing; to yell at someone in the middle of the street...  Was: Noisy eating really annoys me. It only annnoys me if it is very bad, but then my husband says I have terrible table manners...)   91. I am easily amused. on occassion very easily    92. I'm ready for this list thing to be over.    93. It bothers me that some news stories get huge amounts of coverage, when the same thing gets totally ignored under different circumstances.    94.

      So, Saturday we got back from Tisvilde.  The apartment was sort of dusty in the kitchen and hallway, but behind the taped doors it was OK. It is really weird to have all the stuff we usually have in the kitchen standing in the living room.  The bathroom was bare.  Really bare concrete, the floor broken up down to the iron supporting things (lÃ¦gter) that needs to be protected.  Looks so strange. I must remember to take a picture.  They had also removed the toilet, so now we have no bath, no toilet. Luckily there is a toilet in the backyard, but still... They also put up a shower in the cellar.  We decided to keep the cats confined to my room and the living room, as there was holes in the floor in the bathroom, down to the cellar below.   Monday I stayed home to talk to the bricklayer guy, and he was really nice, and we talked about how we wanted the bathroom.   Tuesday, we should get new (512K yeah!) internet, part of Christians work benefit. So free internet, very nice. But of cause the router didn't work correctly, so I don't have internet. Grrrr. After being away from my internet a week, and now this...  I really wanted to catch for our weekly new-char session in AC2 on Wednesday, but now it seems like I will miss it today as well. Grrr. Really.   Oh well, we also went and saw Kill Bill vol. 2 last night, and it was really good. A lot more backstory is revealed, and it is much more interesting than vol. 1. But still as cool.   Other than that, e-mailed with  urlLink Marshal  , who now have a blog up and running on his site.  We are going to his and his wife Eri's wedding celebration in September, and I'm looking forward to seeing him again, has been 4 years since we saw him. Since our wedding :).

      As a quick note, I ran in Tisvilde, both yesterday and Wednesday. Wednesday I got lost... sigh. Also, who put hills in the forest?  Susan sent me some of the pictures of me that Jonas took the other Friday, when we had a lesson. He took it with our camera, but I didn't get around to look at them before we went away. So Susan sent me some, where I don't look too terrible. but I really need to lean back and straighten up...   Here is one where we look happy:  urlLink Me and Mekur   And here you can see Mekur is big horse with nice long legs. And the trot isn't too sloppy:  urlLink Another one   (yes very fast, I didn't reduce them for the internet, but I do not want to figure out how gimp works... and I'm picking up Jakob and Sofie at Lyngby station in 18 minutes...)

      Ok, so why does it make me feel ridiculously important that I have to punch in a code when I enter my DTU building in the evening?   Hm, I did a couple of Memes in Susan's  urlLink blog , and I didn't post them here. Since I'm lazy, and I don't have hidden links stuff either.

      Ahh, well, I am so good! Hehe. I started running again, I ran yesterday and today. Only 1 km, but still. Go me!!  I had a riding lesson Fridam together with Susan, and that wa a good way to do it. Joans took a lotof pictures of us riding, very interesting. Also I'm starting to get a little nervous about my promise to enter the club competition in May... I'm not sure I can sit properly in trot with stirrups, and the trot/canter change is still bugging me. And I still get a little bit afraid... Eventhough its much better...  Otherwise, we will be having handymen to fix our bathroom the next 3-4 weeks. We have been cleaningeverytihng out, and did we (mostly me...) have a lot of junk in the closets. Well, not everything is torn down. They will break up the floor the fist week, so we are moving out until saturday. That means no internet at home for a whole week. ARRGGGHHH!! No AC 2, no SWG, no gaming... only I hope to install D2 on my DTU computer and play some evenings :).

      I am going to be an aunt!! I am so exited! My brother's (Bjarke) girlfriend (Sisse) is pregnant, the baby is supposed to arrive around November 2nd (which also is Christians birthday).  They told us last Wedneday when we saw them at my parents. I kinda figured it was a possiblity, as they were getting settled and all, but I didn't know it would get me so excited, but I really am. I think its wonderful.  Also, I had a perfect riding lesson Friday, Mekur was in such a good mood, it was great. I got to canter on him, and he even bucked a bit with me when I drove him forward, but I was ok with that. I even cantered after he bucked with me. I wasn't afraid really, he just did it cause I wanted him to go forward so much, and he did definetly live up.

      Watching 6.5 hours of Bollywood movies (that is 2) in a crappy theater made for 15 min educational films is NOT the best hang over cure.   (I will be back later with notes on films I have watched the last 4 days, and maybe why I'm hung over...)

      Friday Christian and I went out together for a whole day. We started by having brunch in  urlLink Fields , the new-ish shopping mall in ÃÂrestaden. We then shopped a bit there, or Christina got a lot of clothes. We didn't see it all, but itwasa very nice. Very light and airy, and nice shops. Lots of sports shops all in one place. Debenhams was smaller than expected, but they had some really cool kitchen and home stuff. Bilka One Stop was Huge!!  Afterwards we went out and ordered our new bathroom furniture at Svane. Wheeew. All decided upon, all done :).Except for a few bits of cause... Then Christian picked up his climbing T-shirts, they looked good. We also hadsomem hot cocoa at BankerÃ¥t. We went home, and went out to Tapasbaren for dinner. We were an hour early, so we went into a winebar to get something to drink. Very nice place with big comfy chairs.   Tapasbaren was very nice. The food was not exceptional, but it was different and nice to try. The best thing was that we drank sherry to the whole dinner, very interesting so different sherries can be. Christian didn't know what he wanted to do afterwards, despite me having zillions of good idea. In the end we went home and played PS2 (Well I played, Christian read).  All in all a great day!!  Yesterday we went to buy a shower [armatur], we found one that looked OK at Silvan. We also got some lights for the ceiling, so the electrician can fix everything when he comes.  We got some paint for the toilet, and I painted yesterday and today. All done :). Christian have been cleaning the kitchen, very, very nice.  I like painting better than cleaning, but even though I can reach the ceiling with my to step ladder, I'm still afraid I'll fall over..Sigh! But I think it will look really great, so nice to finally get rid of that awful colour it was when we moved in! Soon we will go to visit my parents, Bjarke and Sisse will be there as well, that will be nice!

      Today I went to a project for young Somali woman that one of my Zonta friends is a volunteer on. It is a project for Somali girls in the high school age, where they can support each other and such. I went to talk about studying for Engineering as a girl, and it was a good experience. They were really funny and sweet, and nice to contribute to something like that. And I always love to tell people; 'No Engineering is not just for boys.' :).   Otherwise, I hate our wireless network, I can't get it to work with my computer, In fact I'm on the wired net right now... grrr....

      Jonas took some pictures of Susan and I at the club competition the 15th of May. I couldn't read the CD at my home computer, but here I can. So I'll try to post some pictures of me and Mekur here. You can see some pictures of Susan at her blog (when it is up again...).  The quality is not so good, some of them were blurry since we were moving, but also I had to size reduce them in GIMP, and I am not that good with that tool. Now I uploaded the pictures to my DTU account, then I might go home and make them a bit nicer.   Here we go; first the starting halt:     Trotting:     And trotting on the circle:     I like the last one, at least I am looking where I want to go, not down on the horse or at the judges.   He is a very pretty horse, isn't he? Juliane who should also compete on him, and her older sister Leonora had fixed his hair and the bandages on the legs :).  Oh, and I love the color the leaves have in May. It was a very beautiful day, and definitely fun.

      Firstly, I have updated the Blog layout and such, since Blogger got new templates and new functionality. So far, I like it. (Comments, titles...).  Otherwise, I have installed a wireless network. Or installed the card in my computer, and updated the installation Christian made. Now it's somewhat more secure... I also got the freakiest computer error ever. At some point the internet was unavailable, and I noticed that my IP number had changed to something that was way out of range of the IP numbers our base stations assigns. Ok, I try to fix it and I succeed. I, wrongly, assumed it has something to do with the network setup... Today I got the same error, and after some investigation, I conclude that on playing the old single player game Zeus (a city building game), my IP changes. It's a single player game. It shouldn't have anything to do with my network connections at all! But it does. Bad programming somewhere, I suppose. Luckily restarting my computer fixes it.  So, since I haven't posted in so long time: The bathroom remodeling is actually moving forward, but being with only a toilet in the backyard on the 6th week is a bit annoying. The handymen (or whatever they are really called - it can't be handymen, can it?) are a bit annoying, and we need to figure a lot of things we never thought we had to think about, and it is a bit trying.  Other important stuff: My riding competition. While fun to be at and be part of, I was very, very nervous. So Mekur tricked me, of cause, because he does that... Nothing too bad, but I did finish last. I got ok marks for the stuff he behaved in, so that's great. I will definitely want to compete again, and next time maybe be a little less nervous! But the next competition is the 5th of September, and at that point we are in Canada to Marshal and Eri's wedding celebration, so I won't compete until November...

      So, today I decided it would be great to some laundry. See, because of our wonderful bathroom remodeling, this is not just the ussual throw things in the washing machine turn up and so forth. No, the water to the washing mashine is cut off, so we have to go to the laundromat. Which also explaines why we barely have any clean clothes (that we want to wear for this summery weather) left. So I packed a back, and went up there. But of cause it was closed, since someone had broken in the night before, and ravaged everything in an attempt to get money I assume. So no clothes washing today...

      Yesterday I went riding, preparing for th ecompetition next weekend. It was a GREAT lesson. Mekur had been out in a nother lesson just before mine, so he was nce and warm. He really takes some time to get warmed up. I did aome canter-trot transistions and it went ok. I also rode the programme twice, and it wasn't too bad. Ok probably horrible, I'm afraid I don't sit that perfectly on him, and my circles were too small. But I could do it, and  that was the important part. I'm am beginning to look really forward to next Saturday :).  We also were at some friends birthday party (Jakob and Sofie) in HolbÃ¦k. It was really nice, and we were very well treated with respect to food. We went home about half past 12, a longdrive to Copenhagenm but it is kind of nice to wake up in your own bed.   We are still trying to figure out what furniture and sink thingy we should have in our bathroom. I think we want basically the same stuff we had earlier, just nicer quality and looks.   Oh, and I ran 1 km this morning, and it wasn't so hard. I really need to start running on weekdays as well.

      Still raining. Have been for a couple of days. It's not funny anymore, this weather is depressing. It's not even proper, heavily downpouring rain or thunder, just grayness, some light rain, grayness, some heavier rain, grayness... Give me thunder. Or sunshine. Now!

      I have in some time considered becoming a member of  urlLink Det Radikale Venstre , the Danish Socio-Liberal Party. I agree with most of their politics, and I am interested in politics, discussing it, and being part of it; making the world a better place. I believe I can do so, or at least strive to do so. Idealistic, I am. It has been a while since I took part in University politics, but now I can more often see myself being part of city council, or maybe the parliament.   So, what promted me to send the membership application right now? Today I saw a portrait of Magaret Thatcher on television. It was very interesting, also because I was really to young to understand politics, especially foreign politics, at that time. It really inspired me. Not because I agree with Mrs. Thatcher's politics, because I'm quite sure I don't, but I admire her person. She really fought for what she believed was right, and she did it well. She kept on promoting her vision of a better Britain, and I think that is admirable.  I thought to myself, yes, I really do want to make a difference. It is not just a loose idea, it is something I really want to do. Now I will see where it takes me.

      Just had a single lesson on Mekur today, with Mai. It was wonderful! Some of it went ok, some of it not so good, but I cantered a lot, and I had surplus to concentrate on my hands and seat in the canter. Whoooohoooo! Also he was so happy, and kept going, he had a lot of energy today. So cool!!  So sad it will soon be holidays, but I reckon it will be nice for all the horses to get a break...  I want to ride tomorrow. Again and again!!!

      Went riding yesterday, as usual. The stable the school horses are stabled in is being renovated, so most of them were in temporary boxes in the yard. Mekur really loved that. He only had one neighbour, Kingston, and he had of cause more space around him. He was much happier when I saddled him, and much fresher in the arena. Very very nice. He did want to have fun, and was testing me a bit when I started, but then it went really well. I enjoy riding him more and more, and I have even considered trying to strike a deal with Gunilla (daily leader of both the stable and the riding school) and his owner if I could ride a set amount of time each week, only having instruction some of the times. But I need to finish my thesis first and figure out how to do it in the afternoon/evening, since I'm sure I'll get a job right away :).  I want to ride some more. More, please more!

      For the EU Parliament. Doing my civic duty and all.   Also, I have  finally  come up with who I wanted in the role of Helen in Troy.  urlLink Aishwarya Rai ! (Not official site, btw.) She is one of the most beautiful women in the world, I think. I know she is and looks Indian, but she is not very dark, the Greek were dark and not fair skinned. Also, in the movie we did not get to know who were her parents or her backstory, so an exotic touch might have been a possible explanation for her beauty.   Also, went roleplaying today, we got a 3rd player, nice, but Pelle unfortunately couldn't today, so we were still only two players. Went nicely though, except we could a little healing. Oh and with the ever twisting plot, I'm afraid we really screwed up...

      Yesterday we had our monthly Zonta (Golden Z Club) meeting. The topic was feedback, and Ella Schumann from Zonta Roskilde were invited to speak. She has her own consulting company,  urlLink Evolution ApS .  We had a very interesting discussion covering a lot of things, mostly how and why we perceive others as we do, but also about how we interact in social situations and the borders of what is private, personal and public about us.   The main point about the feedback, that both the giver and the receiver should be conscious about what exactly they want/give feedback on. Also when you give feedback, you can only state what you perceived, you cannot tell anything about if the other person is good at what he/she generally does. That is up to the person to decide, based on what several people perceive about them.  We also talked about Jung's shadow theory, that was very interesting: About how the feedback you receive when you are a kid determines what kind of prejudices and 'boxes' you have. It also determines what feelings and behavior you show. Other feelings might be surpressed and are hiding in the shadow. This might not be 'bad' feelings, if your parents didn't want you to laugh loudly, the inclination to do so might hide in your shadow. I would like to read some more about it, but knowing me, I will probably never get around to it :)Â·  All in all a very good meeting, it made me think about some things I don't normally think about, and that is always good.

      Friday we went and saw Troy,and we really liked it. It was actually better than I had expected, I think both Hector and Achilleus were very good, and well casted. The only problem I had was Helen, I didn't think she was beautiful enough, not that she was ugly, she was just ordinary good looking, not stunning. Also I didn't think Paris and Helen seemed like they were in love, the spark just missed. I dunno.  Oh, and I admit that Brad Pitt can look good. Yeah... Apparently they whole bronzed, oily, muscled thing works for him...  Today (or yesterday actually) Susan and a riding buddy of ours, Marianne, and I went to  urlLink Roskilde Dyreskue . We saw a lot of horses, and a lot of different races. A Shire stallion in full gallop is a sight to see! Many pretty horses! Uhmm Friesans. We also saw lots of other animals, goats, sheep, hens and other poultry, cows, rabbits, cats, dogs...  The sun was shining, it was a wonderful Danish summers day. But we had no sunscreen with us, so we all got burnt of cause. Ouch!!  We will definitely do it again next year. With sun lotion.

      [sry, in Danish. Random complaints about our bathroom adventure] I fredags kÃ¸bte vi jo et armatur til badet, sÃ¥ hÃ¥ndvÃ¦rkerne kunne sÃ¦tte det op nÃ¥r de tilsluttede vand og sÃ¥dan. Vi regnede med at de ville gÃ¸re det tirsdag (mandag var jo helligdag), det havder mureren sagt. Det var ogsÃ¥ derfor jeg fik malet toilettet i weekenden.  Idag var vi lidt langsomme, sÃ¥ vi nÃ¥ede at snakke med blikkenslageren. Jeg spurgte om han ville sÃ¦tte vores armatur op, hvortil han svarede at det var han ikke sikker pÃ¥, da de havde deres egne de plejede at sÃ¦tte op. Men det var der jo selvfÃ¸lgelig ikke nogen der havde informeret os om, ellers havde vi nok ikke gidet at finde et i Silvan!?. Suuuk! NÃ¥ sÃ¥ fortalte han videre at han godt ville sÃ¦tte vores op, men vi skulle vide at det ikke var VA godkendt, sÃ¥ der var ingen garantier for det kom til at fungere. Man mÃ¥ gerne sÃ¦lge nogen der ikke er VA godkendt, men ikke sÃ¦tte dem op. Argggh!!!  Vi sÃ¥ sÃ¥ det armatur som de ville sÃ¦lge, et Grohe 1000, og det var meget pÃ¦nt, sÃ¥ vi bad ham om at sÃ¦tte det op. Det er helt sikkert bedre kvalitet end det vi havde kÃ¸bt. Jeg ville fra starten af gerne have et   urlLink Grohe , da de sponsorerer Michael SÃ¸gaard, en af Danmarks bedste dressur ryttere. Det eneste Grohe armatur de havde i Silvan var Ã¦rke grimt, men det har var ret pÃ¦nt, sÃ¥ det er sÃ¥dan set endt meget godt. Men grrrrr, det ville have vÃ¦ret rart med lidt information!!  Det gode er at vand og toilet og vaskemaskine bliver sluttet til idag (ved mindre det gÃ¥r helt galt). Jeg kan ikke vente!! Hvad har vi haft, 6-7 uger med toilet i gÃ¥rden?? Og vi trÃ¦nger i den grad til at fÃ¥ vasket noget tÃ¸j....

      Was really bad. Mekur was in a very bad mood, I felt I had to push around. He tried to object, and he wanted to threaten the other horses. Very annoying. I have a lesson together with Susan on Friday, I hope that one will be better.

      Well, not much. Moving into the last month of our thesis, the days look pretty much like each other, writing, a bit of coding, a bit frustration, some more writing.   Except for the visit to Tisvilde to the in-laws, which was nice, my mom's birthday which was also nice. Ad Sune's (one of Christian's old philosophy mates) birthday party last Saturday, also nice. And sunny :-)!   Also, saw Susan and Jonas Monday, ate nice Thai food at the Siam Orchid, yummy. They are finally back from all their vacationing, and brought nice gifts :-). The Sprite Ice Cube does taste weird, but in a good way I think. Well, menthe works for me... Don't ask...     Well, back to writing.

      Yesterday it was finally summer. No more rain! Yay!    Christian went to the moat and sat in the sun, had icecream :D. We also had BBQ for dinner, first time this summer...    Otherwise, Kristine and I have decided to go back to handing in our Thesis at the original date, the 30th of August. We just cannot get it done by the 13th, so now our defense will be after I get back from Canada, but that is OK.

      Been a while so here I go: Last Saturday we went to Laust to have a BBQ. It was very nice, it was a long time since we had seen him. Always good to talk about computer games, computers in general, studying, beer and more. The problem is that Laust doesn't drink wine, so he had of cause brought beer for us. Since I don't drink much beer, I had brought a bottle of wine with me. I got a nice wheat beer, a bottle of wine... We also went with his neighbours to the common house (in the dorm/apartment place he lives) and got a drink. We played Trivial with his neighbours also, so we weren't home until 4 am. And I was kind of drunk. But a great evening. Oh btw I got a new bike Saturday as well, as my old one is 11 years old. It is great to use.   On Sunday Susan, Corinne (an American woman riding at Mattssons, right after us and also on Mekur) and I went to the Danish Dressage Championships, which took place at Broholm Ridecenter in Fyn. I had to pick up Susan and Corinne at Lyngby station at 9 am. So I only got 4 hours of sleep, and I were a bit tired and hung over... But the Championships were very nice, there was some really excellent riding, it was great to see. Eventhough it was raining, and the seats were hard... Next year with blanket, without hangover :). You can see some very nice pictures, as well as results in  urlLink Susan's Blog .  Wednesday Christian and I went to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. It was really good, we both found it much better than the other Harry Potter movies. Also, it was nice that I had forgotten some of the plots, so there was a bit of suspense :). Before the movie we ate at a small diner, Kazim's Kitchen close to the movie theater ( urlLink Empire ), and he made some really good sandwiches.  Thursday Christian went to France to climb, so I took him to the airport this morning. Poor me all alone. I will survive :). He really needed to get on vacation, so I hope they have nice weather down there. He is returning on Monday the week after this.  Friday my brother and Sisse got married. Bjarke phoned me last Friday, and asked if I was doing anything this Friday, because they were getting married at the city hall in Gilleleje. I was in some kind of shock, didn't expect that. But very pleasant surprise :). It was very nice and small, only the closest family (those that weren't away on holidays). After the wedding we went to Bjarke and Sisse's house to have brunch. It was a long time since I have seen their house, they had made a lot of improvements, it is going to be so nice. The brunch was great, they had made some really delicious things, like home made Nutella! We also went for a short walk to the beach, as the weather was actually quite nice yesterday :). It was nice to meet Sisse's family, and it was a wonderful quiet wedding, and I really hope it was exactly what they wanted. I think it was :).
