      When I tought you were gone, When I felt I wasnÂ´t strong, my tears went down my cheek,  and begged not to be weak.  When my eyes, were in disguise, my tears hidden under a smile, as the moon and all the stars,  were sick, just to ask them  to you be mine.  That pathetic wish I asked with so much hope, all my words, that in the wind, got lost...  In my deep soul I asked, How long will this suffering last? and that eye saw me up there, had compassion in some way, To make me diferent from who I was, and got my wings to grow real fast. Now people arent able to fly yet,  And im diferent in sop many ways. That scares me, Sometimes.... but, at least, I have my smile.

      Now in all this silence , I look back, I dont want to be with you, you people make me sad, You are pathethic, Im not like that ,  Someday you will see, that the days put us apart, Made us stronger, and now, you cant deny it, With those tricks, Now all this silence.  That death passed by and no one cared anymore, after you cried your eyes out, and you remain alone, Why you had to do it Now the pain you caused, eternally, so sick Now, You will have to pay it, And the distance that made us cry apart, I know you heard our sobbs and regrets, So maybe you will see Now, what you made you wont forget  Many times i have cried but now i realize that my wings wernt broken tha my soul wanted to die i was out of passion for the things i used to love maybe sometimes lust, and from now and everynight i would cry for all those lies so now you could realize that my soul would never die

      No more blame I am destined to keep you sane  Gotta rescue the flame  Gotta rescue the flame in your heart   No more blood, I will be there for you my love  I will stand by your side  The world has forsaken my girl   I should have seen it would be this way  I should have known from the start what she's up to  When you have loved and you've lost someone  You know what it feels like to lose   She's fading away  Away from this world  Drifting like a feather  She's not like the other girls  She lives in the clouds  And talks to the birds  Hopeless little one  She's not like the other girls I know   No more shame, she has felt too much pain, in her life  In her mind she's repeating the words  All the love you put out will retun to you   I should have seen it would be this way  I should have known from the start what she's up to  When you have loved and you've lost someone close to you  You know what it feels like to lose   She's fading away  Away from this world  Drifting like a feather  She's not like the other girls  She lives in the clouds  And talks to the birds  Hopeless little one  She's not like the other girls I know   She's fading away  Away from this world  Drifting like a feather  She's not like the other girls  She lives in the clouds  And talks to the birds  Hopeless little one  She's not like the other girls I know     (esa me describe! juju) </post></Blog>
