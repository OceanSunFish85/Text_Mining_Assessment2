      Hey there, guess what?? Your tax dollarsare being wasted away like fart in the wind. oop! there went 2 million, oh! another 4 million. Yippee!!! As i sit here crying out in glee, my conscience says in a whisper, a very low murmur.... "where did it go?" Hmm. Good Fuckin Question!! I have no fucking idea. I bet a lot of zombies dont know or dont care to know, they just want to buy the lastest TV or set another forest fire. (Local camper my ass!! Fuckin pyros) Anyway, back to my topic, NO ONE Knows! Granted I dont make much money from being a total lazy bitch but I still have to pay my taxes in April and so do you little Zombie. Well, today I saw a perfect example of what i pay for. I was visiting Rancho Santa Margarita, CA and as i am driving up the local street, I see a traffic jam.... In a residential neighborhood filled with the Fuerer, (i will talk about that later), a traffic jam! I think to myself "OH No someone must have hit a kid or something", I see the Sheriff Supervisor in his big oversized polluting Expedition pulling up and as I get closer to the tiny intersection, I couldn't believe my eyes!!! It was Disgusting, Horrifying, I almost Cried!! Asbile comes up intomy mouth at the sight I see......  9 SHERIFF'S CARS 2 MOTORCYCLE SHERIFF'S AND 1 SUPERVISOR EXPEDITION SURROUNDING........ A PULLED OVERTOYOTA TUNDRA!!!! OH FUCK!!! THE HUMANITY!!!   No dead body, no gunfight, no hostage situation, or terrorist to be seen... You may be asking yourself, "is she serious??" Yes, Yes I Am. All that heat for a truck and a white guy who probably stole clearasil from target. There you go ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are slightly surprised or maybe you arent... Either way, I pay for the fuckers to patrol a city with no crime whatsoever and when an event like this comes along it's..."Fuck Man, I need back up!! He's got Clearasil!!" 9 cars show up.... 9!!! LAPD I am sure could use the extra bodies to help patrol their city or even the Border Patrol for Fuck's Sake!! 9 CARS!! and a k-9 unit!!   Well children I hope we learned something today.... You and I are taking it in the shorts... There i have said it. I want my money back you snakes!! Build another school or have a after school program for kids, anything, but dont waste money on all this "patrol" for nothing. It's Insulting!! does the gov't think we are that stupid?? Dont answer that.. Have a Wonderful Evening Zombies!!

      "In a practice called "mountain top removal" coal mining companies, especially in West Virginia and Kentucky, blast the tops off mountains and dump the debris into valleys below, burying streams and woods."  "The White House quietly has been making fundamental regulatory and proceedual changes that could unravel decades of progress in protecting human health, wildlife, and natural places." "The White House also relaxed the requirements for getting a permit to fill or dredge wetlands, making it easier for developers to turn wetlands into malls."

      Here I am at 24     Here I am at 24, in college, and totally confused about the situation in my country. I am not some genius or a famous poet, I am just another white chick in America with lots of questions.  Why does no one really tell the truth anymore? I find myself terrified about the future. Our environment is disintegrating, our resources disappearing, our government corrupt, there are lies everywhere, all I see are selfish people, and still the days go by like a blur and I canât stop it.  Where does my future lie? I know it will be what I make of it. But what if someone takes it from me with some manufactured bomb or disease? Will it still be my fault? I donât think I should have to worry about this. I think I should have a great life in a great country with peace and rainbows everywhere. What prevents that? Myself would be the first answer but what if another entity prevented it?  As I walk through a local Wal-Mart, I look at everyone. Some are shopping for clothes and some for TVâs, they look like zombies to me. The front of the Wal-Mart building says Satisfaction Guaranteed. When I leave that store I donât walk out all happy and giddy, I walk out thinking about how I am 30 or 50 dollars poorer. So if its guaranteed, then I want my money back fuckers. Wal-Mart has everything you need and all at great low prices. The smiley face floats around the store cutting prices and everyone is so happy to be there. What the Fuck??? No one is smiling when I walk in there. I see a handicapped lady in the front âgreeting customersâ with a look of utter despair because she has to work for these Naziâs. I see kids running everywhere screaming and crying. I see men in the magazine aisle avoiding their wives like the plague. Where is the smile again? Oh yeah, on the signâs all over the store not the faces in the store. I especially like the clothing label, âFaded Gloryâ, yep they nailed that one. Since most of the products in Wal-Mart are from communist China we Americans donât make any money off of it. So I would agree our âGloryâ is fading, with every company that uses other countries to do the work. With every Nike thatâs made by some starving kid. With every product we export somewhere else. We lose a little of that glory our Four Fathers fought for.    I wish I could walk into the white house or congress and just find out the truth. The real truth. Does it even exist? Everyone seems to have their own version and so far all of them bullshit. I want to scream in outrage but I donât think anyone would give a shit. Especially my government. Oh yes, I will vote. Thatâs the way to contribute my feelings and my concerns. Vote for another lying jackass that will fuck up my country and spend all our tax money. Yep, I will do just that and I will feel so much better right? I want someone honest for once to be in the White House. Will that ever happen? Why do I think it wonât? Seems like I have such a negative attitude doesnât it? I do. But I want to know why? I donât want to have one. It doesnât make me any happier. I am certain the person that reads this will feel that I am a âvery angry young ladyâ. Well, shit, I am dammit.  Why do I have these negative feelings towards my government? I shouldnât have them. I should be proud of my government. I am glad that I am American but not happy about the idiots running my America. Yes, I said idiots. For lack of a better word I guess. I will remind the reader again that I am 24 and am not a professional novelist. So deal with it.  I consider myself very lucky. My mother raised me by herself and I have had everything I could ever want. I am a spoiled little brat. But I am very lucky, I have computer to write this crap on, I have clothes on my body, food in my stomach, a house to live in and money in my bank account for the disastrous gas prices. I know that too many do not have what I have. That is a problem that has faced our world for too long. People like Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump make lots of money, money they will probably never spend. They have money that could probably solve a lot of the poverty in many cities. What stops them from helping other people then? Shit I donât know. What stops everyone from helping each other? I think you know that answer and because you know the answer and so does everyone else that makes it all the more fucked up.                                           I am one of those people that believe that there is a simple solution to a problem. It seems that people tend to put problems on top of other problems so a solution becomes so difficult or expensive that it will take forever to fix it.  Like the environment for example. Our current administration has relaxed several laws regulating parks and forests so that industries can have an easier time fucking it up. How nice of them. I guess it has nothing to do with big corp. donating millions to the Bush/Cheney Campaign so they would give favors in return. Also, I have learned that people have to practically force our administration to add animals to the endangered species list by court order or petition. Shouldnât you want to do that, you dumbass? Re-election! Hello!! Dumbass!   How has it come to this? I just donât understand. Doesnât our government want clean air or pretty forests? Why do we have to destroy everything that was given to us? Itâs terrifying to think of what our world will be like in 100 years. Will even still be here?   I wish there was some way to stop what were doing and just do it another way. Like tomorrow all cars turned electric and the forests were left alone. The mercury in the air and in the fish disappeared. The warming of our earth stopped. I guess there is no way, not with our current activities.   I guess I just want to be able to say to the President, âHey, stop it right now. You canât do this to our planet anymore. You suck fucker!â But I will probably be trampled by 50 secret service guys and the media will say, âWacky woman attempts to yell at president.â Damn that would be funny though. Buttholes!   Is it just me or does our president look like he was dropped when he was a baby? I donât know but he sometimes has this distant spacy look like a kid with Down Syndrome. Even those kids could run the country better than this fuckhead.  Repeat after me, mmmkay. Drugs are bad, mmmkay.   How the hell did he win the election? I remember Gore winning, not him. I guess Jebby Bush gave his brother an early Christmas present. Ahhh, how nice.   Well, I guess I have complained enough about the government. Time to move on to better shit. I donât know about you but I find stupid people fascinating. I guess I sometimes feel like Steve Irwin when I see stupid people. I just canât help but stare and think to myself, âdamn, that fucker is stupid.â Or as Steve would say âLook at this bloke, heâs off the richter scale.â âDanger, danger.â       Now I just donât stand around watching people. I see the most amazing shit in places like the gym, school, or a store. Like when I used to work for a gym, I saw this lady wearing one of those sweatsuitâs that looks like foil attacked and won. Is she waiting for the mothership to come get her? Or does she actually think that it will help her lose those thunder thighs any quicker? I just felt like tapping her on the shoulder and telling her to wait outside for her ship while she helps me with my tan. Sometimes I see these guys that are old and gross with really tight leotard pants on in some neon color that screams at you. It says âHey I am one sexy bitch!â Another time, I saw a Vietnamese woman in the ladiesâ locker room, completely naked with her fat and gross ass on the sink counter, where I USED to wash my hands, with her legs spread open and the hand dryer pointed at her stank ass poon. What the hell! That has to be one of the sickest things I have ever seen and I am only 24. Needless to say from then on it was known as the Poon Dryer. I bet she still does that to this day too. Damn! Itâs like people leave their decency and manners at home and as soon as they are at the gym, itâs like âFuck it, I donât give a shit. Balls to the wall baby!!â   I could write an entire 900 page book about the gym experiences. My former co-workers would know what I mean when I talk about the bodily fluids everywhere, the unbelievable smell, and the amount of gross ass naked people I have seen would kill most men. I am not kidding. I just donât think I want to relive that crap right now. I donât think I have enough medication.       I just finished âDude, whereâs my country?â by Michael Moore. Wow, that really changed my perspective on things. I was angry before now I am just utterly agast at how this situation has gone out of control. I am in total fucking shock!!! There are some things in this book that I could not believe. The Patriot Act is something I never even bothered to understand, I thought it didnât apply to me. I learned that it does and it applies to everyone in this country too. They can search your home, interrogate you and take stuff from you in the name of terrorism. They donât need warrants anymore, I guess some guy in some office can write on a piece of paper and give agents the right to invade your privacy. What the hell?  I guess there are people right now in prisons being held without any reason and have no rights. I canât imagine what their families must feel. I would be devastated. They are just in jail for being who they are. Be it Muslim or Arabic or something like that. How fucked up can we be?? That isnât right! No wonder people hate us. We practically kill little children in foreign factories without paying them anything and work them half to death alongside their parents. We bomb innocent people. We donât even help our own people, so that means the other countries get the shaft in a big way. Is this really my America? I canât believe what I am hearing. Please read the book, it will open your eyes.   Do I still have my constitutional rights? I am just curious, because it seems they have been flushed down the crapper.  I am young and I just had the biggest eye opener of my life. Imagine all these other sleepwalkers that have no clue about whatâs really going on. They have no idea, none, they just go about their lives in la la land and focus on themselves way too much. So damn selfishly.
