      I am on call. I am soooo tired. It is 1:20am and I only have 6.5 hours left! WOO-HOO! I have been here since 8am. Weekends are 24 hour call. The weekdays are the worse as you can potentially be up for 36 hours.   I still have to write and spill my guts about what happened to my other blog. Suffice to say the boyfriend was not happy that I was talking about him to all of you. So I took the other one down. I missed writing, so I am back. But I am leaving him out of it! He is so good to me so he will not be a topic for my blogs anymore. :)  I gotta get back to work. Will write more soon! I sold the house y'all. It was quite an emotional time.

      Well, I am back! After much renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth, I decided I missed you guys too much and missed posting my random thoughts of madness.   I have made a new blog, rather than repost all the old stuff. I will have to update you new kids on my history. And later will update you old kids on where I have been.   Suffice to say it feels good to be back! I am on call tonight at the hospital, so I will post more later. Just wanted to get this first post out there.

      I am not enjoying blogging like I used to. I used to post every day or several times a day when I had the old blogsite. Then the fiance made a big stink on how I was talking to strangers about our arguments and asked me to stop. No problem, but now I feel down in the dumps and have no desire to write. I am thinking about recreating the old site, down to my little weather pixie and all. Maybe it will perk me up.  This month I am at  urlLink Akron Children's Hospital .  It is a pain to drive every month, but it is good experience.  I am in their ER.  I have seen some very sad things this month.  Today I was involved in a little 20 month old boy that was "drop kicked" across a porch.  Thankfully he was not hurt and went home tonight.  I could have just killed the guy that did it.  Nope, I take that back, I would like to torture people that abuse children.  Next month back at my own hospital in the ER.  I am tired.  I am going home.
