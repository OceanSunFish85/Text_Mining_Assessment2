      PERIOD AND PAIN!   I cried a lot again... For Shamus, for us. I miss him a lot. I love him a lot too I believe. I gave him up. I felt horrible.... The pukey feeling came again... I am so damn painful all over now... My period is killing me and my heart was pierced. Life still has to go on. I'd move on and so will you. Farewell....  Kisskiss!

      MISS ME NOT?    Hi dear friends, how nice to be able to write again! I was stressed up by my projects and best of all; I was made to do so many extra works! The group was impressed with what I came up with; a full 11 pages of Anger Management and now they want me to do Stress Management which was of course, not of my responsibility.... WTF THEY THINK I AM! CBCBCBCBCBBCBCBCBC!!! 5 people in a group and 2 did nothing as 1 is a fucking Malay girl and the other is a Chinese from China! The other 2 are my beloved Brother Liang and Sister Amelia who are busy with their Stress Management! They kinda lost their way in this project as they had been doing it constantly over the weekend but still not out with any shitâ¦ As for me, 11 pages of Anger Management in 1 day and best of all, everyone in the group sang praisesâ¦ HOW PROUD AM I! KAKAKKAKAKAKAK!!!!    Oh well, lets talk about everything a little here and there. On Thursday night last week, I went to Mount Faber with Von and Laura. It was very nice to be able to just get out and relaxed at a place that you fancy. I was happy that we could once again indulged in the beautiful atmosphere and the freshest air perhaps. Not so true though as I stayed beside the hill and the trees on the hill give the freshest air every morningâ¦ HURHUR! That night I recalled a lot of things, sweet memories and such. When I was still in Secondary 3, Von, Suelyn and me always go to the airport every now and then. Those were one of the most fun days. Always buy blueberry ice cream from Swensens and eat happily! HURHUR! After Mount Faber we went to West Coast Mc Donaldâs drive thru and bought some nuggets and fries. Yummy! On the way home, we dropped by the petrol kiosk and I bought a tub of Swensensâ Ice cream for Von and Laura. Hope they like it.    On Friday, I went to school as usual and after school, my group was supposed to stay back and plan for our projects. We booked a room in the library and discussed about how we should go about with the Anger and Stress Management thingy. Brother Liang and Sister Amelia went to another room and continue with their Stress Management leaving the rest of the group and me in the first room. I couldnât work with that stupid Malay girl, as she is too assertive and she is one who talk the most, disagree the most and yet, did nothing for the group so far. WTF! MALAYS ARE MALAYS! I give up on themâ¦. Jing Jing the Chinese girl arenât so bad as she still does her research and her part but still I decided to do the whole part MYSELF! I canât work like this, I prefer working alone as working in a group is time wasting and when our ideas donât match, there are bound to be clashes. SICK OF THESE SHITS!    We had team building to do after the project discussion and everyone are supposed to stay for dinner, somewhere some place. Jing Jing did mention she couldnât make it for dinner but would stay for a drink a day before. When the clock strike 5.30pm, Siti came into the room and said her mum need her back homeâ¦ WTF AGAIN! Always full of craps and excusesâ¦ She left with Jing Jing and I was like DUHZ. I joined Brother Liang and Sister Amelia in their room and continue reading my part on Anger Management. While doing our stuffs, we chatted a little and suggested going Geylang for Tou Huay! They were brainstorming and I gave them a lot of my ideas. Well, shocked to see that they actually did use my ideas as part of their part on Stress Management. We left at 6.30 as the Library was closing. Brother Liang agreed to get us to Geylang! So happy, we hopped on his car, a Toyota Corolla and went on the road but to our dismay, traffic was really bad and we were stuck on the road for almost 1 hr. Reached Geylang only at 7.30pm and were busy looking for a parking lot. Lucky we found a lot soon and proceed to Yong He Dou Jiang for our dinner! YUMMY AGAIN! Left Geylang at around 9pm and reached home around 9.45pm. So shagged man!    On Saturday, I woke up feel tired and sianz as I have to get started and do my project. I had breakfast and was watching TV in the living room when I suddenly had the urge to play game so I went ahead. HURHUR! I miss playing games as I basically had lesser time to do so nowâ¦ Haizâ¦ I got mad at Darling in the game because he said, âLets mateâ when he landed need me. I was furious to be exact, the word mate reminds me of him and Amy. PUI! That whore! Anyway, I was sarcastic and said, mating is for you and your exgf. Well, she did once asked him, âNo love can make love meh?â and the answer given to her make her tear like shit. Yes, man has needs! When she asked that question, I insisted that darling should answer what I had told him, âItâs not making love, its merely fucking or perhaps, having sex!â Of course he did not said that lahâ¦ KAKAKAKKAKA! AM I EVIL?    Min called me around 7pm and she was crying then. She asked if she could come over to my house now and I said okie. What else? Must be that stupid boyfriend of hersâ¦ Always break her heart in some waysâ¦ Guys are simply insensitive horny creatures! Canât he understand or at least appreciate what was being cooked for himâ¦ Still wanna be so choosy, might as well go restaurant lah. We went for movies since both of us are not really happy. Caught Mean Girls at Westmall. Nice show though, worth the weekend charges I supposed. While at the movie, darling SMS me couple of times telling me he is going drinking with his friends. I was not very happy with his decision to go drinking, as he is not a good drinker and seldom drink but why now? Well, anyway, he assured me he would be fined and will not get himself drunk or so as he is a back up driver in his gang of friends. I reached home at around 11.30pm and bathed. That night, I chatted with Shamus until I think we should talk over the phone. He called me and we started talking. I wept a little as he was saying; he said he would never stop loving meâ¦ I was very touched. I intended to wait for Darling to get home and speak with him but because I was too tired, I fell asleep without realizing.    On Sunday, I woke up did the usual stuffs and got online to play some games. Darling called me when he woke up and I was delighted because I did not get to speak with him the previous night. I played game with Darling and it was fun because it had been a long time since we can really play for so long. KAKAKAKK! Darling is lucky as he doesnât need to work as he was given his day off. Nice! Actually, I canât recall much of Sunday except that Von is not feeling well and does not wanna go out. Hurhur! Thatâs all for Sunday. Anyway, I was supposed to be doing my project but I am so lazy and decided not to go school on Monday so I could stay at home and finish up my part on Anger Management. Brother Liang and Sister Amelia have been working hard on their part man. They went out on Saturday and Sunday to do Stress Managementâ¦. POOR THINGS!    On Monday, which is yesterday, I woke up feeling lethargic and refused to go to school. Well, second week of school and I am playing stunt liao! KAKAKKAKAKAK! My fucking conduct is always D or E because of my attendance. I got counselled twice during my diploma time because I always absence myself and did not produce any MC. WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL MAN! I am a genius! Like I always believe, sleep in class and talk in class did not prevent me from scoring well. Well, so why bother going to schoolâ¦ PUI! ARROGANCE? SO BE IT! MY LIFE! KAKAKAKAKAKKAKAK!    I played game in the morning and early afternoon. Was still trying to get into the mood of working on my project man. Anyway, my fucking pc got infected with virus because I downloaded some shit the previous nightâ¦ I was panicky like hell, as my pc cannot fail me at this timeâ¦ I need to work man! I scanned a lot of times and found the sources of the virus then I deleted the virus and restart my pc immediately as I was told in the past, always restart your pc to prevent the deleted virus from infecting again. When I switched on my pc, I was damn shocked and surprised because I just couldnât get online at allâ¦ OMG!!! DID I DELETE SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS ME FROM GETTING ONLINE???? I was furious and worried at the same timeâ¦ I off and on the fucking pc again and this time round it worksâ¦ LUCKY! Since the pc is kinda down with flu, so I decided to do my work liaoâ¦ Cannot wait till it really shut me off then I wanna doâ¦    I started brainstorming and writing down points. I read and go through all the articles that we have got and also surfed for a lot of things to do with Anger. Finally I got started and was really stressed as I am somewhat lostâ¦ I took some time off and smoked a lotâ¦ I was trying hard to relieve my tension. I got back and did my very last touch up and at 11pm sharp, I am done with 11 pages. Satisfied and happy, I called Sister Amelia telling her Iâd send her my part now but she said her printer has no more ink so I sent to Brother Liang instead. Darling was on night shift and while doing my project, I keep thinking of Darling. He was always on my mind constantly and I start to believe, when you are lost, youâd think of the person you love a lot. TRUE! I waited for darling to call but fell asleep at 3am, as I was too tired le. Woke up at 5 plus and was wondering if I should give darling a call but thinking he could be resting already so I decided not to call him lah.    Today, I woke up at 9am. I called darling and he told me he was very tired because last night he went after some ah bengs who chopped another ah beng with parang! So scary! He describes the scenario to me and I was like, KAOZ! SO DANGEROUS! Hiak! Anyway, I went back to sleep and woke up at 11am. Speak with darling a little and went to prepare myself for school. I decided to put on make up today, as there was a big big mole look-alike on my chinâ¦ SIMI SAI! KAOZ! I did not use any concealor but merely power and blusher. As for the fucking mole look-alike, I apply a bit of concealor to make it look lighterâ¦ HAIZâ¦ FUCKING FAT AND UGLY! I FEEL LIKE DYING! I put on my skirt and was surprised it kinda loosen upâ¦ I think I was too stressed last night, I puked my dinner and thatâs why today my skirt so looseâ¦ I had a bit of lunch and got outta house at 12.45pm, the fucking cabby took me the long way today and when I reached school, it was 6 bucks! 2 bucks more than usual!    School was as usual, Min did not come to school today as she was having her mensesâ¦ It was so boring without her because she is the person sitting beside me everyday, entertaining me! Haizâ¦ *was watching the HAI YOU MING TIAN now and saw that guy who looked like Chrisâ¦ Haizâ¦ * My project was appreciated by the group so I was pretty happy. HeeeEeeeeeEeEe! At 2 plus, I received a SMS from darling and was shocked he is not sleeping. I called him and he sounded rather disturbed and anxious. He asked if Iâd be going out after school with a female classmate or so and demanded an honest answer. I said no as I intend to go home ma and he let out a âhahâ tone telling me he felt better after hearing my answer. I was told he dreamt something bad happened to me and he donât want me to go anywhere except home. I said okie, Iâll go straight home so donât worry and we hang up. He SMS me couple of minutes later and see below.    âdarlingâ¦ pls be extremely careful out thereâ¦ I canât live without u ok?? My tears juz rolled out when I got shocked awake by the nitemareâ¦ so pls be super careful.â    AhhHHhhHhhHhhâ¦ So sweetâ¦ He is really a darling, my dai sek! I was shocked when Joscelin asked me to go collect our books after schoolâ¦ I showed her the SMS and she said, âthen ni hui jia lohâ. I was thinking, actually go take book nothing will happen one lah so I did went after school. Jos said how zhun can it be man, itâs only a dream but I told her, âyou are wrong man, I woke up last night at 5 plus without knowing why and when darling told me he went after those parang bengs at 5 plus tooâ¦â See what I mean? When two people are in love, you get extremely sensitive about their well-being and all. Even sleeping can wake up and I must say that this is not the first time man.    Got home feeling wonderful. Today seems like a fine day for me except that those cabbies I met today all trying to take me the long wayâ¦ SIMI SAI! Haizâ¦ I miss Von and Veiliâ¦ I miss Velong and all their names started with V! KAKAKAKKAKAKK! Thatâs all for today manâ¦ Having backaches nowâ¦ Tall people get backaches easily okie. I wanna include Chris pic for u guys to see. Hurhur!     urlLink    Chris~   Kisskiss!

      WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!        My inner child is ten years old!      The adult world is pretty irrelevant to me. Whether I'm off on my bicycle (or pony) exploring, lost in a good book, or giggling with my best friend, I live in a world apart, one full of adventure and wonder and other stuff adults don't understand.     urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      GOOD MORNING!    Morning dear all... I'm typing with one eye as the other has yet to open... Just woke up and feeling really lethargic... Damn! School is a terror I must say. After knowing I had 7 projects on Monday, I thought it was bad enough and guess what, that's not the end. Now I have 11 on hand. :) YES! FUCKING 11 PROJECTS TO BE DONE IN WITHIN THE THIRD TO THE TENTH WEEK!! CBCBCBCBBCBCBCB! I can't contain my sorrow anymore... Those fucking subjects can kill me man... Worse still, the teachers said, "It's higher diploma level, no more spoon feeding and you gotta do it the tough way." Kaoz, tough way so be it, the most I flunk all and waste 7k of school fees! PUI!    Oh dear, I think it's time to go shower and brush my teeth now... So sad... I can't write as much as I wanted to now but I hope you guys will continue writing. I read Yvonnes' blog before I wrote this entry. Hee! Lets all GAMBATE! Seeya guys!  Kisskiss!

      TO HELL WITH ME!    Woke up feeling super tired! I slept for only 1 fucking hour man... CBCBCBCBCB! Darling gave me morning calls... One after another as I kept begging for 5 mins pls! Damn! Finally I woke up and rush into the bathroom for a shower immediately to keep myself awake. Haiz!! The cab will come in about half an hour time and I was busy looking for my scarf and my things I needed to bring to school... Always so fucking last minute! Was busy searching when Min called and said she needs some bread. She was having gastric pain! Hiak! So early in the morning man... There was no more bread so I got her some biscuit instead. Hee! BOH HEE HEH MA HOR!    I got out of house as soon as I received a call from Min and waited at the fucking bus stop for almost 10 mins and moreover, under the sun! Got so fed up and called Min, "Where the fuck are you now? KAOZ! I have been waiting for the fucking past 10 mins okie!" She then said there was a traffic jam and they are reaching soon lah... TMDZ! I decided to walk down slowly, taking my own sweet time after today! PUI! Reached school at around 9.10am and went for a puff at the smoking yellow box! Yes, the yellow box that I always crack some stupid joke about it! Shall tell you guys some other time...    Had a hard time trying to locate our class and when we finally settle down, the class was like "DUH"! Those people look so kiddo and like so stupid, strange enough, Joscelin actually think they look smart... HURHUR! Time will tell I supposed... We were introduced to our course tutor and also a welcome reception... LAME!! Got to our classroom for the next subject, "MACRO ECONOMICS"! SUPER HIGH MAN! Miss Nancy Kong again... Used to sleep in her lessons man when I did MICRO ECONOMIC and STATISTIC. Oh, and yes, I flunked STATISTIC badly, couldn't even be bothered to finish my exam papers. :) She break down our project to us and I went out to pick a number representing the topic I'll be doing with Min... Today is the KNNH THE SUPER SUAY... I picked one of the most difficult topics... Haiz!! Went for an early lunch but I have no appetite... I miss my darling badly and also, too tired to even eat a single shit... I had some YONG TAU HU but gave a lot of things to Jos.    Miss Ann Ang? I have always heard of her but never did I once see her in school throughout my on and off 4 yrs of studies... She was supposed to be a very stern person as many TO are afraid of her... She came into the class and looked at the clock on top of the wall and said, "Okie, class will start at 2.30pm". She then proceed to the chair and sat down reading some stuffs... Weird, it's only 5 mins from 2.30... SO FUCKING CALCULATIVE!!!! Anyway, she appeared totally different from my expectation... She looked like Andrew Lim in Under One Roof! KAKAKAKKAKAKAKKA! I laughed my head off while telling my friends. She gave us all a mission, which is to draw something that you thing symbolised you and pass it to the front. As usual, I am always the fastest in doing anything~ **GRIN**    I drew a TV. Weird, I wanted to draw a tree or perhaps a lamppost but I changed my mind since we are to describe why we draw what and what, so and so... The first guy who was picked to introduce himself left a very deep impression. He sketched a dragon and it was made of just some lines but I managed to see it as a dragon. He then came out to describe why he drew a dragon... Impressive speech and power speaking. Jos thinks he is the cutest guy in our class. HAHA! Nice face but too short for me liao... Anyway, I have darling liao! Don't be so greedy! When it was my turn to describe, I stood up and face the class then I said, "Hi class, I think I am a TV because I can be switched on or off as and when you like. From me, you can extract any information you wish to know just by tuning the channels and also, I can be of any personality you like me to as I am versatile." Hurhur! Power man, those people look at me with a WTF look... I am too intelligent for them! Some can't even describe themselves at all. LALALLALALA!    Anyway, was rather disappointed that I wasn't able to get into Min and company's group for our project as I had picked the last 3 numbers to choose a group! SUAY LIKE I'VE SAID! FUCKING SUAY! Still, everything happened for a good cause like I've always said too! The system of choosing a group is fucked man... Like what Miss Andrew Lim said, "It's all luck sometimes and you can't deny the fact that luck is an important factor in our lives." Of course, I am not stupid... Well, guess what, I got into the group same as the "Dragon" guy! Wow! We are so gonna be the best of the best project mates... The rest of the team includes a cranky Malay girl, a plain looking Chinese girl and a Chinese from China who is very fluent in her spoken English. Nice~    OMG OMG! Sucked to eternity! First day of school only and we were given 7 projects all together! WTF? Macro Econs took 1 project and for this Behavioural Workshop, 6 projects which includes 2 individual assignment and 4 group work... All to be down within the next few weeks... Sob! I am so shagged and sleepy and tired but still have to bear with all these shits... HAIZ!!! Anyway, it was fun having the group discussion... My team really proves to be one of the best I guess... We are organised and also, very efficient in a way. We exchanged numbers and email and also, got to know that the "Dragon" guy drives and where everyone stay. We are even prepared to burn our SUNDAYS as there are really too many things to work on... SAD! Poor Yvonne and Lunatic Fly are so gonna miss me! HURHUR!!!    I took a cab home immediately after we were dismissed from class. Was too tired and all I wanted to, was to speak with my darling... He must had miss me like crazy too because he tried to get to me in vain for a few times... I went shower as soon as I am home and turn on my pc straight after... Darling was excited to see me online... He made a poem for me while waiting for me patiently at home. It was his first off day and tomorrow, he'll be off too.... Poor baby.... See below for what he had wrote okie and try to see the first word from every sentences... He is so sweet okie! I love him so much! Hurhur!     Just a smile would melt my sadness,  Extracting from within my happiness.  Sweetness and beauty made a perfect blend,  Sinking in the serenity of paradise lands.  Isolating the black and the white,  Cascading the letters on the extreme left,  And you will know the angel of my heart.     I was talking with him on the phone and felt a sudden weight falling on my head... Very heavy and very sleepy... I was trying very hard not to fall asleep as Min reminded me I will sleep and wake up in the middle of the night again! YES! I HATE THAT! Well... in order to keep myself awake, I asked darling to read to me those SMS that I sent him in the past. Hee! I wanna HUI WEI a bit! KKAKAKAKAKKAKA! I think he read about 6 or 7 of them and I dozed off loh. He didn't wanna put down and was hearing me snore till my hp rang at 8.30, waking me up... ADOI!!! I woke up and told darling, I wanna put down the phone and sleep... I cannot tahan anymore... He said okie and we put down the phone and I fell asleep like a pig all the way till 11.45pm. I woke up and was like "DUH"... How sia like that, sure cannot sleep till late late one... I called darling and he picked up after a couple of rings unlike the usual him, always picking up so fast, probably within 1 ring! Poor darling was trying to sleep first as he thought I would wake up later around 2 or 3 am and he could spend the time with me... SOB! How sweet!! Darling is so nice to me! BOOOoOooOooO HOOooOOooOoo!    KK, I think that's all for today folks. Once again, Jess gotta research on some things needed for my projects. Miss ya guys!! MUACK!    Kisskiss!

      PLEASE LET ME SLACK FOREVER!    Hi blog and hi guys, today seems to be a day full of mixed feelings.... I did not sleep well last night as I was suffering from LAO SAI!! WTF HAPPENED TO ME MAN!!! I lao sai the whole morning and afternoon, I think at least 7 times.... FUCK! Anyway, I took a small nap around 3pm and moi darling heard me snore over the phone! KAKAKAKKAKAKA! Never mind lah, it's a matter of time so take this opportunity as a lesson to the first night together! AKKAKAKAKAKKAKK!    I woke up at 5pm in a daze and insisted that Mum should send me to Saltyflys' house which was so near... She was going to the hospital with Dad to see moi ah gong... Ah gong was fine last night at the Chalet but now in the hospital... This really proves what it meant by, you'll never know what's gonna happen next! So people, live the fucking life like there is no tomorrow or you're seriously gonna regret BIG TIME!! Mum was in a hurry and refused to send me over. She simply threw 5 bucks in front of me and said, âGo take a cab lah." Wah lau, this kinda mother also got.... CBCBCBCBCB! I have been a loyal customer to the local cab services since 17 ok. If I am not wrong, my contribution is definitely more than 5k! What a splurging I must admit!    I got outta the house at 5.15pm and called Saltyfly, telling her I am on my way to her house but she wanted to meet me in Westmall instead... Haiz... Poor me with no confidence, and super low morale still gotta appear make-upless in front of so many people... We met up approximately 15 mins later and went to the Supermarket to get the necessary ingredients for the LAKSA FEAST at her house! Bought a lot of HUM!! YUMMY!! I bought some BAK GUA PIES from the PAO DIAN stall next door. NICE! We took a cab back to her house (as usual, Princess C don't take buses nor MRT). While we were walking towards the taxi stand, someone called for us and we were both shocked to see the butterfly catcher from NHSS, Miss TONG YIN! I was being very fake ar... KAKAKKAKAKKA! I said,"Wah, pretty liao man!" It's all bullshit... Don't believe me when I said that because, I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BITCH AROUND! Erm... okie lah, must lose some weight first!    As I stepped into Saltys' house, I saw a lot of food on the table and was feeling a little full man... So many things how to eat sia... Those foods were complimentary from the neighbour as there was a wedding feast held earlier at the void deck. Oh yes, void deck! Went into her room and as usual, always so DIRTY! Dang... Got used to it anyway... KAKKAKAKAKKAKAK! I bought a packet of cigarette man... Was preparing myself for tomorrow! Sure a lot of time to smoke in school. YA! SCHOOL STARTS FOR ME AGAIN AND GUESS WHAT, I HATE SCHOOL! I HATE THE IDEA OF STUDYING AGAIN! PLS LET ME SLACK FOREVER! Sad... I felt dejected and super sianz... Haiz... The vicious cycle begins again and will go on for the next 6 mths... Lucky, it's just 6 mths! PUI!    I was smoking and checking some things out from the site call fridae. Well, shown Salty some pictures of Shamus and also moi darling and she thinks darling look like a Malay and Shamus look so beng! Anyway, went back to check my blog as I wanted to click on the link directing to Shamus' blog. I wasn't thinking of anything special but it shocked me when I saw his new entry... He wrote something around 6pm and he did mention me.... See below!     Jessica: Been reading and thinking. I dont know why you still come here to read? Cant deny the fact I still think of you many times everyday. The feeling is not lost; I'm just terriberly disasterific disappointed. If you wanna be with me, Look up for me. Ya about Snow White, She's someone new, very new. But she's not like what I call her, neither elegant or gorgeous, neither sweet or gentle. The opposite and the type no guys will like. haha Dont get too jealous about it. Or perhaps you should try to stay faithful to your boyfriend.     Well... I have decided to just leave him alone for the time being... Anyway, he does not have my new hp nos ar... I did not wanna give him or should I say... He is one of the reasons why I gave up my nos for 6 years... Anyway, I started downloading Windows Critical Updates for Salty as I think she seriously need to do some upgrades man! The thing started downloading and the estimated time given was 2hrs... Dang again... It was already 8pm so she cooked me a nice big bowl of Laksa and brought it in front of me and then said in Mandarin,"5 bucks!" Kaoz... So ex for a bowl of laksa... KAKKAKAKKA! But of course, she's kidding... I ate on and she went out to watch tv... Darling called when I was halfway through the delicious laksa and I stopped to speak with him. He had began his work of the day, night shift and he is on proactive 2, meaning he gotta drive around in the police car and wait for some stupid messages for him to attend to. I was rather full already, as I had pinched on some rendang earlier but still chose to finish everything... The downloads continue....    Yvonne and Laura was supposed to be there as well but seems like Uncle Mok is still not back yet... Salty was bugging me and telling me she needs STARBUCKS! Haiz... Siao Char Bor... She wanted very much to go out and look at those people. Weird? I'll rather stay home then to go out and look at ugly people... Soon as the download was over, Yvonne reached as well but without Laura as Laura has some assignment to complete. Sianz... No Laura, moi evil twin sister! KKAKAKKAKAKA! RETRIBUTIONS! Yvonne was hungry like mad already and Salty asked if we could hit Holland Village after her dinner. She wanted so so much to drink Latte... KI SIAO! I was trying to do a virus scan for the dumb pc but seems like it doesn't work at all so we decided to leave!    Darling SMS me at that very moment when we stepped outta Saltys' house, the message read, âHoney, come to Jurong area for car spin if you can later so we can see if we are fated to meet!" So cheeky... Since we were going to the expressway, we are bound to hit Jurong and I was thinking... Scarly so heng, really can see his patrol car! KAKKAKAKAKKAKA! No leh, he was at Teban at the moment and I was seconds away from Teban when I knew he was there. Hurhur! MEI YOU YUAN FEN LOH! Reached Holland and went to get drinks at StarBucks! The Malay girl who served me looked so weird... Something is just not right somewhere! Hiak!! I got myself a TAZO ICE TEA with RASPBERRY SYRUP. Used to drink that a lot when I was working in Conrad. Hee! Kinda reminds me the good old times... Oh, and also, APRICOT PEAR from Rocky Masters was one of my favourite too... TOO BAD! Supposed to be on my way home after Holland V but I decided to go back Saltys' house for another round of laksa!    We reached her place and she started cooking... YUMMY!! Hurhur! Can eat HUM again! So happy! We were watching TV and also checking out stuffs in fridae... Finally it was time to go le as it's already 12.40am liao. Got a super shocked when Yvonne saw a summon on her windscreen.... Haiz... 50 bucks and we split the cost.... I asked her to send me to a nearby ATM machine and took 25 bucks out for her... I told her, so long as you think it as, âEverything happens for a good cause!" and we'll not feel the pinch! She got me home and I was thinking if it's safe for her man... Kinda worried for her, as she might be too mad to drive... Took my shower immediately as I was too warm and tired to think...    When I was done, I called darling to let him know that I am home and bathed liao. Hee! We make a bet on the winner for the Euro Cup and he chose Portugal so I took Greece loh. I told Yvonne earlier that Greece will win the game! HURHUR! For the past few hours, I was checking mails as well as looking out for my Primary School friends in Friendster! HIAK! Shhhhhhhh... I lied to darling that I don't have a friendster account lah! Found a few people who looked familiar man! Left them some messages and then continue to checked my email till I felt like writing blog (poor Salty couldn't write her blog today because of what I had done to her pc earlier on!) Darling was still so busy as the stupid Lao Ban and Eddie purposely want him to do some foot patrol... Poor darling was already so dead tired, me too! I am left with 2 hours or sleep!! KAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAK! By the way, Greece won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAH! OLEH OLEH OLEH! SLEEP NOW!   Kisskiss!

      PAIN!    Speaking of Contradictory, I faced a big one now. I fell in love with two guys at a time. One is Shamus, a guy who is three years younger and the other is Edwin, my darling. It is such a long story but I must say, without Shamus, Iâll never get to know Edwin. Shamus loves me the way every girl would want a man to. He is always so proactive towards me. He can always make me laugh when I am dead mad. When I am with him, he makes me feels like I am a princessâ¦    Today, I went into PT again as I was thinking I might be able to see him there. I typed out the command to pm him but was disappointed that he was not online. Anyway, to my horror, my priestess was carrying some shit items and not what was originally mine. WTF happened manâ¦ Only Shamus and Bul have my passwords to my characters and at that time, I can only think that itâs Shamus who took them away. Well, I could be wrong but it doesnât matter now. I was rather furious and decided to strip my priestess clean. A lot of super "gian benâ people was around me trying to get all those precious items I dropped.    I dropped every single thing on my priestess except for some red pots. Couldnât bear to drop themâ¦ They were in a shape of a heart and beside the heart there is a U. It was made by Shamus months back when I was still active in the game. I logged off my priestess and logged in my archer. I canât recall if there were missing items on my archer, as it was not my main character. Well, I went to the circular place where I hide from Shamus before. That time, I was just teasing him; I told him that if he could find me in that map within the next 3 mins, Iâd marry himâ¦ Well, strange enough, he found meâ¦. Shamus always tells me things he SEE. For example, he could see my house from his vision. He could describe everything he saw and again, I must admit he does have this weird ability to SEE. He always got them rightâ¦ He told me that weâd be together one day, somehow. He told me he saw himself going movie with a fat girl; meâ¦. Well, he once mentioned, he would never give me up as it takes more than a miracle to find âThe Oneâ. :â) Itâs all sweet memories now.    I cried a lot as I think of him. He was really nice to me but itâs just too bad that he is 3 years younger than me. âAge does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.â True? I dare not take this risk. Though you are rich and you love me lots but hey, you had never seen me before and youâll always be a young boy in my heartâ¦ Another reason why I cried like mad was because he said he loves me so much yet he now feel for someone so fast so soonâ¦ Haizâ¦ Love? Go read his blog if anyone is interested;  urlLink http://www.youyongku.blogspot.com  Btw, I wrote him an email and this is what I had written. I seriously hope that darling will never come read my blog again orâ¦     I downloaded PT again. I wanted to see if you were around but you aren't. I stripped my priestess since my items had been changed. I left the pots you made into a heart and a U untouched. I was rather disappointed that you were not online. I went to the place that you found me and recalled and rejoice many things about us. I cried for us, for our love that was once so pure but it's gone now. I felt lost and cold. I hope whatever is happening to us now will bring us to a good ending.    Love I felt for you, are still ever so strong, I am surprised myself. Love, be it now or then, it has never decrease. Love was never easy for us. Love came at the wrong time for us I believe. Love should come only years later I relent. Love was sweet and painful for both of us I think. Love improves a person and I hope you felt that. Love did make me a better person and I would treasure all that youâve taught me. Love for you would stay in my heart till the day I die, this I promise you.    You seem happier now that you fell in love with Snow White. You must eat more and sleep more since you are happy now. You have to be a responsible working adult and donât always give people headaches. You must stop smoking for goodness sake. You take good care of Dad, Mum and Justin, as you are eldest in the family. You will be serving the nation soon so please take good care of yourself. You had read till the last three sentences now. You must be wondering why every paragraph seems weird. You read again and youâll realize there are nine I Love You altogether and yes; I do love you till this very day.     Ya lah I know, I super damn contradicting to the extremes but you also can't deny the fact that a guy like this will not capture your heart... Haiz... Whatever lah... By the way, there is this thing which is pissing me to the infinite liao! I was using Microsoft Word to type and all of a sudden there is a sign that appears behind everyword that I am typing... Worst of all, I couldn't seems to get rid of it no matter what icon I clicked on... WTF!! Pissing me off in the middle of the night and moreover, I am already so fucking tired like hell! TMDZ!!! Can someone who knows what I am talking about, give me a call can tell me a solution please! I will buy you prata I promise!    Okie, guess it's time to get back to my daily event report. I woke up today feeling a little excited as it's Angels' birthday party later in the evening. Well, I went out of my room and saw a big tray of sotong balls freshly fried to be brought to the chalet. Hee! As usual, I pinched and pinched, steal and steal the balls into my mouth and slowly chew them down my throat. My mum went passed me minutes later and was commenting about the balls,"Weird, how come 90 over balls looked so little to me...". Guess whats my reply! KAKAKKAKAKAK!! I said,"Hannoh, why so little sia, I had only eaten 8 or 9 ma..." My mum looked at me and said,"8 or 9 only huh!!!!" KAKAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAK!! BUAY TAHAN!!! Hiak! We reached the East Coast Coasta Sand Chalet around 1pm. 2 words to summarised what had greeted me at that place, SUPER SUCKS! That place was so dirty and the rooms were all run down and there were some repairs to be done for some fixtures and the toilet bowl water tank was not working and the weather was killing me!!!! DAMN IT!    Anyway, the party was supposed to be a fun one but because of some stupid malay spg bimbos that were invited, I kinda lost appetite man! WTF!! All those bitches dressed as if they are working in Geylang and behaved like they are some super whores! What a disgraced to the family... All thanks to the little sister of mine... Haiz... When will she ever learn? Anyway, all I can say is, in the mind of those ang mohs, all they care for is a good fuck and anyone who can offer them a good fuck, is just another fucking whore to them. :) Please don't go around catching viruses or diseases and end up screwing with one another. Ah, the food was good though. Especially the chickens and the cake. Hee!! YUMMY!! Wow, 6am already, me and my another CHIONG HEI BLOG! Goodnite to all moi friends. I kinda miss my darling now. He is such a sweet little baby...   Kisskiss!

      SWAN LAKE OR LEG?    I burst out laughing when I read Sugarflysâ blog last nightâ¦ She addressed me as Swan Lakeâ¦ A real funny reason behind this name but it was more than 10 years agoâ¦ KAKAKAKKAKAKA!! Well, nice to know that she can remember little details for so many yearsâ¦ HEH! Today was a restless dayâ¦ I wanted very much to get outta the house and strange enough, I had 3 groups of friends dating me today; Sugarfly called at 1pm asking me if I wanna go IMM with her and Yvonne today, Min called at 1.30pm asking if I wanna go do manicure today and QP called to wanna meet me for dinner at Jurong Point todayâ¦ So happy and honored people still remember me at timesâ¦.    Last night I made a major decision that would affect my life in a way. I changed my hp nos. Weirdâ¦ All these years, I had opportunities to do this but I did notâ¦ Now? I think I am very determined with my decision nowâ¦ I think I had met the right guy for me already and itâs time for me to put the past behind me and start afresh. These are probably reasons why I decided to change my nos, a nos since I had my very first hp. Anyway, the new nos is meant for family and friends only. Xian Zha Ren Deng, I am so sorry, you are not short-listed.    Supposed to meet up with Sugarfly and Yvonne at IMM at noon but I couldnât make it so I asked if theyâll be going elsewhere after IMM. They had no place in mind and Yvonne wanted to go home to look at Coco the precious little bitch so I called QP instead but seems like she is meeting up with someone else already as I did not give her an answer. Fine, Jess shall stay at home lahâ¦ Anyway, tomorrow is my little bitchy sistersâ 21st birthday party. I believe Iâll die of exhaustion entertaining those people attending. Most importantly, I do not wanna hang out late also because today is 2nd July and when the clock strike 12 tonightâ¦ Itâs our 2nd month anniversary!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAKK! YA LAH! ONLY 2 MONTHS BUT ALREADY SO IN LOVE! SIMI SAI!    When I read Sugarflysâ blog, I came to a conclusion that itâs true everyone is contradictory. We always claim that we can do it like this and this but when itâs time for you to prove it, we canât. Itâs not easy trying to please everyone around you. Like me, I am a person who doesnât seem to be able to reject people. Always try to make everyone happy and in the end, I am the unhappiest! I guess itâs true that when you tried too hard, things backfire and donât turn out the way you want them to be. So please, leave life as it is, as I always believe, everything happened for a good cause. You might think you had missed the bus to work but who knows, the bus might end up in an accident that took lives on board. So long as you are happy and you did nothing wrong, so be it and as for the rest of the people around you? FUCK THEM! FUCK THEM ETERNALLY AS ITâS FREAKING NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS HOW YOU WANNA LEAD YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE! Remember, you earn you own living and you donât have to an answer to anybody except those who raised you... **Contradictory spotted**   Kisskiss!

      MMS IS FUN?    Dear blog, good morning. Howâs your day so far? I can only say I am fucking tired now! I went to town with a mission but got too excited when I thought of sending moi darling an MMS. KAAKAKAK! Met up with Veron and partner as well as Min at Takashimayaâ¦ I got a free ride from mum since she was heading town too but she let me off at Scotts because she was only going thereâ¦ I walked all the way to Taka and was already quite tired liao. They were waiting for me at a secluded area off the side of the department store on the first floor. HEE! They did rebonding today and so I expected their hair to look BIAN! Super bian! AKAKAKAKKAKAK!!    We proceed to Watsons to get some gel that Min wanted to get since long agoâ¦ Shall wait for results to be shown. Blab! I did not intend to have dinner cause I had lunch at 2pm and was still full but Veron and partner were hungry already so we decided to cross over to Paragon and eat jiao zi!!! Moi favourite but too bad, Veron donât like to eat jiao zi! We then decided to eat Spaghetti instead. I ordered a meatball spaghetti and shared a chicken Caesar salad with Min. The meatballs were good but I had no appetite due to the exploding excitement building up in me as I had already decided to send a MMS I took using Veronsâ new mobile phone. When they were still munching away, I was taking shots!!! I took a few and kinda gave up because I looked so uglyâ¦. Shown them 1 which can see the whole of my head and they all encourage me to send thatâ¦. FIAK! Anyway, I sent a lot of failure MMS to myself and wasted a lot of MMSâ¦ WASTE MONEY!!!    After settling the bill, we went to lucky plaza because Veron needed to change some Malaysian currency as she was going Genting today. I was still pondering about sending the MMS manâ¦ Then there was this sudden urge of sending so I DID! I DID!!! I wrote some words and then I pressed sendâ¦ KAOZ! You canât imagine how fucking nervous and tensed up I wasâ¦ INTENSED! Couple of mins later, I received a reply from darling and guess what he said;    âbaby!! Omg!! Muack!!! Ty honey!! I am so surprised!! Silly ger, u looked totally fine! Oh goshâ¦ Iâm lost 4 wordsâ¦ I luv u honey!â    KAKKAKAKAKK! I laughed and showed Min the message and she gave me a grin look! Hiak! We decided to walk on to Heeren and I am still rather nervous actuallyâ¦ Haizâ¦ I was thinking lucky he did not say I am ugly manâ¦ While browsing in one of the shop, I received a call from darling saying that he was so surprised to receive a MMS from meâ¦ Hurhur! We spoke a little while and hang up as he was still working. Mins later he called again with this really excited tone!! He said he was looking at me when suddenly he feels that I look like someone and after some thoughts, he finally see me as a resemblance to CHRISTY CHUNG!! I was like WTF!!!! I am so fat and ugly!! How could I look like CHRISTY CHUNG!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAK!! Wellâ¦ still I was very honoured and happy because he find me beautiful! Hurhur!!    We got out of Heeren and decided to walk to Parklane as both Min and me wanted to shed some fatsâ¦ Veron followed unknowingly till we reached Plaza Singapura and she asked where are we going. We laughed and said Parklane. Lets play some pool at this new and nice place that is near Mr. Bean. She refused to play pool and so she left with partner while Min and me continue our walk. Min asked if we wanna walk on till we are so tired then get on a cab and I was indeed, in a walking mood! I agreed and we continue walking the whole stretch of Little India. I donât really feel comfortable at all as those stupid black skin men keep staring at meâ¦ I felt intimidated by their stares and worse of all; I donât understand a single shit that they spoke! PUI! Those idiots were giving me stares like they were removing my clothes with their bare eyes! Anyway, we just took precaution as we walked onâ¦ Damn fucking tired alreadyâ¦. We were chatting while walking so its not that bad after allâ¦ Time flies when we are so engrossed in reaching our destination; MINSâ HOUSE!!! WTF! It took us 2 hrs to reached Balestier from Orchard man!! I was dead tired and thirsty! Got on a cab as soon as Min reached home! At that time, I took out my phone and saw 3 missed calls. Darling must be worried sick as I did not managed to pick up. I called him and told him I was too busy walking and also, I couldnât be bothered to even take my phone out. HURHUR!!!    Reached home around 11.30 and was asking Wendy how do I looked in that MMS that Iâve sent and she said I looked goodâ¦ Fine then, I shall believe I do looked good despite the fact that I think I looked uglyâ¦ Haiz! I took my shower and was waiting patiently for moi darling to call. Hee! At 2.15am, darling finally called and I was so happy! We chatted for a while and he have to go back to work le. I had this urge to call Eddie and chat up with him as I think he is still a friend after allâ¦ I seek my darlingsâ permission and he was a little reluctant but thought that itâs really all right so I went ahead.    I dialed Eddiesâ nos and was waiting for him to pick up. It took quite a while and he finally picked up my call and said, âOh hi, din expect you to call, can I call you back?â I said, âokie, go head with your things.â He called back shortly and told me he was rather busy and we started talking. Strange enough, he donât sound like he used to be and there was this occasion that he put me on hold and got back with a softer tone. What comes to my mind immediately was he had connected our conversation with a third party perhaps and worse come to worst, there might be more than just a third partyâ¦. Well, I did not care, as I believe so that I had nothing to hide in the first place so, I just behaved normally and continue chattingâ¦. He asked several weird questions like; do you have a boyfriend now? Where do you know him? Do I know him? Does he use a sate? WEIRD!! He knew that I am with moi darling since day 1 but why asked these questions???? FUCK CARE! We finished our conversation as soon as I received a call from darling.    Well, darling and I was really shocked and ambiguous towards all these nonsense that these people were doing and talking aboutâ¦ Itâs also true that we did not choose to hide anything but just that no one approached us about what is going on. They created stories, rumors, gossips and all with their slightest imagination. HAIZ! Well, there is this Chinese saying, âQing zhe zi qingâ. So long we are innocent and we did not do anything wrong, there is nothing worth racking our brains over such issues. Hee!! Oh, btw, I did a funny thing, I sent a 2nd MMS to my darling!!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAKA!!! DAMN FUCKING UGLY!! He claimed he like the last pic most! Weird! I think I looked ugliest thereâ¦. BLAB!!!    Well, I have to undergo an intensive weight losing program man! People please wish me luck! Jess needs support from you guys! Muack!!!! Another long long blogâ¦ I am so fucking chiong hei!!   Kisskiss!

      I Drive Myself Crazy~    Well, I fell in love with this song when I was in my early adulthood. I can still remember myself singing this song all day long. It's somehow or rather, one of my few favorite songs. Hurhur!    N Sync - I Drive Myself Crazy    ooooh....  Lying in your arms  So close together  Didn't know just what I had  Now I toss and turn  Cause I'm without you  How I'm missing you so bad  Where was my head?  Where was my heart?

      LIAR!    Okie, I know that I am one who hates liars but I myself am one big liar man! I lied to my darling that I was in Cineleisure yesterday. Hiak! Bad bad girl! Anyway, he uncovered the truth while reading my blog. WoooooOoooOooOOooo, I slapped myself real hard on my own face ya? AKKAKAKAK! Still, he was cool and told me that I need not lie to him at all. If I do not want to see him, he will not appear in front of me and if he happened to be at where I was, he would leave immediatelyâ¦ WHAT A FUCKING SWEET BOYFRIEND I HAVE! He always never fails to make me smile like a baby.    This blog was initially started with a thought in mind, just me and myself should read but now Iâve given 3 persons the honor to read too. Yvonne, SUGARFLY and moi darling. I enjoy reading people blogs and as for my own blog, it was meant as a future reference. Like maybe months later when I want to know what I had done for that particular day, I could actually retrieve this information just by 1 click. Darling only got to know about my blog address today but said he'll never read my blog again because he donât want me to lie to my own blog and he feels that he should respect my privacyâ¦ Well, sometimes, I think he is really mature for a 23 years old, compared to those monkeys that I had known for years! Should I change my blog title to âA Tribute To My Friendsâ? Kakakkakakakkakak!    Went to catch Harry Potter 3 with Yvonne and SF today. It was a disappointment like what SF had mentioned, NO PLOTS! Yaâ¦ Why is it not as good as the first 2 man? Hiak! After the show we went to ALIF for prata and then proceed to SFsâ home which is just mins of walk away. I was feeling a little reluctant initially because I was so warm and uncomfortable. Still, I was thinking no harm going up for just a quarter hour or so. Guess what, power failure again! Itâs like WTF!!!!! Why always power failure at the wrong time? I was feeling so warm and now, warmer! I couldnât stay on man. It was really too warm liao and so I decided to get a cab home immediately. I went off and started dialing my darlingsâ nos but the damn bloody fucking network is downâ¦ I panicked as I started imaging things happening to my dear boy. He is a cop and I am constantly worried of his well being. I called him for at least 20 times on my way home and decided to leave him SMS instead since itâs simply impossible to get him at allâ¦    Went into shower as soon as I settled down. I wanted to cool myself and also I wanted to make it a fast one so darling can have me for the rest of the night. Oh, school is starting next week manâ¦ The thought of it causes nauseaâ¦ I think I got addicted to this kinda slacking lifestyle man! WAHAHAHHAH! Now to the people reading my blog, cheers for friendship and cheers for opening up to one another. Love ya guys.    Kisskiss!

      MISUNDERSTANDING OR IT'S UNREASONABILITY?    Last night, I did something so wrongâ¦ Believe it or not, I was stupid enough to have felt so negative about darling just because he answered, âtry my bestâ for my question. It took me hours before I could bring myself to call him. I knew Iâd have to call because he canât sleep if I donât tuck him to bed but I simply refused to do so and at 12mn sharp, I received his sms.    âtis may b the last time I call u honey, as well as to wish u tisâ¦ but still, happy 1 mth n 25 days honeyâ¦â    I couldnât be bothered because I was too angry and disappointed. Wellâ¦ I waited till he messaged me again and this time, I decided that I can call him leâ¦ Hee! Making him wait for that couple of hours feeling paranoid is my way of punishing him. When I called him, he sounded real tired and also, dejected to a certain extent. I spoke with the coldest tone I could give and itâs probably the first time I ever spoke with him like that.    We argued for almost 1 hour, telling him how disappointed I was to hear him said, âtry my bestâ. What do you mean by try my best? I keep askingâ¦ I want to know his definition, his meaning, his stand and all that I can find out. I told him; I donât say try my best because itâs not a 100% positive answerâ¦ Itâs not a satisfying answer at all!! We talked it out, everything that could save this short and sweet love of ours.    Guess whatâ¦ I was so fucking shocked and guilty to know that he had requested a transfer just because there was one time I could not reached him on his mobile and I started imagining things which causes the lost of my appetite. He said he was really âxin tongâ when he heard that I did not eat much because I was too worriedâ¦ For that, the next day he typed a letter and sent to the Head Quarters, requesting for a change to office hours in the intelligence unit. I was so touched that I howled like a baby and asked him to forgive my negligence and also, my willfulness. He is so sweet and nice to me yet I still doubted his sincerity and had said so many things that probably penetrate his heart like a long sword, slicing the wound slowly and turning the blades again and again.    OMG! I wish I could just tell everyone how in love I am now and how fortunate I amâ¦ Thereâs probably not another person who loves me as much as he does. Reallyâ¦ This thought came to my mind immediately after our misunderstanding had been cleared. For this, he said our love leveled up again! **Tada** I must really bucked up and try losing as much weight as I can manâ¦ Though he thinks I am beautiful but thatâs the face onlyâ¦ My body is so fat that sometimes I feel like dying!! I hate this fat ass of mine!    Today was such a nice and peaceful day. Hurhur! I woke up at 1pm and was on the phone with my sweet baby. He woke up around the same time as I did though I slept lesser cause I always tuck him to bed first. Yvonne was supposed to be on the way and I actually expect her to be earlier but she only reached around 2.20pm. Guess she had a hard time finding her way cause my location sucks to the infinite! I wasted so much more money just on cab fare! I hate taking public transports like MRT or the buses because some people are so uncivilized and disgustingâ¦ Yvonne and I had lunch together then she went ahead with her tanning session. I peeped at her couple of times to see if she is having fun on her own. Hee! I was too lazy to go under the sun manâ¦ BLAB!    At the same time, I was playing Yahoo Graffiti with darling and Jun. It was rather fun because we get to draw and guess. I am always the slowestâ¦ I canât type fast maâ¦ Two fingers only okieâ¦. BLAB! I called Laura and we decided to meet up for dinner since she was in town, she wanted to go Harbour Front. Yvonne came backed after 2 hours and she went to bathe first. When she was done, I was still on the phone with darling. She nagged at me, saying, âzhen tian jiang dian hua, bu dong wei she mo jiang duo hua jiang!â HAHA! I went shower as soon as I put down the phone. Came out in 10 mins and started putting on my thick make up. AKKAKAKAKAK! They always say I looked so pale when I have no powder on my face.    We got to Harbour Front around 6pm and walked around for sometimes. I noticed a lot of people looking at me while I was walking, going up the escalator, taking money and even when I was talkingâ¦ WTF is wrong with these people! I feel so uneasy when people stare at meâ¦ Be it they are looking at my fats or my face or my hair or my dressing or my posture or the way I carry myself, I just hate it! The weirdest part, there was this man who came into the restaurant that I was dinning in who keep looking at me just because I was looking his directionâ¦. I was looking at those people behind him but seems like he thought that I was looking at him!!!! WTFX1O! I turned around and continue eating despite knowing the fact that he was looking at me all the whileâ¦. When I got up and proceed to the cashier, he stared at me from my table all the way to the cashier till I got outâ¦ FUCK THESE SICK AND HORNY BASTARDS!!!    Then we went to Mac Donalds to eat some ice cream. There was this super fucking ugly bitch sitting right opposite me and she too, keeps staring at me! WTFX100! She was with this short guy and both of them were chatting, I thought its only right to look at the person you are talking with but instead, she was constantly looking at meâ¦. UGLY BITCH! Maybe she thinks I am so fat or what but I couldnât be bothered cause, FAT CAN JIAN FEI BUT UGLY IS FOREVER! Unless she did some job to her face, then Iâd say, â SUAN NI TA MA DE HEN!â kakkakakakaka!    After Mac, Yvonne and Laura decided to head home and I was busy trying to find a place to go. I did not want to home because it was only 8pm and I think I looked damn beautiful today. Cannot just go home like that lahâ¦ PUI! DONâT PUKE PLEASE! Weili was engaged in a KTV session with Cai Yun in Clementi Party World. I wanted to go initially but heard some tone of reluctance and decided not to go then. Shhâ¦ CaiYunâs gf was there too lah! Then I called QP and PX but there were no replies from either of them and I got on the cab with disappointment thinking that Iâd just head home loh.    Surprises are always around when you least expect them. PX answered her phone and we decided to meet up at Jurong Point, that lousy place! Sianz but no choice man. I reached JP at around 8.15pm and we decided to catch a movie. I accompanied PX to the second level and she had her dinner while me played with her phone. It was fun taking MMS but too bad, when I decided to send one special pic to my darling, I realized that her phone cannot send any MMS at all. Not via infrared nor normal MMS services and guess what, I looked like a fucking 17 in that pic! KAKAKKAKA! Now I finally know why there were always people telling me I looked like 18 when I was doing my attachment. Sob sob! Guess this is what we meant by, you donât always get what you wantâ¦.    Caught The Day After Tomorrow and it was definitely a fantastic show. Right after the show, I got on a cab and came home right away. Darling was on the phone with me on my journey back. He misses me so much and it goes for me, I miss him like crazy too! Hee! Well, got home and smoke a little then took my bath. Tucked my little baby to bed and then got online to check out peopleâs blog. Yvonneâs blog was damn funny. I was laughing as I read. Mich is such a failure when comes to being a elder sister I must agree!    Oh, too long for a blog I guessâ¦ Seems like I am writing a storybook! Nite!   Kisskiss!

      TAKE ME AS I AM PLEASE?    When I asked darling if he would love me as I am, he said he'll try his best... Why? I have this sudden rush of disappointment... Would there be anyone who will love me like how Eric loves me? He is the only one... Only one who really loves me for who I am... Not for my looks and not for anything else...    The "try my best" really took my faith away... Uncertainty is all I can feel now... If you can't take me for who I am, then why waste time? Many people out there for you to pick and customise to the way you want your partner to be... Am I right?    It's a pity... Real pity. Perhaps it's only true that he can only remain as part of me, my memories... So sweet... So painful... So real and always so true.   Kisskiss!

      SUNDAY    Hah! What are fucking Sunday evening... Everyone went shopping at IMM. What a fuck up place. Anyway, I decided to stay at home because I can't stand those crowd and noise level... I will go crazy and dizzy and pukey if I stay for too long. Sianz! I am really feeling weird now... Disappointed actually.. I called Shamus wanting to know how he's doing but he doesnât give a fucking shit about me at all. Well, since I was not treated nicely so don't expect me to treat you good... I don't give a shit how you are doing now! Blame it on yourself pig! YEAH!    Speaking of Shamus... I was so shocked to see this pub in Tanjong Pagar by the name of Shamus ???? Can't recall the full name liao but it's pretty eye catching... What a spoiler... I was happily going to this place call MOX with WendyX2 and Suelyn. Scott and Angel were supposed to meet us later as she went back home to change some fucking shoes.... Anyway, MOX YOU SUCK BIG TIME U FUCKING BITCH! What a fuckX10 up place! No smoking inside the pub?? Screw all your mums and dads big time! And worst of all.... WE PAID FUCKING 4 BUCKS EACH TO GET OUR BIG FAT ASSES IN! SCREW YOU!    Haiz... Sis was very shocked that we are actually taking her to a Lesbians' place... KAKKAKAKAKAK! She was so reluctant to even go in but was convinced by some guys who got out from the lift and went into MOX. Guess what, those were the people working there!!!! KAKKAKAKAKAKAKAKKA! We left the place soon as we got in. I think just less than 10 mins. Sis was fascinated by the dÃ©cor but too bad, too much of a cons for us to stay. Well, we proceed to the next destination that is on the second level. Weird place that changes concept like every few week. To my surprise that night we went, the theme is CLOUD. That theme got me all excited because CLOUD is my darling. I am rain and he is cloud. KAKKAKAKAK!    Ant is the name of the place I was talking about. The place is very big and empty. There are a lot of white balloons and also big white tents that looks like a cloud because of a blower blowing the tents up. We ordered drinks and waited for Angel and Scott and come. Stayed there for approximately 2 and half hours. It was a boring place overallâ¦ Suelyn wanted so much to see her lover at Cha Xuan and so we decided to sing for the rest of the night! We moved outta Ant and walked along the road, making our ways to Cha Xuan. Scott and I were chatting a lot as we walked on. I think he is quite a nice person lah. Anyway, so long as my sis is happy can liao. I donât really careâ¦ She changes boyfriend like changing g-strings!    When we reached Cha Xuan it was 12.45 already and we had the room till 3am. They ordered a bottle of vodka and we had some vodka lime and screwdriverâ¦. I donât have to pay because it was my post birthday celebration! Sweet! I seriously hope that it was Gin instead of vodkaâ¦. SAD! I did not sing much as they were too noisy and I donât like singing when people get too noisy. I went outta the room and speak with my darling on the phone insteadâ¦ When the time strike 3 and I was the most eager to leaveâ¦ SIANZ! Sis was too tired as she did not sleep well the previous night and as for Wendy, she was a little too high but not drunk. Suelyn went supper with those people working there.    We got on the cab and decided to head home. On the way back, Wendy wanted to puke and asked me to pass her a plastic bagâ¦ She then winded down the window and started puking. The car was moving in a very fast speed and she is sitting right in front of me! I couldnât help but to imagine her missing the bag and the strong wind blew all the puke on my face! I was telling her I felt threatened as I really donât wanna suffer a second time the same old shitâ¦ She puked on me years back when we were still some stupid teenagers! Sis laughed at my remarks and went back to sleep soon after. Great!    Home finally and called darling to tell him I am safe. He was so tired but still insisted of speaking with meâ¦ I knew he misses me a lot and so did I. I was very lost and tired because so many things happened. Wellâ¦ all I can say is, whatâs gone is goneâ¦ Things will never be the same again and I would want to love him like the way I do 6 years ago. Now, I only have eyes for my skinny, ugly piggy darling of mine! Hee!!    So thatâs all for today folks! I am going to watch channel 8 now and later got Steven Chowâs Tang Bo Hu Dian Qiu Xiang.   Kisskiss!

      Guys, pardon me for my change of blog address as I was so pissed and shocked to realise that there were more than just the three of you reading... So I decided to delete the old one and give this new one a better name. Hurhur!
