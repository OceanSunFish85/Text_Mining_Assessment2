      12 Jun 2004  I had arrived in Sydney for more than 4 months. Remember the first day I came here, exited, scare, many difficult feeling from my heart. But now, all the things had settled and my first exam in Australia is nearly come.  By the times, I am missing Hong Kong very much, my family, my friends and my students. Their faces always appear in my brain, I want to go back to meet them as soon as possible.   ä¸ç¥ä¸è¦ºå¨äºæå°¼å·²ç¶4åæäºãéè¨å¾ç¶æç¬¬ä¸å¤©ä¾å°çæåï¼å¿è£¡åèå¥®ãç·å¼µï¼ä½åå¸¶é»æå¿ï¼ççæé»ä¸ç¥ææ¨£å¥½ãä½å¹¸å¥½ï¼ç¾å¨ææçæ±è¥¿é½å·²ç¶å®é å¥½ï¼èæäº¦é½æå¥äºæ¾³æ´²ççæ´»ï¼éæä¸ææä¾¿æ¯æå¨æ¾³æ´²çç¬¬ä¸åèè©¦ï¼å¸æå¹³å¹³ç©©ç©©çä¾¿å¯ä»¥ã  è©±éå¦æ­¤ï¼æéå¾æä½é¦æ¸¯çæ¯ä¸åäººï¼æçå±ä¼äººï¼æçæåï¼éææçå­¸çãä½ åçæ¨£å­å¸¸å¸¸å¨æçè¦æµ·ä¸­æµ®ç¾ï¼ççå¥½æ³å¿«é»é£è¿é¦æ¸¯æ¢ä½ åãç­ï¼å¥½å¿«å°±å¯ä»¥è¦å°ä½ åçã

      On 28 May, Gavin came and picked me after his works,what for? Because we will go down to South Coast for holdiay tonight. We will go to Tim's house also with Tim. Before the driving, we needed to go and buy the drinks first, also got KFC for our dinner.  Then we drove to there at 20:45, it's cost us for 2 hours to get there, long driving. In the car, I slept for a while, so I missed out the dounut. :-( When we arrived, there are many starts in the sky, beautiful.  In Tim's house, there is a snooker table, cool, long time havent play that, its let me remember the club house of Austin Villa in China. My family holiday house.   On the next morning, I woke up and Gavin bought me to the beach, the water was cold, and I collected some shells from the beach and we saw the dolphins are far far away from us, near to the end of the other sides. So we just seee the small spot going out from the water and back to it. The fishs and chips for lunch are fresh, delicious. For our dinner at RSL, the oysters are cool, and chicken.   On sunday, my driving day. Firstly, drove to golf club to play golf for 9 holes, tired. Then drove around and then just Gavin and me went to RSL for dinner again. It cost me to drive for about 20 mins to get there, and also some cars follow me and opposite way to me. I can felt that how the feeling was when driving on the road, a little bit scare when driving through the roundabout, quite difficult.   On monday, my birthday, we went to Norwe for lunch, the meat pie and chocolate cake. Then on the way back to Sydney, many horse, cow and ostrich in the farm, cool. :-) Then back home to leave the bag. And went to Chinatown for diner, chinese food. I liked it very much. My birthday was happiest, unforgettable for the nice trip and its a good memory in my deep heart.  5æ28æ¥ï¼ç¶Gavinæ¾å·¥ä¹å¾ä¾¿ä¾æ¥æï¼å»éï¼å»åéçå°æ¹å°éå¹¾å¤©ãæåæå»Timçæ¸¡åå±ãä½åºç¼ä¹åï¼æåè¦å»è²·é£²ååï¼åé£æé¤ï¼é£å·¦è¯å¾·éã è·èæåå¨æä¸8:45åºç¼ï¼éæ2åå°æï¼å¥½é·çæç¨ãå¨æéä¸­ï¼æç¡èäºï¼æä»¥æé¯éäºdounutã:-( ä½æåå°éçæåï¼å¤©ä¸æè¬åé¡ææï¼å¥½éåã ä¿Timçå±è£¡é¢ï¼ææ±ballæï¼æå¾ä¹æ²¡ææéäºãéä»¤æåæ³èµ·æèè±ä¿å¤§é¸çæ¸¡åå±ï¼ä¿å¨çªç¦ºåèå¥å¢ï¼ç°å¢åªç¾ã  ç¬¬äºææ¸æ©ï¼Gavinå¸¶æå°æ²çæ¼«æ­¥ï¼æµ·æ°´åä»½å°å·ï¼ä½æµ·æ°´æ¸æ¾è¦åºï¼æéæ¾äºä¸äºæ¼äº®çè²æ®¼ï¼æä»²å¯ä»¥è¦å°ææµ·è±å¨é èè·³åºæ°´é¢å¢ï¹è·èå»è²·äºä¸äºæµ·é®®ä½çºåé¤ï¼å¥½å³ãæé¤å°±å»äºä¸åææåï¼åäºçè±ªåéã  æææ¥ï¼ä¿æçé§è»æ¥ï¼Gavinè©±ä»æ¥å»éé½ä¿æé§è»ï¼å çºéè£¡æ¯è¼å°äººï¼æä»¥åé©ãé¦åï¼æè¦é§è»å»å¥ç¾å¤«çå ´ï¼æåå¨æè£¡æå¥ç¾å¤«çï¼å±æäº9åæ´ï¼å¥½ç²å¦åãè·èå¨åå»ä¸ï¼æä¸åé§åºå¸é®é£æé£¯ï¼åä¿å»ææé£ãä»æ¬¡ä¿ä¸åæ¯è¼é·çé§é§ï¼ç¨äºå¤§ç´20åéï¼èä¸ä¿å¨å¬è·¯ä¸ï¼æç¬¬ä¸æ¬¡æåå°æè»è·èæçæè¦ºãæé»é©æï¼èä¸ä»²è¦éåæèï¼æé»é£åº¦ã  ææä¸ï¼5æ31æ¥ä¿æççæ¥ï¼æåå»äºåéçä¸åå°é®é£åé¤ï¼åäºå¥½ç¾å³çèé¤¡é¤åæ±å¤åèç³ãè·èåé§è»è¿æå°¼ãéä¸­ç¶éå¾å¤çè¾²å ´ï¼æé¦¬ãçåé´é³¥ï¼å¥½å¾æåã :-) ä¹å¾åå®¶æ¾ä½è¡æå¾ä¾¿åºäºåäººè¡é£æé£¯ãå çºä»æææ³é£ä¸­é¤ãä»å¹´ççæ¥ï¼ççå¥½éå¿ï¼ææ°¸é é½ä¸æå¿è¨éåæç¨ï¼å®æå¨æçæ·±å¿èå¸¸å¸¸çæµ®ç¾ã

      27 May 2004  Very exciting. I hope tomorrow come quickly. This is the first time I go for few days with my boy friend. As before, just go for 1 day with my ex-bf. I hope it will be a nice memory.   Today, the marks of Quantity Survey had posted, luckily, I passed! I am happy because last time, I had bad marks, and for this time, because I want to go and wait for him to leave his works, so I just use 1 day to finish this assignment, then go out to play for 2 days. For those I handed out on time, I got 1 bonus mark because the lecturer had extended the due date, so who handed out on time can have 1 bonus mark.   Last night, I had a nice dream with Gavin and Tim about while we are driving on the road, a police talked with them in Meridian, then I needed to translate to them, but while I am translating, I spoke Cantonese, then they laugh out loudly :-( then I spoke in English again to them. At that time, I also had woke up and laugh for a while!  Tonight, I should have a good sleep and waiting for tomorrow coming. :-)  å¥½ç·å¼µåï¼å¿«é»åå°æå¤©å¦ãå çºæå¤©ä¿æç¬¬ä¸æ¬¡åèªå·±åç·æåå»æè¡ï¼ä»¥åé½åªä¿åååº¦ç·æåå»éä¸æ¥çæè¡å§äºãå¸ææä¸åæå¿«çæç¨ã  ä»å¤©ï¼ç¬¬äºä»½çæ¸¬éåèª²æçµæï¼åæ ¼åãç¾å¨ä¿æ¾³æ´²è®æ¸ï¼åæ ¼å°±å·²ç¶å¥½éå¿çåï¹ä»æ¬¡æåªå¥½äºä¸å¤©çæéä¾¿åå®éä»½åèª²ï¼å çºçºäºåGavinå»è¡ï¼ååãä½ä¿äº¦é½æå¥½èï¼å çºæææ¨é²äºäº¤åèª²çæéï¼ä½æ¯å¦ææºæäº¤çè©±ä¾¿å¯ä»¥æå 1åãç¡ææå äº1åï¼çéå¿ï¼å¯ä»¥ç¨ä¾è£è¿ä¸æ¬¡æ¬ ç1åã  æ¨æï¼æç¼äºä¸åæéGavinåTimçå¤¢ï¼ä¿æéæåå¨è·¯ä¸é§è»ï¼å¿½ç¶æä¸è­¦å¯åæåè¬è©±ï¼ä»æ¯èªªæ®éè©±çï¼è·èæä¾¿ç¿»è­¯çµ¦GavinåTimç¥ï¼ä½æä¸ç¥ä¸è¦ºå°ç¨å»£æ±è©±åä»åè¬ï¼ä»åä¾¿å¿ä¸ä½å¤§ç¬ :-( (æä¾¿é£å¿ç¨è±æåç¿»è­¯å¤ä¸æ¬¡ãèä¸å¨é£ä¸å»ï¼æé©ééä¾ï¼éåå¨åºä¸ç¬äºåºä¾ï¼æä¹è¦ºå¾èªå·±ç¾ç´ãä½ä¹å¾å°±å¥½å¥½è¨ï¼ç­å¾èæå¤©çä¾è¨ã :-)

      26 May 2004  Today is the birthday of Florence, I called her today. I found that she had a little bit disappointed, but not for those I called her, just for her mind. May be she had a large pressure in her works. Don't give up, I will always support you and besides you.   And today, Gavin confirmed me that we will go to South Coast on Friday. I am glad to hear about that. I felt exciting, it the first time I go with my boy friend. Also Tim, I am happy he will go also, he is a nice person. But before that, I need to finish one of the assignment that will hand out on next Monday(my birthday), pity, but finally, I had finished that, just waiting for Eric's one and combined. Besides, I started another assignment, about contract law, its difficult.   In the afternoon, we go for chinese tea in Chinatown, the food is delicious, and we have a happy lunch time to each other. I enjoy in it much, I hope you will be there next time, can you?  ä»å¤©æ¯Florenceççæ¥ï¼æç¹ææåé»è©±çµ¦å¥¹ï¼å¥¹å¥½é«èãä½æè¦ºå¾å¥¹æé»ä¸éå¿ï¼æ¯å çºå¥¹è¿å·¥å¤ªå¤§å£åãä¿¾å¿æ©åï¼æææ¯æä½ çã  éæï¼Gavinåæè¬å¨æ¬ææäºæåæå»åéç©ãç¶ç¶å¥½éå¿å¦ï¼èä¸å¥½èå¥®çãéæ¯æç¬¬ä¸æ¬¡åç·æåå»æè¡ãä¸éå¶å¯¦ä»²æGavinçæåTimï¼ä½¢å¥½å¥½äººçãä½å»ä¹åï¼æä¸å®è¦åå®æçå ±åï¼å°æå¾æåå¥½æèªå·±é£äºé¨ä»½ï¼åªå©ä¸Ericçé¨ä»½ãèä¸æéè¦åæ³å¾çåèª²ï¼ä¿å¯«è«æã  ä¸åï¼æåä¸ç­åå­¸åå»äºåäººè¡é£²è¶ãå¥½å¥½å³ãå¸æä¸æ¬¡ä»ä¹å¯ä»¥å»è©¦ä¸å¦ã

      25 May 2004 Today I had the first presentation in UNSW. Fortunately, it's good, the lecturer said that our power point are very nice, and our content are descriptive, actually, I dont know it good or not?! I just want to pass all the subjects only. For Credit, Distinction, I dont care. I just want to finish my degree here. For the study here is not the same as Hong Kong, as Hong Kong, I can thinking for getting higher grade, but here, I cant.  ä»å¤©ä¿æå¨æ°åå¨ç¾æ¯å¤§å­¸çç¬¬ä¸åæ¼èª¬ãå¹¸å¥½ï¼åå¾å¹¾å¥½ï¼èä¸åææé½èªªæåçåç«åå¾å¥½å¥½ï¼éæå¥½è¶³å¤ çå§å®¹ï¼ä½éæ¨£åç¥ä¿å¥½å®åå¥½ï¼æé½åªæ±åæ ¼çï¼æç¡æé«ä»½ï¼æé½ä¸æ¢æãæåªæ³é é å©å©å®æåå­¸ä½ä¾¿å¯ä»¥ãä½æ¾³æ´²è®æ¸ççæ¯é¦æ¸¯å°é£ï¼å¨é¦æ¸¯å¯ä»¥å®¹æåå°å¥½çæç¸¾ï¼ä½å¨éè£¡ä¸æ¯å®¹æçã

      The last weekend, I stayed in Gavin's house for 3 days. It is because his mum and dad had go travelling, so that just remine him at home. So, he asked me to go to his house, so that he can cooked for me! The food he cooked were delicious, potato, spagetti, taco, all of them are taste very good, and also the the big breadfast.  I am happy these few days, because I can see him every day when I went to bed or when I woke up, but my examination is coming, so I also need to work hard on my studies, and you, you should work hard on your works. Also to all my friends, we work hard together to have a better resulf in the coming future.  å¨ååéäºçé±æªï¼æå»äºGavinå±ä¼ä½å·¦3æ¥ãå çºä»çå®¶äººå»äºæè¡ï¼æä»¥å¾ä½¢ä¸åä¿å±ä¼ï¼å æ­¤ä»å«æå»ä»å±ä¼ï¼é£éº¼ä»ä¾¿å¯ä»¥ç®é£¯ä¿¾æé£ï¹ä»ç®çæ±è¥¿å¥½ç¾å³çï¼æè¯å¡ï¼æç²ï¼tacoï¼åç¥ä¸­æä¿å©ï¼ä¿æåç®åä½ä¸äºæ´è¥ï¼èç¢ï¼èå£«ï¼æ±ï¼ï¼å¨é¨é½å¥½å¥½å³ï¼ä»²æä¸åå¥½è±å¯çæ©é¤ã  ä¿éä¸æ¥ï¼æççå¥½éå¿ï¼å¯ä»¥æ¥æ¥é½è¦å°ä½¢ï¼å°¤å¶ä¿ä¸èµ·èº«åè¨è¦ºä¹åï¼ä½æçèè©¦å¥½å¿«ä¾¿å°ï¼æè¦ä¿¾å¿æ©æº«æ¸ï¼ä½ é½è¦ä¿¾å¿æ©åéåãéææåæçæåï¼ä½ åé½è¦ä¿¾å¿æ©ï¼æåå¤§å®¶ä¸é½åªåï¼ç­å¾ç¾å¥½çå°å¤çä¾è¨ã

So, no more mood to study. But the last one on 2 July, bad, it is Management, very difficult, as before, I like this subject very much, but now I hate that one.

      29 June 2004 Today, I had finished the second subject of the examination. Very tired, actually, the examination today was open book examination, but not much time to do that. It is because today is having QS examination, we needed to do 4 questions within 3 hours, not plenty of time. Luckily, I can finished all of them.  And today, I had posted the birthday present to my lovely sister and my dad. I hope they will like that!  ä»å¤©çµæ¼èå®ç¬¬äºç§èè©¦ãéç¶éåèè©¦ä¿å¯ä»¥ç¨æ¸ï¼ä½ä¹å¾ç²å¦åï¼èä¸ä¸æ¯å¥½å¤ æéåãéä»½å·ä¿èæ¸¬éï¼è¦ä¿ä¸åå°æè£¡ååæ¢åé¡ï¼ççåå¤ å¥½è¶³å¤ æéãä½å¹¸å¥½ï¼æå¯ä»¥å«ååå¾å®ã  éæï¼ä»å¤©å»äºéµå±å¯äºå®¶å§åç¸ç¸ççæ¥ç¦®ç©è¿é¦æ¸¯ãå¸æä½¢å°æé¾æå¦ï¹

      02 July 2004 Finally, I finished all the examination on 2 July, and these few days, Gavin stay at my house, because he is during his 5 days holidays. Also his grandpa and his grandpa's gf had came from New Zealand to Australia for few days, so we had dinner at his house and went to the club with them.  å¨7æ2æ¥çµæ¼èå®è©¦å¦ï¼èä¸å¨éæ¸å¤©ï¼Gaviné½å¨æçå®¶ï¼å çºä»æ5å¤©çå¤§åãéæä»ççºçºåä»çºçºçå¥³æåå¾æ°è¥¿è­ä¾äºæ¾³æ´²æè¡ï¼æä»¥Gavinçåª½åªå«æå»ä»å±ä¼é£é£¯åå»åä»åå»clubã  03 July 2004 And last Saturday night, when we back from Padstow, while Gavin was looking out from my bedroom's window, he saw a fire happened in the house opposite to the road, and at that time, I am talking with my mum on phone, then Gavin quickly rang "000" for the fire station. It happened in the kitchen of that house while a girl is cooking the chips. After a while, there had an explorsion from the window, then the fire to the roof, horrible. After that, I called mum back and told her what had happening, she asked me to take extra care. Luckily, Gavin was here with me, otherwise, I dont know what I can do.  å¨ææå­ï¼å¨Gavinå±ä¼é£å®æé£¯åå°æå®¶ï¼ç¶ææ­£ç¶åæåª½åªå¾ç·é·éé»è©±ï¼Gavinæåºè¡è¦å°å°é¢è¡æéå±ç«ç­ï¼ä»ç«æè·å°æ¨ä¸åæ"000"ãåä¾ä¿æåå¥³ä»å¨å»æ¿ç®è¯æ¢å¼è³èµ·ç«ãéäºä¸æï¼ä¾¿è½å°çç¸è²ï¼è·èå¨å±é ä¹å¯ä»¥è¦å°ç«ï¼å¥½æãä¹å¾ï¼æåæè¿é»è©±ä¿¾åª½åªåç¥å¥¹ï¼å¥¹å«æå°å¿é»åãå¨é£ä¸å»ï¼å¹¸å¥½Gavinï¼ä¸æ¯çè©±æé½åç¥é»ç®å¥½ã

      02 Aug 2004 Last week, the winter holiday had finished and already back to school. In this winter holiday, I had went skiing for 3 days, very good. But the university had started, and I said to myself that I need to be more hard working than last semester. Besides, in this winter holiday, Gavin spent many time with me, I am glad :-)  On last Saturday, Gavin bought me to watch an expo, it's about sex, I had never watch such stuff, interesting. The people at there will not feel shy, this the different between chinese and foreign people.
