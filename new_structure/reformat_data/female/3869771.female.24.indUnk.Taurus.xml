      NO BIRDS IS TOO HIGH UP IN THE SKY FOR YOU TO SHOOT DOWN. NOTHING IS FOR FREE. REAP WHAT YOU SOW. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. LIFE AND LOVE, IS LIKE MUSIC, THERE ARE UPS AND DOWNS, TIMES WHICH HARD AND SOFT. THINGS ARE ALWAYS BEYOND OUR MEANS. DO NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED. WHEN WE SEEK TO DISCOVER THE BEST IN OTHERS AND BY CHANCE, WE SOMEHOW BRING OUT THE BEST IN OURSELVES. DON'T UNDERMINE YOUR WORTH BY COMPARING YOURSELF WITH OTHERS, IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE DIFFERENT THAT EACH OF US IS SPECIAL.

      hey guys...what's up. well i'm now busy building another website for my poems...and also busy with my Wendy Gonzalez website (latin actress)....so happy that now I'm a free person. Didn't came across my mind that it is just 10 days after my resignation day. Can feel that my mind and soul is at peace now now. However quite boring. I think I can deal with that. i will update you guys with my poems website..i'm very happy that Wendy's mother had actually updated me with Wendy's new soap opera...and due to wendy tight schedule she actually asked her mum to email me instead...im so touch man...hehehe..take care kammy
