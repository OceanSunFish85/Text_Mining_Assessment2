      So, I met someone interesting on an edating site. Just my luck, the guy turned out to be a psychologist whospecializes in couples counseling. The irony of it! He is also the author of not one, but two books on love, and achieving successful romantic relationships. Let me just say that, at first I thought this is what God had in store for me after a bitter divorce and eleven years of dating, thank you Lord! I thought: this is what it's gonna take to turn this old stubborn girl around. We met, and he was nice to look at. Not drop-dead gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, but nice looking in a granola-crunch kind of way. We seemed to hit it off, and to my surprise, the conversation was mostly lively, even if it was punctuated with a few uncomfortable silences here and there, which immediately prompted him to jump into couselor mode,and ask thoseseemingly harmlessquestions that arecarefullydesigned to provide insight into the depth of my very soul. Ahhh, not playing that game, I thought, and gave him my best trick answers! We met twice, first for coffee (always good for a quick escape) and then for dinner at a carefully selected Mexican restaurant. How considerate, I thought, when he suggested we try a restaurantin my part of town-- he's nice to think of all the hours I must spend driving back and forth to work, about 50 miles a day. Lest I hold that impression for too long, things took a turn for the worse, when, after a nice meal, he pulled out a discount coupon (carefully cut out of the local paper) and handed it to the waitress, right before my eyes. I realized in an instant I wasa "two-meals for the price of one"kind of deal. I don't know why, but my thoughts turned to his cats. Those poor cats. Beware of a man that has lived alone for ten years and constantly talks about his cats. Thisperson's desire to connect romantically with another human being was limitedby his inability to move beyonda particularrepertoire of possibilities.How is it such asmallsymbolic gesture couldmake me feel at once absent and negated? My dissapointment must have shown, for when we parted ways, he left in a haste.He gave me aperfunctory hug outside the restaurant (I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable to the touch it felt), and he briskly walked away towards his car. I was left standing in the parking lot, more than a few feet away from my car, watching him walk away. It reminded me of a movie scene, the one where she thenturns around slowly and walks to her car, puts the key in the ignition, and drives away into the comfort of absolute darkness.

      Another blank page... A friend told me the best way to overcome writer's block was just to start writing. Stream of consciousness-style. It doesn't have to make sense, it just IS. I've been staring at a blank screen for days now, wondering what I will write. Nothing makes sense, nothing comes out right. Could I be paralized by fear? Why wouldn't I be able to do this? I've always risen to the challenge and now I feel like I am on the brink of collapse! I like to think I am the one that comes to aid others, the rescuer, or at the very least, the provider of sometimes sage advice, and a kind word or two. But I am utterly unable to treat myself in the same way. Why do I put myself in this situation? It is completely by choice! I could go about quietly, staying put, not making waves, choosing to step just slightly outside of the lines, wanting to color in full bloom, when I could have wandered slowly in between the blue-gray aisles, watching my toes, so as not to stub them in an unclaculated move. Ugh. My stomach reminds me I am on a deadline. I WILL produce, and I will make it worth the wait.
