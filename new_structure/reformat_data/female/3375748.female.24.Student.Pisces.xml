      I am learning how to take nice pictures now. It's good for my boring life now, and I should use my free time to study something that I always wanna. From last week, I almost took one roll of film everyday. Of cause, I am not the only one who taking pictures, Toshi does it too. But, most of those pictures are taken by me. Since I like to look at pictures and take or be taken, I hope I could know how to take good pictures as Toshi, Tadayoshi, Kenji, Bon... .  But, I can't be so good now. I am just starting, so I have a lot of bad pictures. Only 1/3 pictures of one film are good enough to be kept. I went to RITZ CAMERA for pictures a lot, and they ask me buy the card everytime. Finally, I bought it today. I think I am too rely on my digital camera because I can see what the picture will look like before I take it, it make my eyes not good enough to see the beauty though the view window of normal camera. I have to learn how to do it without digital camera. I spend a lot of money because of that, but I remember my professor of photo class told us that the only way to improve the skill is continua taking pictures. I am not a smart person who have the talent, so I guess I will use the idiot way. Hope I could be better in the future.  æ°æ­»æäºå¦ï¼ï¼ï¼åææäºä¸æ¬¡ä¸­æçï¼ç»æä¸ç¥éä»ä¹åå å¿½ç¶åæä¹±ç ï¼ï¼ï¼å®³å¾æç°å¨è¦éæ°æä¸æ¬¡ã  æè¿å¦ï¼æå¼å§å­¦ä¹ å¦ä½æå½±äºãå ä¸ºä¸ç´ä»¥æ¥æé½å¾åæ¬¢çé£äºæ¼äº®çå¾çï¼ä¸åªæ¯ç¾å¥³å¸å¥çï¼è¿æé£åäººæçãèªå·±ä¹å¾ç¾¡æé£äºå¯ä»¥æåºç¾ä¸½ä¸ççæå½±å¸ï¼æè§å¾ä»ä»¬çå¾å¾äºä¸èµ·ï¼å¯ä»¥å¸¦ç»äººä»¬ç¾çæåãæä»¥èªå·±ä¹å¸æè½è¿éè¿èªå·±çç¼ççè§é£ä¹ç¾ä¸½çäºç©ã  ä»ä¸ä¸ªææå¼å§ï¼æ¯å¤©é½ä¼æç§çãå ä¹æ¯ä¸å¤©å°±è¦ç¨æä¸å·24çè¶å·ï¼å¯æ¯æ¯æ¬¡ä¹å°±åªæä¸åä¹ä¸çç§çå¯ä»¥ä¿å­èµ·æ¥ãå¶å®çé½ä¸æ¯å¾å¥½ï¼ææ³åå¼å§åºè¯¥é½æ¯è¿æ ·çï¼æ¢æ¢æ¥å°±å¥½äºå§ãåæ¥å¤ªä¾èµæ°ç ç¸æºï¼å ä¸ºæ°ç ç¸æºçå¤§çªå£å¯ä»¥è®©ä½ æåçå°ç§çæååçæ ·å­ï¼æä»¥ç¨æ°ç ç¸æºç§åºç§çåºç¶é½ä¸éãä¹å ä¸ºå¦æ­¤ï¼äººçç¼çå°±åå¾ææ°èµ·æ¥äºãæä»¥ï¼ç°å¨çæä¸æ³ä¾èµæ°ç ç¸æºäºï¼å¸æè½è¿èªå·±ç§åºæ¼äº®çç§çæ¥ã  å æ²¹å§ï¼ï¼ï¼

      Yesterday was start with a dog and end with a dog. I woke up around 7:40 a.m to drive Toshi and Masa to work. It is my daily routine now. I walked to downstairs after Toshi. When I was just out of my house, Toshi was already beside my car. Then, I saw a HUGE dog, which was walking beside my car. I don't know why but I was scared by that dog, and scream out. That dog was so innocent, and she/he looked at me a little bit, then walked away as nothing happened. I mean, there wasn't anything happened, but she/he was too normal compare to me. I felt funny few mins later 'cause I was not scared when I just saw that dog. I was more like: huh, a big dog... ... ... Scare!!!  Later that night, after we came back from diner with all those co-workers. We saw a small dog which ran with three legs. We met him before, and Toshi was trying to catch him once. That dog has four legs, but he only use three legs to run or walk, maybe the last leg is broken or something. I think that dog remembers us, at least Toshi. He saw us came out of the car and saw Toshi went to him, he started to run. Toshi went after him, who knows, Toshi was faster then him. So, he gave up running and try to fight with Toshi. I watched them from far away then decided open the door first. When I turn around to my house, I saw another dog!!!!! And, he was sitting not so far from me and looking at me. So, I didn't move or do anything, I just kept my post and looked at him too. We looked at each other for more than 30 seconds. Then, Toshi came back, that dog stand up and ran away.  What a dog day!!!!! But, the last dog was cute.   æ¨å¤©çæ¯å¾ççä¸å¤©ãæ©ä¸å¨7ï¼40å·¦å³èµ·æ¥åï¼éæåæ­£å»ä¸ç­ãåä¸äºæ¥¼ï¼å°±çè§ä¸åªå¤§çåæèµ°æ¥ãä¸ç¥éä¸ºä»ä¹æå±ç¶è¢«åå°äºï¼ï¼ï¼å¶å®é£åªçæ²¡ä»ä¹å¯æçï¼åªæ¯æç¹å¤§ï¼é¿å¾è¿æºåè¼çãæä¸å¼å§ä¹æ²¡è¢«åå°ï¼å°±æ¯çè§äºä¸åªå¤§çèå·²ï¼å¯æ¯èæµ·ä¸­éªè¿âä¸åªå¤§çâåï¼ä¸ç±èªä¸»å°å«äºåºæ¥ãååï¼èªå·±é½è§å¾æç¹å¥½ç¬ã  æä¸åæ¥çæ¶åï¼å±ç¶éè§äºä¸¤åªçãç¬¬ä¸åªæ¯é¿éè§çä¸åªå°çï¼ä»æææåæ¡è¿ï¼å¯æ¯åªç¨ä¸æ¡è¿è·ï¼ææ³å¯è½é£æ¡ä¸è½è·çè¿æ­æäºå§ãæçè§ä»å°±æ³æä»æ¿è¿æ¥æ±æ±ï¼å¯æ¯é£å°çä¸è§äººå°±è·ãæåæ¥æè¿½è¿ä»ï¼å¯æ¯å¤±è´¥äºãè¿æ¬¡ä»å±ç¶è·çæ¯é£åªå°çå¿«ï¼åæ¥å°çä¸å¾ä¸æ¾å¼ç»§ç»­è·ï¼å¯æ¯å±ç¶æç®åææä¸æ¶ãæç«å¨æ¯è¾è¿çå°æ¹çæåé£åªå°çï¼å³å®ååå®¶çå¥½ï¼ä¸è½¬èº«ï¼å±ç¶çè§å¦ä¸åªçãè¿åªçå¹²å¹²ååï¼é¿å¾ä¹æºå¯ç±çãä»åå¨ç¦»æä¸è¿çå°æ¹ï¼å®å®ééçççæãæä¹æ²¡æä»ä¹å¨ä½ï¼ä¹å®å®ééçççä»ãæä»¬è¿æ ·å¤§æ¦æç»­äºå¤è¿30ç§çæ ·å­ï¼ç´å°æèµ°è¿æ¥ï¼é£åªå°çæç«èµ·æ¥ï¼æºæºè¾¾è¾¾çèµ°äºã  ä¸å¤©å±ç¶çè§ä¸æ¡çï¼é½æ²¡æä¸»äººãè½ç¶æ²¡æä»ä¹å¥½æå¹çï¼ä½æ¯è§å¾è¿æ¯è®å¥½ç©ã

      Huh! Got up around 7:30 again!!! It has being like this snice end of Aplil. I don't remember how many nights that I fell in sleep without clean myslef up and change clothes before 11 p.m . So different with the life I had before.   I kind of like the things that I am doing now and life that I am live in now. I don't really like to stay late and do broing things. I guess I hadn't been myself for a while last year and now it's coming back.   Just hoping that I won't go back to before after this summer. I want try to live right. Not playing around and being like teenager.

      Something happened which made me so mad yesterday. I went to do laundry yesterday's afternoon in Fairfield. As always, after I put my laundry in dryer, I went to wash my car. The car wash place just 2 mins away from laundry shop. I spend around 30 mins wash my car after that I went back to pick up my laundry. Around 4:30, I walked out from laundry shop and tried to open my car.   THEN!!! A white American guy walked to me and asked me if I saw a wallet at car wash place. I told him I didn't. He kept ask me and looked into my car like searching for something at the same time. I wanted make sure if he said is the car wash place, so I asked him where he was asking. I made sure that he was talking about the car wash place that I went to around a hour ago, and I told him that I am sure I didn't see any wallet. Then, he asked me if I was leaving or not, I told him I was. He started to using his cell phone save my plate number. I was confused by his action, and I ask him:" You think I stole your wallet?!!" He kept save my plate number and said:" Yes, I think you stole my girlfriend's wallet." I was SO surprised, and I said:" What? That's so stupid!!!" He walked away from me and my car. I looked at him and he got in a white car which I noticed was parking beside my car over car wash place. So, I went to there, and saw that girl who was washing that white car inside of that car. I walked to the driver side door and asked her:" You think I stole your wallet? " She said:" No." I said:" That's so stupid!!! Do you want search my car??!!! I haven't go home yet.!!" She said:" No, I don't wanna search your car." I was so mad at that I told her that I don't even know what her wallet looks like, and I went to close to her car once because I needed the cleanser for my car window, and I had to cross her car to get it.

      Yeah! We went to Six Flags on last Sunday!!!! Finally!!! The group members are Koji, Mayumi, Sugiyama, Kayoko, Masa, Toshi and I. We met at 9:00 a.m. at the parking lot outside of Koji's place again, and left around 9:30. Stopped at exit 40 for breakfast again. Toshi, Masa, Koji and I sit at the same place that we sit last time.  This time, the weather looked good even the weather report said it would be rain.   When we arrived at Six Flags, not so many people were there which was good for us 'cause we didn't have to wait for long time to ride. And the weather was not bad at all, in fact, it started getting hot. The first ride that we went to was kind of scare for me. I was screaming all the way from the beginning to the end. The second one is the wood one, not so scare, but felt not so safe when we ride it. After a while, I got use to those scare ride, then start to enjoy it. Hahahaha, I was laughing when I ride.   We took a funny picture together, Koji has the picture right now. And, I will show you guys later after I get it. We went home around 4 - 5 p.m. Right after we left six flags, it started to rain. Really really really hard rain. We stopped at Ivy, had good dinner together.   Six Flags was nice!!!! I hope I could go again. Maybe I will go with Can or Lei!!!  ç»äºï¼å¨ææå¤©æåä¸ä¸ªæ¥æ¬æåå»äºSIX FLAGSãååï¼æä¸ç´é½æ³å»SFï¼ ä½æ¯ä¸ç´é½æ²¡ææºä¼ï¼å¨æ¯å ä¸ºå¤©æ°ï¼èæ¯ä¸é¨ãæ¬æ¥å¤©æ°é¢æ¥è¯´ææå¤©çæ¶åä¾ç¶ä¼ä¸é¨ï¼ä½æ¯æåKoJIé½è§å¾åºè¯¥æ²¡æä»ä¹é®é¢ï¼å ä¸ºåªæ¯è¯´é·éµé¨èå·²ãåºä¹ææçï¼ææå¤©çå¤©æ°å¥½å¾ä¸å¾äºï¼æä»¬å¨SFçæ¶åä¸ç¹é¨é½æ²¡æã  æä»¬å¨æ©ä¸ä¹ç¹åçæ¶ååºåï¼å¤§æ¦å¼äºä¸ä¸ªåå°æ¶ï¼ç»äºå°äºSFãå°çæ¶åå¹¶æ²¡æå¤ªå¤çäººï¼è¿æ ·å¾å¥½å¢ï¼å ä¸ºä¸ç¨æå¾é¿çéãæä»¥æä»¬å¨å¾ç­çæ¶é´éå°±å¯ä»¥åä¸é£äºææçç¿»æ»åè½¦ãç¬¬ä¸ä¸ªæè§å¾æææï¼å ä¸ºäººè¦åçè·ï¼ç¬¬äºä¸ªæ¯æ¨è´¨ç»æçï¼è½ç¶ä¸ä¼ç¿»æ»ï¼ä½æ¯æ²¡æå®å¨æï¼ä¾ç¶å¾ææãæä»¬åäºä¸ä¸ªåæ°´æå³ç³»çï¼ç»ææ¯æ¬¡é½æ¯å¨æ¹¿ï¼ï¼ï¼æå¼å§è¿è§å¾å¾ææï¼å¿çååè¿è®å¤§çãå¯æ¯å°åæ¥ï¼æå°±ä¹ æ¯äºãç©å¾å¾é«å´å¦ï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼  å¤§æ¦å¨ä¸å4ï¼5ç¹çæ¶åï¼æä»¬å°±ç»æäºææçæ¸¸ä¹è®¾æ½ãåå®¶çæ¶åå¼å§ä¸å¾å¤§å¾å¤§çé¨ï¼ï¼ï¼å¤§çåªè½å¼20MILEãæ¢æ¢å¼ï¼æ¢æ¢å¼ï¼ç»äºå¼å°NHï¼æä»¬å°±å°IVYå»åé¥­ã  å¯çæ¯å¾ç´¯çä¸å¤©ï¼ä½æ¯ççæ¯SUPER FUN!!!!

      Takayuki is going back to Japan. He needs someone take care of his tort. Toshi and I went to his house pick up the tortoise yesterday's afternoon. The tortoise is much bigger than those two tortoise which I use to have that died because I didn't give them enough food. I am happy to have another pet, but also afraid that I can't take care of him. Anyway, this tortoise had a name from I don't know who, maybe Tadayuki named him, which is "Savage-the-mother-fucker"!!!!!! What a name!!!!! After Toshi and I bought him home, we decided five him a new name. Toshi and I both like æä¸æ¥æ¨¹,and Toshi is reading a new book of his, which is called æµ·è¾¹ã®ã«ãã«ã So, we named him ã«ãã«ãHe is cute and aggressive. We went to Flushing today and bought some seafood for him. I think he likes it.

      I started work as a nail person. I don't know how you guys call the people who work in the nail salon. Anyway, the place I work is called The Simply Nail salon and Spa. It's 30 mins drive from Bridgeport on 95 North, and it is the same place that Toshi and Masa worked before. Toshi and Masa build that place with the Korean Boss. From him, I met all those wonderful Korean women, and they asked me to work with them. I didn't know anything about nail. So, I had to study from very basic, but I am a good student (kidding). Anyway, I started take customers from last week, and I only had three customers per day. However, we had very, very, very, very busy day yesterday. I walked in to the salon at 9:30 a.m, I had first customer after five mins, and then, none stop until 3:00 p.m. I had lunch for 20 mins, and none stop until 5:30 p.m. Oh! What a day!!! But, I had 10 customers!!! 10 customers are a lot because I have to spend around 45 mins for each customers. But, it was all good. Today was busy too!! Since it was busy yesterday, I felt ok today. ï¼PICTURE: Toshi, Masa and Korean Boss. Behide them is the nail salon which they was working on, and I am working now.

      Toshi, Masa and I went to picnic on Tuesday. They made riceballs in the early monring. We looked for a park which has a castle. It was a little bit far from Bridgeport,but it was ok. Tuesday was a raining day, but we still wanted to go. We took Lemon with us too. However, we had to leave Lemon in the car because she got so wild in the woods. When we just got there, it was still raining. We had to eat our riceballs inside of the house. There were around 10 young people who looked like teenagers, but they were drinking beers. After we ate our riceballs, we went to mountain climbing. And, we met a father with two daughters. Both of his daughters are so Cute!!! The younger one is really cute. We were climbing together, and they had a lot of fun with Toshi and Masa. Masa was so funny, and they called him the "Monkey-boy". Toshi had long talk with the father, and Masa and I just played with them. It was a good time. Those kids are too cute to grow up.   ä¸ä¸ªææäºï¼æï¼æåæ­£ä¸èµ·å»éçãä¸å¤§æ©ï¼æåæ­£å°±å¼å§åé¥­å¢ï¼åå¥½äºåæä»¬å°±åºåå»æä»¬çç®çå°ãå¼è½¦å¤§æ¦40åéçä¸ä¸ªå¬å­ï¼æä»¬è¿å¸¦çæ æª¬ä¸èµ·å»å¦ãå¯æï¼æ æª¬å°äºéå¤å°±å¼å§åçäºï¼å°å¤ä¹±è·ï¼æä»¬æå¥¹è·ä¸è§ï¼åªææå¥¹æ¾è¿è½¦å­éãåå°å¬å­çæ¶åè¿å¨ä¸é¨ï¼æä»¬å°±å»äºä¸ä¸ªåå±å­çäº­å­éï¼éé¢å¾å¤§ï¼èä¸æ10å¤ä¸ªäººå¨ãä»ä»¬å¼èµ·æ¥æºåé«ä¸­ççï¼ä½æ¯é½å¨åå¤éãæä»¬å°±å¨ç¦»ä»ä»¬æè¿çå°æ¹å¼å§åé¥­å¢ï¼è¿ä¸éãåå®åï¼æä»¬å³å®å»ç¬å±±ãå¨å»çéä¸­æä»¬éè§ä¸ä¸ªå¸¦çä¸¤ä¸ªå¥³å¿çç¶äº²ãé£ä¸¤ä¸ªå¥³å¿è¶çº§å¯ç±ï¼ç¹å«æ¯å°çé£ä¸ªãæä»¬å°±è¿æ ·ç¸éï¼ç¶åä¸èµ·ç¬å±±ãè®å¥½ç©çï¼å¥¹ä»¬å®å¨æ¯å¤ªå¯ç±äºã  urlLink     urlLink

      I really really don't like the owner of my house. He is always making problems for me. This time, he told me that I can't have Lemon in the living room and I have to keep her in my room. Well, there is nothing I can do. Bon is the one who told me that I can just let her stay in the living room, plus, I don't have enough place for her in my room. It's not just a place for Lemon. There was one time, he told me that I should move to first floor since I bought a lot of guys back, and most girls live on second floor!!! What!!! When did I bought a lot of guys back? And, there are three men live on second floor, but only two women!!!!! I am so upset of him! Maybe I will think about move to another place to live.  ä¸ææççæ¯è¶ç´è¨å­ãä»å¤©åå®¶ä¾ï¼æ¨ä¸peterèªªä¸ææä¸è®è²å¨å¤é¢è·ï¼è®ææ¾å°ææ¿éè£ãææ¿éé£éº½å°ï¼æéº½æ¾å¾ä¸è²ï¼å¶å¯¦ä¸åªè²æ¯æ²æåé¡çï¼ä½æ¯æåªè£æå°æ¹æ¾è²è²ç¨çä¾¿çãèä¸ç¶åæ¯å°é¦èªªå¯ä»¥æ¾å¨å®¢å»³åå»æ¿è£ï¼ææç­æå¹«ä»ç§çãå¯ç¾å¨ä¸ææå»èª¬ä¸å¯ä»¥ãä¸ææå¯¦å¨æ¯åå¾å¯æ¡çäººï¼ä¸æ¬¡å±ç¶è®ææ¬å°ä¸æ¨å»ï¼èªªä»éº½å ç²äºæ¨ä½çå¹¾ä¹é½æ¯å¥³çï¼æå¸¸å¸¶ç·çåä¾éå¤ãä»éº½å¦ï¼ï¼ï¼æä»éº½æåå¸¸å¸¶ç·çåä¾éå¤äºï¼èä¸äºæ¨é¤äºæä¹å¤å°±åªå©ä¸ä¸åå¥³çåå©åç·çï¼é£éº½å¹¾ä¹é½æ¯å¥³çï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼ç½ç¡ä¸ææï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼æ¨æ­»ä½ äºï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼

      Toshi went to macho club, and I was playing with my computer as usual. Masa called and asked if we wanna go fishing or not. That was a good idea. But Toshi didn't bring his cell phone with him, Masa and Tomoya went fishing first. After Toshi came back from macho club, we went to looking for them. It didn't take long to find them. They told us that they caught 5 fish already, but they sent them back to the sea. We changed to another place to fishing, but none of us caught anything. It was a relaxing time, a relaxing afternoon. æ¨å¤©ä¸ååä¸ä¸ªæåå»éé±¼ï¼æå¯¹éé±¼æ¯æ²¡æä»ä¹å´è¶£çï¼åªæ¯ä¸ºäºæåæ¶é´èå·²ãè®°å¾å°æ¶åä¼åç¸ç¸å¦å¦å»ä»ä¹éé±¼æä¹ç±»çï¼å¤§äººå¨ä¸è¾¹éé±¼ï¼ä¸è¾¹åè¿çæï¼ä¸è¾¹é²èãèæä¸è¬åæ¯è¢«ä¹¡åæ°æ¯æå¸å¼ï¼å¨ä¸è¾¹åæ³¥é³èèç©ï¼ç¶åå°±ç­å¾é£ä¸é¡¿ä¸é¦å­çé¥­ãæ¨å¤©çéé±¼æ²¡æä»ä¹ä¹¡åæ°æ¯ï¼æ³¥é³èèï¼ä¹æ²¡æä¸é¦å­ãåªæ¯å¾æ®æ®ééçèµ°å°æµ·è¾¹ï¼ç¶åå¼å§éé±¼ãæµ·è¾¹éé±¼çäººæºå¤ï¼å¯æå°é±¼çäººå´å¾å°ãä¸»è¦è¿æ¯æè§é£ä¸ªæ°æ°ç½¢äºï¼æµ·é£å¹å¨èº«ä¸å¾å·ï¼å³ä½¿æ¯å¨å­æåºçä¸åï¼ä¾ç¶éè¦ç©¿ä»¶å¤å¥ãæç»ï¼å ä¸ºåä¸äºåºéª¨çæµ·é£ï¼æ³è¿å¤å¤©çæ´»çæä»¬å°±æ¾å¼äºã urlLink    fishing urlLink

      Today was busy, I had 9 customers and didn't have anytime to relax for long. But, I did have a short period of time that nothing to do. I went to kitchen and ate some animal cookies. I don't know why, but while I was relaxing, I thought about my mom. There was one old time image came out of my mind which is I was eating something and my mom came out and told me don't eat snakes because we will have dinner soon. I felt so upset and depressed. I start to miss my parents. I am not that kind of girl who easy miss their parents, but I felt that the times that I miss my family is more than before. While I do nails for those ladies whose age are close to my mom or grandmother, I will miss them. While I think about all those Korean co-works who are nice to me and have children close to my age, I will miss my parents. I do miss them, I think. Haven't leave with them or spend any quality time with them in 6 years. I should shame on myself for whatever I did to make my parents sad or disappointed. After all, I am their only child and they love me deeply and truly. I love them too, but it just hard for me to tell them. I hope I can see them soon, and best wishes for them. ( The picture: I was only 15. I looked so stupid, but look at my family, we were all happy. I haven't see any of us have that kind of smile together for long time. I miss my happy family.)  ä»å¤©å·¥ä½å¾å¿ï¼å¾å¤å®¢äººãæé½æ²¡æä»ä¹æ¶é´å¯ä»¥ä¼æ¯ãä¸è¿ï¼è¿å¥½çæ¯æé£ä¹ä¸ç¹ç¹ãå¨é£ä¸ç¹ç¹çæ¶é´éï¼æå°±å»å¨æ¿åç¹é¥¼å¹²ãä¸ä¸ªäººåå¨å¨æ¿çæ¤å­ä¸ï¼åçé¥¼å¹²ï¼ä¸ç¥éä¸ºä»ä¹å¿½ç¶æ³èµ·äºå¨å½åçä¸å¹ï¼æå¨åçé¶é£ï¼å¦å¦ä»æ¿é´éèµ°åºæ¥è¯´ï¼âé©¬ä¸å°±è¦åé¥­äºï¼ä½ è¿åé¶é£ãâå¿½ç¶ä¸ä¸ï¼æè§å¾å¾ä¼¤æï¼å¿éæç§è¯´ä¸åºæ¥çæ»å³ï¼æ¯ä¸æ¯å¯å¯ï¼æä¹ä¸ç¥éãå¼è½¦åå®¶çæ¶åä¹ä¸æ ·ï¼å¼çå¼çï¼å¿½ç¶æ³å®¶ï¼ç»å¹´é¾ååä¸­èå¹´çå®¢äººç¾ç²æ¶ä¼æ³èµ·å¦å¦åå¥¶å¥¶ï¼çè§é£äºå¯¹æå¾å¥½ï¼å­©å­åæå·®ä¸å¤å¤§çé©å½é¿å§¨æ¶ï¼ä¹ä¼æ³å®¶ãææ¶è§å¾æé£äºå®¶å¨ç¾å½çæåçå¥½ï¼åå°å®¶éï¼ç¸ç¸å¦å¦åå¼å§å¦¹é½å¨ãä¸åæä»¬ï¼å­¤ç¬çä¸ä¸ªäººãæä¸æ¯ä¸ä¸ªå¾å®¹ææ³å®¶çäººï¼å¯æ¯è¿ä¸å¹´æ¥æ³å®¶çæ¬¡æ°æ¯åæ¥å¤äºãä¸ç¥éæ¯ä¸æ¯å ä¸ºæèäºï¼æèªå·±ææ¶åçä¸ºèªå·±æå°ç¾è»ï¼è¾è´äºç¶æ¯é£ä¹å¤çç±åå¥½å¿ãæ¯ç«ææ¯ä»ä»¬å¯ä¸çå­©å­ï¼ä»ä»¬å¯¹æçç±æ¯æ¯«æ ä¿çå¹¶æ²¡æç®ççãå¸ææä¸ä¼åè¾è´ä»ä»¬ï¼ä¹å¸æè½å¤æ©ç¹è§å°ä»ä»¬ãç¥ä»ä»¬èº«ä½å¥åº·ï¼å¿«ä¹ï¼å¹³å®ãï¼ç§çï¼æå¤§æ¦15å²å§ï¼çèµ·æ¥åä¸ªç·å­©å­ï¼å»å»ç~ï¼ä¸è¿æå¾åæ¬¢è¿å¼ ç§çï¼å ä¸ºæä»¬ä¸å®¶äººå¨ç§çä¸­çé£ä¸­ç¬å®¹ï¼æå·²ç»å¾ä¹æ²¡æçè§è¿äºãå¿«ä¹ç¾æ»¡çå®¶åº­æ¯ææåå¾çï¼æç±æå®¶å¦ï¼ï¼ urlLink     urlLink

      Toshi and I went to NY today. We parked the car in Flushing as always, then went to eat breakfast. The place that we chose was really not good. We didn't like the food at all. Kind of feel wasted my money. Anyway, after that we went to Hong Kong market for change single bills to 25 cents(for parking). Right after we went out from Hong Kong market, we met Kayoko, Mari and Guoli. We were so surprised to see each other because Toshi and I thought Kayoko just went back to Japan, but she came back for summer classes. So fast!!! How long did she stayed in Japan? Maybe less than a month. After said bye to them, we took subway to Manhattan. On our way to Manhattan, Toshi met two old Japanese friends who were studying in UB. Toshi was so happy to see them and talk with them. They thought I am a Japanese as everybody does. After we got out of subway, we tried to looking for the Japanese bookstore. Even we went there once before, but none of us could remember where is that place. Then, Toshi went to talk with an Asian guy. I thought he is just a some Japanese who were walking on the street, and Toshi just wanted to ask him if he knows where is the bookstore. But, that guy is a Chinese guy study in UB, who can speak Japanese very well, and they met before. He was looking for the bookstore too, and he helped us fought it. We spend more than a hour in there, and I bought two books. After we left bookstore, Toshi took me to a place called Tribeca. Toshi thought there would be a lot of different stores because that's what books says. However, we walked more than 2 hours around there, and we didn't see anything good. The only thing over there is Chinatown. We got so tired and decided go to East Village. So, we took a Taxi to there because we were too tired!!! After we got there, we looked around, and walked around again!!!! Then, started our dinner in FIGHT. That was good dinner with two tired body. When we above to leave, Toshi met another Japanese person who was in the same high school as Toshi, and they talked a little bit. When we tried to go back to Flushing, it was around 10:00 p.m. We were really, really tired. Finally, we got Flushing and drunk some tea, then decided to go home. After we got in the car and tried to go home, Tadami called me. Guess what! He and Yoko were in the same parking lot with us, and they saw we were leaving, so they kind of followed us, but gave up soon. What a day!!!! We were in NY for 12 hours and we met 9 people!!!!! This is a small world after all!!! Anyway, today was hot, fun, tired and wired!   ä»å¤©åæä¸èµ·å»äºçº½çº¦ãæ©ä¸11ç¹è¿æä»¬å°±å°äºæ³æçï¼æè½¦åå¥½åå°±å»åä¸è¥¿ãæ¬æ¥æ³å»è¶é½ï¼å¯æ¯è¶é½æ²¡æå¼é¨ï¼æä»¬å°±å»äºç³æ½®ãæçå¤©åªï¼ï¼ï¼ç³æ½®çä¸è¥¿çæ¯ä¸æ¢æ­ç»´ï¼ï¼ï¼å®å¨æ¯ä¸å¥½åï¼æè§å¾æé£é±è±å¾å¤ªä¸å¼å¾äºãåå®é¥­åï¼æä»¬æç®å»é¦æ¸¯è¶å¸æ¢äºç¡¬å¸å¥½åè½¦ï¼æ¢äºåå¤©ææ¢äº4ç¾åèå·²ãåºäºé¦æ¸¯è¶å¸ååè½¦åºèµ°å»æ¶ï¼å¿½ç¶éè§äºKayoko, Mariåå½ç«ï¼æä»¬é½å¤§åä¸æï¼ï¼ï¼å ä¸ºKayokoæåæ¥æ¬ä¸ä¹ï¼æä¹é£ä¹å¿«å°±åæ¥äºãå¥¹è¯´å ä¸ºå¥¹è¦ä¸æåè¯¾ï¼é£ä¹å¤ªå¿«äºä¸ç¹ï¼å¥¹æ»å±åæ¥æ¬çæ¶é´å¯è½è¿ä¸å°ä¸ä¸ªæãåå«ä»ä»¬åï¼æä»¬å°±å³å®åå°éå»æ¼åé¡¿ï¼å¨è½¦ä¸ï¼æéè§äºä»çä¸¤ä¸ªæ¥æ¬èåï¼ä¸¤ä¸ªäººé½æ¯ä»UBæ¯ä¸çãå¶ä¸­ä¸ä¸ªç·çå¬è¯´ç°å¨å¨ç»é£ä¸ªå¨çº½çº¦æ£çéçæ¥æ¬çååç¿»è¯ãæéè§ä»ä»¬éå¸¸çé«å´ï¼æåè¯æè¯´é£ä¸ªç·çå¨UBçæ¥æ¬äººä¸­å£°èªå¾é«ãåºäºå°éï¼æä»¬å¨ç¬¬äºå¤§ééè¿å¾å¾ï¼å ä¸ºæ¾ä¸å°æä»¬æ³è¦å»çä¸å®¶æ¥æ¬ä¹¦åºãå¿½ç¶ï¼æå¼å§åä¸ä¸ªäºæ´²äººè¯´è¯ï¼æä¸å¼å§è¿ä»¥ä¸ºæåªæ¯æ¾ä¸ªä¸çèµ·æ¥åæ¥æ¬äººçäººé®é®çç¥ä¸ç¥éé£ä¸ªä¹¦åºå¨ä»ä¹å°æ¹ãç»æï¼é£ä¸ªäººå±ç¶æ¯å¨UBè¯»ä¹¦çä¸ä¸ªå¨æ¥æ¬é¿å¤§çä¸­å½äººï¼ä»ä»¬äºç¸è®¤è¯ãé£ä¸ªäººå°±å¸¦æä»¬å»äºé£å®¶ä¹¦åºï¼æä»¬å¨ä¹¦åºéå¾äºå·®ä¸å¤2ä¸ªå°æ¶ï¼æä¹°äºä¸¤æ¬ä¹¦ãäºæ¯æè¯´å¸¦æå»ä¸ä¸ªå«Tribecaçå°æ¹ï¼è¯´æ¯æ¥æ¬çæå¿ä¸æä»ç»ï¼æ¯ä¸ªå¾ä¸éçå°æ¹ãå¯æ¯ï¼æä»¬å¨é£ä¸ªåºåéè½¬äºå¿«ä¸¤ä¸ªå°æ¶å´ä»ä¹é½æ²¡æçè§ãä¸ç¥éæ¯ä¸æ¯æä»¬æ²¡ææ¾å°æ­£ç¡®çå°æ¹ï¼è¿æ¯æå¿ææä»¬ç»éªäºãæ»ä¹ï¼æä»¬æ¯ç´¯æ­»äºãäºæ¯å³å®å»East Villageåä¸è¥¿ãEast Villageæ¯ä¸ä¸ªå°åºçåå­ï¼å¨é£éæä¸æ¡ä¸é¨ä¹°æ¥æ¬é£ç©çè¡ï¼è¡è¾¹é½æ¯æ¥æ¬é¤é¦ãé£é¡¿é¥­åçè¿è®å¥½çï¼å°±æ¯æä»¬å¤ªç´¯äºãåå®é¥­åï¼æä»¬å°±å³å®è¿æ¯åæ³æççå¥½ãæ­£åå¤ç¦»å¼çæ¶åï¼æå¿½ç¶åéè§äºå¦ä¸ä¸ªæ¥æ¬æåï¼å¬è¯´æ¯åæ¥å¨ä¸ä¸ªé«ä¸­è¯»ä¹¦çæåãç»äºï¼æä»¬åå°äºæ³æçï¼å¨åå®¶ä¹é´ï¼åäºæ¯å°è¶ãå¼è½¦ç¦»å¼åè½¦åºçæ¶åï¼Tadamiå¿½ç¶æçµè¯æ¥ï¼åæ¥ä»åå¥³æåæ­£å¥½ä¹å¨é£ä¸ªåè½¦åºï¼çè§æä»¬çè½¦å¼åºå»ï¼å¿ç»æä»¬ææå¼ï¼å¯ææä»¬æ²¡çè§ãä»å¤©ä¸å¤©çæ¯å¾ç­ï¼å¾ç´¯ï¼å¾å¥æª urlLink     urlLink

      After working at simply nail salon, I found out simply is not simple at all. First, there are three owners which are all women. One of them controls most of power, one of them works very hard and another one of them is kind boss. However, when three of them together, there is a war!!! Personally, I like the kind boss one. She is a very kind woman. She doesn't talk a lot, maybe because her English is not so good. Besides those three owners, there are 6 women work there. One girl just came from Korea 2 months ago, one stays in America 8 years, one who is the best nail person in our salon and gonna get married next month, one is K_andy's mother, one is very very very funny and nice person and last one is me. I am basically is a outsider of those women because I am not Korean and can't understand what they are talking about, which is fine with me. Because of that, I knew there is something going on in the salon, but don't know what is it. However, I can guess. I think there is something about money, some of them start to notice that they are not paid fair. Well, I just guess, I don't really know. But, I know they are not really friendly with each other as other people thought. When I work there, I feel like back to High school, you know how those high school girls fight with each other, right? Yeah, just like that. Luckily, I am not Korean, and don't have to get into those things. I am really bad at deal with women. And luckily, they all like me a lot. I think I am good at make older people like me as a kid or something.   ç®åç¾å®¹é¢çæ¯ä¸ç®åå¦ï¼ï¼ï¼å·¥ä½äºå·®ä¸å¤ä¸ä¸ªæï¼åç°åæ¥ç®åå¾å¤æãé¦åå¦ï¼ç®åæ¯ç±ä¸ä¸ªå¥³èæ¿åèµå¼çãä¸ä¸ªäººåæåçæ§æ ¼ï¼ç¬¬ä¸ä¸ªå¥³èæ¿æçæå¤§çæå©ï¼æä¸ç¥éæ¯ä¸æ¯å ä¸ºå¥¹æèµçæå¤ä»ä¹çï¼ç¬¬äºä¸ªå¥³èæ¿æå¤å³çä¸ä¸ªï¼æ¯å¤©ä»æ©å°æåä¸ªä¸åï¼ç¬¬ä¸ä¸ªå¥³èæ¿æ¯æåè¯çï¼å¯¹äººéå¸¸ä¹å¥½ï¼å¯è½æ¯å ä¸ºè±è¯­ä¸å¥½èä¸å¸¸è¯´è¯ãå¯è¿ä¸ä¸ªå¥³èæ¿å¨ä¸èµ·çæ¶åå°±æ²¡æä»ä¹ç¹å«å¤ªå¹³çäºæåçäºãé¤äºä¸ä¸ªå¥³èæ¿ä¹å¤ï¼è¿æå­ä¸ªå·¥ä½äººåï¼ç¬¬ä¸ä¸ªæ¯åä»é©å½æ¥è¿æ²¡æä¸¤ä¸ªæçåæåé¾å¥³çï¼ä¸»ç®¡åè¸åç¾ç²ï¼ç¬¬äºä¸ªæ¯æ¥äºå«å¹´30å²çèèå§å§ï¼ç¬¬ä¸ä¸ªæ¯35å²ä¸ä¸ªæè¦ç»å©çæªå©å¦å¦ï¼ä¹æ¯åºéçç¾ç²é«æï¼ç¬¬åä¸ªæ¯é©å½å¥½æåk_andyçå¦å¦ï¼ç¬¬äºä¸ªæ¯è¶çº§æè¶£å¯¹äººè¶å¥½ççå¿é¿å§¨ï¼ç¬¬å­ä¸ªæ¯è¶çº§æ²¡æèµååç»éªçæãå¹¸å¥½æä¸æ¯é©å½äººï¼æä»¥ä¸ç¥éå¥¹ä»¬ä¹é´é£äºå¾å¿æè§çäºæãè½ç¶æå¬ä¸æå¥¹ä»¬å¹³æ¶é½åè¯´äºä»ä¹ï¼ä½éè¿æå¸¸å¨æ¥æ¬äººä¸­ææ¼çç»éªï¼å¥¹ä»¬è¯´è¯çåå®¹æå¯ä»¥çå°50%ãæä»¥æç¥éå¥¹ä»¬è³å°æ¯å ä¸ºå·¥ä½åå·¥åä¸åççäºææè¿ç»ï¼å ä¸ºå¤§å®¶é½æ¯é å°è´¹åé¥­çäººï¼æä»¥å®¢äººçå¤å°å°±å³å®äºå°è´¹çå¤å°ï¼æäºäººçå®¢äººå¤ä½å¶ä»äººçï¼å¶ä»äººå°±ææè§ãå¹¸å¥½å¦ï¼æä¸æ¯é©å½äººï¼ä¸ç¨è¿å¥é£äºåé«ä¸­å°å¥³ççåå­éï¼åªè¦åå¤´è¦å¹²å°±å¥½ï¼å°±å¥½ã

      Toshi, Sugi and I went to NJ and NY yesterday. We went to the Japanese market which is in NJ. We drove from CT to NJ, normally it only gonna take 1 hour more something, but there was HUGE traffic. It took us almost 2 hour to get there, but the driving was not too bad, three of us chat together while in traffic. The Japanese market is much bigger than I thought and it was nice that there is bookstores and little stuff stores around it. We went to eat first 'cause we were so hungry. The food was ok, and I had have better before. After that, we went to bookstore first. I didn't buy anything from the bookstore, but Sugi and Toshi bought some thing. Then we went to those little stores. All those stuff are cute, but I think I passed the age to buy those cute stuff. I mean I still like them a lot, but don't wanna buy them anymore. I wanna a Japanese futo, but futo over there are too expensive!! 300 dollars something!!! I can't afford it. I am too poor. Anyway, after all those things, we went to buy food. It was fun to look at all those Japanese products. Oh, we took those small pics. I remember that Tadayoshi told me there is the machine. I think we had fun. After that, we went to Flushing to eat hot pot. Flushing is just same as always. Hot pot was good, and we ate a lot!!!

We don't know why that she likes pupu in our bathroom, but we had to clean up every time. We thought she would stop pupu soon, but she didn't. And, she start to yell a lot, kind of like crying. Finally, we decided take her to doctor. Then day we went to see the doctor was raining, and on our way to there, she pupued IN MY CAR!!!! That was so kusaii!!! Toshi and I almost dead because of it. After we got there, doctor exam her ears, eyes, and teeth. And he cut her nail, gave us some pills. Lemo was so afraid over there, she lost a lot of hair.

       Toshi washed out my contact lenses last night!!(Cry) That's my only pair!!! I went to Wal-markt this morning for a new pair of contact lenses. I thought I could get a new pair just right there, but they have to order from somewhere and it takes 5 days!!!FIVE DAY!!! That means I have to wear glasses for 5 days!!! I don't wanna!!!! I look so ugly with glasses!!! But, what can I do. They told me that they have to order a special kind contact lenses because my they told me that my left eyes shape look like a football and it need some special kind contact lenses. Well, 5 days without contact lenses shouldn't be so hard! Huh.. Can't go waterpark before I get thecontact lenses. I amso not lucky withall those park thing.    æ¨æï¼æçéå½¢ç¼éè¢«æç»æ´æäºï¼ï¼ï¼é£æ¯æå¯ä¸çä¸ä»ï¼å¥½ä¼¤å¿ï¼ä»å¤©ä¸å¤§æ©æå°±å»ä¹°éå½¢ç¼éãæ¬æ¥ä»¥ä¸ºæ²¡æä»ä¹ç¹å«çè¦æ±ï¼å½åºå°±å¯ä»¥æ¿å°ãç»æï¼ï¼æå±ç¶è¦ç­ä¸5å¤©ï¼æçå¤©å¦ï¼5å¤©å¢ï¼è¿5å¤©æé½è¦å¸¦ç¼éæå¯ä»¥ãå¯æ¯ï¼è¿ä¸åé½æ¯æèªå·±çéï¼è°å«æèªå·±å°æ¶åæ²¡æå¥½å¥½ä¿æ¤ç¼çï¼ç°å¨å´éè¦é«ç§æçæ¶æè¿æ¥å­ãå¯è½äººé½æ¯è¿æ ·ï¼æ¥æçæ¶åè§å¾å¤±å»äºä¹æ æè°ï¼ç»æå¤±å»äºï¼æç¥éåæ¥å¥½å¹¸ç¦ãä¸è¿æä¹è¯´ï¼è¿5å¤©é½å¿é¡»æä¸ºä¸å°é¸­ï¼ç­å°éå½¢ç¼éæ¥äºåï¼å¨åæå¤©é¹å¥½äºã

      Shishamocry for Lemo!! urlLink      urlLink     WE FOUND LEMO!!!!!! After watch the movie  The Catwoman,  we decide look for lemo again. And, Toshi suggested that we should go to the first floor, maybe lemo is in first floor. We went there, and didn't see her. We start to yelling her name, then we heard her yelling sound. But, where is her??? We kept look for her for long long time and room by room, but still she was no where to find. Then, the guy who live in the first floor said maybe she is in basement. I went to basement while yelling her name. Lemo's yelling sound became louder and louder. Finally!!!!! We found her in the basement. Can you believe it? She stayed in the basement without food and water for seven days!!!!! She looks lose the weight and hungry. We gave her food and she just couldn't stop eating. Poor Lemo!!!!! Toshi and I are so happy to find her, and she looks fine. Thank GOD for that.   Lemo!!! Don't leave again!!!

      Masa's girlfriend, Yayoi, is here now. She is a cute girl who looks kind too. Masa took her to NY yesterday, and Toshi and I went there met them later. When we met them, they looked tried. They spend whole day walking in NY and visit this big apple. We went to couple places together, and Masa decided go empire State Building. That was kind of late, around 8 p.m. Toshi and I decided go tothe Japanese Barrestaurant "Fight"first."Fight" is always busy even that day wasn't weekend. We had to wait for around 30 mins to have site. Whilewe was waiting,I made a cotton ball.Hahaha, kind of childlike, but it's ok. When we had site, we ordered seaweed salad and Edamame first. We were wondering if Masa could make it to ESB and "Fight", but we didn't wait for long. Masa and Yayoi camewith asad face because they had to wait for 2 hoursif they wanna go to thetop of ESB. They just gave up. We spend3 hours in the "Fight" and talked about all kinds of stuff. That was good time. On the way back to Flushing, I was so triedin the subway. But, once when I got in my car, I was awake.There wasn'tmany cars on the high way. We only use 45 mins to get home, and Masa and Yayoi weresleeping in my car (well, everybody does).  urlLink      urlLink

Toshiasked. "Sure." Then, Toshi went to pick up sugi while I was cooking hot pot.Hot pot iseasy to cook, and you don't reallyneed a lot of other food togo with it. So, we just waited for 30 mins for preparing.Oh! The hot pot was so hot andspicy evenfor me. We were enjoy hot in late night ( around 2:00 in the morning). That was really good for some reason. We really liked it and happy about it.  urlLink      urlLink    ææä¸ï¼åå¤å©é»ãæåæå¨çæåä¸æ¬¡å»æ³æçåç«éçéåæï¼ä¸è´èªåèå­é¤ãæ¼æ¯æå°±èªªè¦ä¸è¦ç¾å¨åç«éï¼æèªªå¥½å¢ï¼æé»è©±å«å±±ä¸èµ·ä¾ãæéè»å»æ¥å±±ï¼æå°±æºåç«éï¼ç«éå¾ç°¡å®ï¼ç°¡ç°¡å®å®çåçè©±ãå¤§æ¦åªç¨äºååå°æå°±æºåå¥½äºãä¸åäººéçé»è¦éåç«éï¼ç«éè¶ç´è¾£ï¼ï¼ççï¼æé½è¦ºå¾è¶ç´è¾£ï¼åçæåæ±æµä¸æ­¢çãååï¼ä¸éççæ¯å¾enjoyçä¸ä»¶äºå¦ï¼ä¸æ¬¡ææ©æï¼åä¾ä¸æ¬¡å¦ã

      We supposed wait for Masa and Yayoi to go water park too. But, they couldn't make it. Toshi and I decided to go by ourselves. We went to Six Flags' water park. It is kind of big inside. It was expensive!!! We spent $79.50 for tickes, and the locker spent us $12!!! We only brought $100 with us, and we had nothing left after that. That day was hot, which was good. We went to all those water rides. Most of them were fun, but kind of short. I wish they were longer. It was really good to see all those good looking people and cute kids. I haven't go to any water park for a long time. It was really fun. I wanna go again with more people next summer!!! urlLink     urlLink

        Masa and Toshi    urlLink     urlLink    Today! Masa, Kuni, Toshi and I went to Misquamicut Beach in RI. Toshi and I got up around 8 a.m. Masa came to our place around 8:30 a.m. for cooking the rice ball. I cooked one cold dish, corn and washed cherry. Kuni supposed to come at 8:30 a.m. too, but he didn't show up. We were wondering if Kuni still would go or not. Toshi went to Orange to check on Kuni, and came back without him. We thought Kuni not able to go anymore. However, maybe 15 mins later, Kuni called Masa and he was coming. We left our place around 10:30 a.m., which was 1 hour and 30 mins late than we planed.  The high way traffic was so bad!!! I really don't like CT 95, it also traffic. It took a long time to get the Misquamicut Beach. When we arrived, it was already around 1:00. The beach was good!!! So many people around!! We found a good spot very soon. When we put all our stuff in order, Toshi and I went to the ocean first. The water was cold!!!! We just stayed in water for a little bit, then came up and ate lunch. Lunch was good too!!! After that, everybody went into water. Toshi rent a boogie board and we went into water with it. I didn't really play because I was kind of afraid. The waves were strong sometimes. I was KO by a huge wave, and my left army got hurt by the sand. It wasn't too bad. I didn't play for too long, but Masa, Kuni and Toshi did. It was really good time that we spend on the beach!! We video typed fun things and took pictures.  It was fun!!! Fun, fun, fun.

      Masa took us (Toshi, Taiji, Nozomi, Kuni and I) to Norwalk last night. We thought there was a shops, but the shops was already closed when we got there. The only thing left was a who-knows-who-they-are rock ban, which was singing so hard. On the side of street, there were so many bars and cute shops. Toshi and I went to buy some food and stopped by a really cute shop. Because we were eating, we didn't went in. After we finished the food, that shop was already closed!! It wasn't so much fun over there, but it is always good to take a night walk during the summer night.  urlLink     urlLink
