      So I just got home from work... and blah.. its honestly been a long ass day. I should be asleep because I do have to get up at like 630am or 7am and be out of the house by 730am :( Why is my remote so damn early.. then I have my air shift from 2-6pm :( blah ah well... I just cant really sleep tonight I guess. Jen isnt here, she is in PA visiting nick which is awesome but its hard now to sleep alone. She hasnt been gone 24 hours and I miss her like crazy already... its kinda scary to be home alone though. Its the first time since we moved in together that I had to stay home here alone for the weekend. :0/ alrighty.. well its time for me to try and find some dinner and try and get to bed.ugghh

      So I decided to start another online journal. Why? Well, I'm not quite sure. I took a long break from the internet journal for a while. Just needed to take a break fromit I guess. So, out with the old and in with the new so they say.   Jen and I wake up around I guess 10ish, chilled out and made some kick ass breakfast together. She cooked up the omlettes and I cooked up the diced potatoes. Nothing like a good breakfast in the morning with the girly. :) She got ready for her trip out to PA. I just decided that I was gonna be a bum :) After she was on her way I got into the shower and got cleaned then put some laundry in the wash and decided to start my bumness :) Doing the laundry and just chilling around the house before I have to leave for work tonight. Arg.. I know its gonna be busy as hell tonight too. People are gonna try and take some spot out of their stopsets and throw them into mine when mine are actually filled out too! I dont think im gonna have much of a show tonight.   So, it's Friday (finally), I just got done playing some guitar.Its honestly been just way to long sinceI've played. I just honestly haven't had the time to pick it up and startgetting some songs together. Work is kinda kickin mein the assright now since issummer and its the seasonofhell. :) I feltlikeI've been working 7days a week for almost the whole month... hmm.. wait a minute.. I HAVE been working 7 days a week!! haha :-/ Ah well, Im getting extra money which I honestly can't complain about. I really need the money right now. *random mental note: I hate it whena person gets online and sends you and IM, strikes up a conversation and then says, "sorry but i gotta get going i'll be back in 15 mins." Why the hell did you IM me knowing that you werent gonna be able to talk? blah.. *   I think Im gonna end this post. Not much left to say right now.
