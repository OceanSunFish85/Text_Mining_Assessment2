       7.31.04  Last night I did something I have always wanted to do â I played in the rain.  When we left the club, it was pouring outside.  We sort of looked at it and I said, âyou wanna do it?â with a huge smile on my face.  The four of us looked at each other and all agreedâ¦definitely!    It was an amazing feeling â a little cold at first.  But, in 30 seconds, we were thoroughly wet.  I knew that my mascara had already begun to stream down my face, but I actually didnât care (this is  huge  for me).  I let my hair down, opened my arms and faced upwards to feel the rainâ¦mmm.  It was like something straight out of a movie.

       7.29.04  The other night when we were lying on your couch and I was gently petting Java it dawned on me: you are definitely a dog and I am definitely a cat.   You once asked me which of the two I would be. You said that we choose the animal we associate with and consider to have the same characteristics we have ourselves. But, I would argue that we choose the animal we wish we were more like because we admire the way they are. We enjoy their style and company and like the energy we receive.   I had a tough time answering your question because immediately I wanted to respond, âdefinitely a dog!â A dog because I love them, I love their high energy and affectionate nature. I love their free-spiritedness and their âsocial butterflyâ behavior. They require a lot of attention and physical interaction/exercise. They encourage me to be more active and loving simply because I have to take them for walks or runs and also cuddle and pet them a lot. Dogs are so smart. I love that they can be independent about some things like going outside (if they have a doggie door) and communicating to me when itâs time to eat. But, I also love that they still need me to take care of them. They still need me to nurture themâ¦.   The #1 thing I love about dogs is their innocence and ability to love unconditionallyâ¦   Now â a cat. Granted â I donât know too much about them, but I see that cats are way more independent and much colder than dogs. The cat can love its owner, but doesnât show it as much â they are not very affectionate by nature (cats in general â Java is definitely a rare case). They are very quiet and non-disruptive. Also, they are very elegant, careful and graceful creatures. Despite their low level of physical activity, they remain quite agile.  Considering this, I realize that I gravitate toward dogs because they have what I like and want. The way they are is how I wish I could be more like. I am attracted to dogs. However, my personality and actions are more like that of a cat.  I donât see you as a cat â definitely a dog. You have that energy I like. You are more affectionate. You are free-spirited and have the âsocial-butterflyâ behavior. You require more physical attention. You are so smartâ¦ Youâre the dog I want to nurtureâ¦.  And, the dog that I wish had my #1 favorite quality.

       7.28.04      âJay,â  I wish I had that voice messaging service that allows me to send a voice mail without calling. I want to respond to your e-mails, but not in writing anymore. I want you to  hea r me say these things. I want you to sense the sincerity in my voice. I donât want to call and have a conversation with you, not only because I donât want to bother you, but also because I donât want to be interrupted nor have it turn into an argument.  There are things I want to clarify. Starting with when it was that I did âcheatâ â I wasnât very clear in my âDear âJayââ entry. It wasnât while you were in DC/NY. What I did do while you were there was solicit company to go out, but I was very clear to him that I did not want to get physical â because I was with someone. You and I have had a lot of on-and-off periods in our relationship and I âcheatedâ while we were off. However, I donât consider that cheating. I thought we were over.  Another thing I want to clarify is why I donât say that I want a âhusband.â You should know by now that I am pretty politically correct - at least I try to be. When I speak, I like to use terms that are open for variation/interpretation - I donât like to get into specifics. Plus, saying âone day, when I get marriedâ¦â or âin the future, my husbandâ¦â is so clichÃ©! They imply that you are living your life by societyâs standardsâ¦ugh! This excerpt from my last fast-write will give you a better idea of what I mean:   Do you know why I am afraid to use the term âhusband?â Itâs because, to some men there is a certain sense of âbaggageâ attached to this concept. I choose to use the term âlife partnerâ because itâs a general term, under which âhusbandâ falls. I have noticed that many couples â the men, especially have problems making the transition from âboyfriendâ to âhusbandâ regardless of how long they have been with their significant other, and even if they have already been living like a married couple. There is something implied in this term that can make men flip-out and become scared that they are trapped with no way out. Because I am sensitive to this idea, and I still want a life partner, or husband, I opt not to scare away the man that I want to be with by potentially putting a negative idea in his head.    Soâ¦ That answers one of the questions in your e-mail. Well, technically it wasnât a question, but something you stated that I felt I needed to shed some light on.  You mentioned in one of your e-mails that you didnât know what I wanted from you. Well, what I did  not want was to play the role that âJaneâ played in your relationship with her. I did not want only part of you. I wanted all of you â the same love, respect and commitment that I was willing to give you â I wanted it in return. How could you be annoyed that I was so insecure about us when I knew how your last relationship was? What makes you believe that I wouldnât think youâd do the same to me? It has nothing to do with how confident I am in myself (i.e. that Iâm special enough that you wonât want to go astray). It is all about you. What you are ready and willing to give.  Again, something I wish I could tell you verbally is that I felt lousy after bumping into you outside the State Theatre. I know that you are angry with me and that I probably deserve it. But, I just want to tell you that it hurt me.    Believe it or not, I had my first crying spell last night. My very first since Iâve known you. All of the other times weâve fought and had our âoffâ periods I always psyched myself into thinking that it was for the best. That it just wasnât âmeant to be.â No matter how drawn I felt to you. Hence, my comment in my previous e-mail to you about struggling with the concept of âmeant to be.â I kept convincing myself that we werenât, but I felt like we were. Anyway, it was this way of thinking that never allowed me to shed a tear. They just wouldnât come out, even if I wanted them to.

       7.27.04   Iâm sitting here at my desk at the office, thinking about the kind of cake I want to make for"Peter's" welcome home party. I decided to go to the Food Network website for ideas and as I open the page, there is an image of a childâs school lunch: a paper bag with a sandwich, a glass of milk, a red apple and some oatmeal cookies. The heading that accompanies it says âBack to School: Make better lunches and snacks.â (Sigh)â¦itâs things like this that remind me that somewhere deep down inside, buried under my pride, and behind the faÃ§ade Iâve created over the past 2 years, that some day I really want to be a wife and mother.   Itâs almost like hypnosis. When I am completely alert and not under the influence of any substances or feelings of vulnerability, I can put on my daily âface.â That face Iâve been wearing since I jumped into the dating scene, just over 2 years ago. When I see, hear or feel something that âhypnotizesâ me and takes me into my subconscious, I realize what I truly want. Itâs something that I have always wanted â I guess Iâve always known! But, I seem to keep forgetting. Purposely? What am I trying to hide? The real me? Am I too afraid to say that I want to have a husband and kids someday? Perhaps. Rather than say, âI donât want this kind of life,â or âIâm not sure that I want this kind of life,â why canât I just say, âI want this kind of life, but Iâm not ready for it right now.â   My state of âhypnosisâ can also be triggered by something I hear. Yesterday it was triggered by an e-mail (well, actually something I read). After telling him that I  am  capable of falling in love and want to do so very badly, "Jay" said to me:     you may say this now (about love), but almost everything you tell me, and your actions show a person who protects herself at every turnâ¦rarely shows her true feelings (your writing vs. what comes out of your mouth)... is more insecure than romantic (needs a couple glasses of wine to begin showing affection) and has been so for so long, that she doesn't even want to announce "I want a husband I'm madly in love with".   instead, you take the stance, "i want a 'partner' (a business arrangement)and I recognize there will be downtimes in which i may cheat"   ok, so maybe not those exact words, but you know what i mean.   finally, rest assured my impression of you is of someone who wants love, but has no interest in risking it all for love. i.e. won't be open enough to let it happen.     Heâs right. Heâs not the first person to notice and point-out to me that I need âa couple of glasses of wine to begin showing affection.â"Peter" called me out on this as well. However,"Jay" is the first to capture my reasons for acting how I do. Also, he is the first to help me reach that level in my subconscious that allows me to see me â the real me. The one who knows what I want. The one who has always known. On our first date he told me that I desperately wanted to have kids. My initial reaction was that of pure shock. I thought to myself, â(gasp!) How chauvinistic of him to think that I want what just about every other twenty-something year old woman wants.â Only after spending more time with him, growing to like him very much and seeing him as an incredible candidate for a husband and father, did I realize he was absolutely right.   Do you know why I am afraid to use the term âhusband?â Itâs because, to some men there is a certain sense of âbaggageâ attached to this concept. I choose to use the term âlife partnerâ because itâs a general term, under which âhusbandâ falls. I have noticed that many couples â the men, especially have problems making the transition from âboyfriendâ to âhusbandâ regardless of how long they have been with their significant other, and even if they have already been living like a married couple. There is something implied in this term that can make men flip-out and become scared that they are trapped with no way out. Because I am sensitive to this idea, and I still want a life partner, or husband, I opt not to scare away a man that I want to be with by potentially putting a negative idea in his head.   Iâve seen couples that have been together for what seems like an eternity â living together and having children. But, the minute they decide to make the relationship official (i.e get married) they donât work â as couple. Itâs purely psychological. I know this. I am prepared to deal with the psychology behind the idea of marriage. However, I canât convince a man of this. And, I donât want to lose the man I love and want to be with because he canât handle a label.   Being a woman, I can adapt. Women can become ready, while men need to already be there. I have made an agreement with myself that I would go along with whatever would make the relationship work â as long as I still get what I want out of it: a life partner to love and who will love me the same in return. If the man I love wants to get married, I will marry him. I will want to marry him equally as much. But, if the man I love is afraid of being labeled a âhusband,â but knows he wants to be with me, I will be with him, live with him and be committed to him as if we were in a marriage. I donât need a legal document to prove my love and commitment to a man. I donât need to change my name to prove this either. I just need the love and commitment â everything else is purely icing on the cake.   This being said, the only reason I would strongly encourage marriage is if kids fall into the equation. In my opinion, to raise happy children you need to bring them up in a healthy home environment. A healthy home consists of a situation where there is a mother figure and a father figure in a loving, committed relationship. Every child needs representation from both parents during his/her development, especially in their early years. Whether the child is a boy or a girl, having a mom and a dad is extremely instrumental in shaping their perceptions and future relationships when they become adults. The marriage part comes into play to provide the children with the concept of creating a family and a home in a traditional manner. It instills values of tradition and reinforces the ideas behind commitment. In a way, I see it somewhat as a promise that the parents make to their children that says to them that they are bound together and always will be.

       8.6.04  I purposely did not answer the last two questions in your e-mail. How can I? For all we know you might already be engaged to "Jane" (assuming she has made up her mind and is waiting for Monday to tell you). You might be engaged! Oh my God.  I will ask you this: assuming what you said in your e-mail regarding your feelings for me is true, are you ready to marry someone else? Are you ready to dive into marriage while you somewhat still have me in your heart? What are you doing, "Jay"?  All I can say is that before Tuesday, when you dropped this bomb, I may have been able to answer your questions. I wonât now.  We had a wonderful lunch today â as if nothing is going on. While I enjoyed it very much and felt like everything was back to ânormal,â I was still aware that itâs not. Every time my hand accidentally touched you at the table or when I bumped or rubbed-up against you in the kitchen, I couldnât help but tell myself that I wasnât allowed to do that and that I needed to be more careful. I donât want to keep feeling this way.  I need you to not call anymore. Please donât invite me out. As much as I would love to continue, I have to have a little self-respect. I canât place my fate in the hands of someone else (i.e. wait for "Jane" to decide whether or not I can have you back). Do you understand me? I want more than anything to be with you when youâre having a rough time, but this situation involves me and my feelings. I donât think itâs fair. I sincerely care about your happiness and that may very well be your marriage to her, but you have understand that this is one area I where I have only a biased opinion.

       8.4.04  "Jay,"  I wish I could tell you, âstay with meâ¦donât marry herâ¦I want you to be with meâ¦Iâll be your number oneâ¦I promise youâll be happier with meâ¦ Iâm  the one youâre supposed to be withâ¦â But, I canât.  I canât guarantee it.  No one can.  Itâs a risk we would both have to take.  I donât want to have to beg for you to stay with me. If you stay, itâs because you want to, not because I have asked you to.  All I know is that I am so hurt.   So  hurt. I donât want you to marry her.  I want you to be with me.  I want to continue the progress we were making.  Our relationship was finally starting to grow and I was so happy about it.  You are such a challenge for me and I for you, but I think we could do each other so much good as a result of it.  Iâm so torn between saying these things to you and simply not saying anything at all.  I wonder what good it will do.  It may just confuse you even more.  I just want you to do what you really want, whatever is going to make you happy and put your doubts to rest.     Last night was enjoyable, but also awkward.  Especially once we got back to your place.  I really didnât want to leave but I was trying to respect your commitment to the proposal.  As I was massaging your back, I was getting so turned on.  All I could think about was how badly I wanted to make love to youâ¦but wasnât allowed.  It really left a bad taste in my mouth.

       Check this out:       osÂ·cilÂ·late  (synonymous with vacillate)    1. To swing back and forth with a steady, uninterrupted rhythm. 2. To waver, as between conflicting opinions or courses of action; vacillate: âThe court has oscillated over the decades from more liberal to less, more conservative to less, depending upon who was president at the time of vacanciesâ (Gordon J. Humphrey). See Synonyms at   urlLink  swing   . 3. Physics. To vary between alternate extremes, usually within a definable period of time.       Ha! I  was  right...punk! ; )   (You may have been thinking of "gyrate")

       8.4.04    I know that itâs game over for me. Itâs just really hard to accept. It was over the minute "Jay" proposed to "Jane." Regardless, whether she says yes or no, I canât be with him. If she says yes, then obviously they will be together. If she says no, and he turns to me, I can't have it. I can't be the runner-up; second best; number 2.    Plus... I don't think that "Jay" would really settle for that, anyway.

       8.4.04  "Jay,"  I canât be sure that you are reading these. You may not be which is why as I write this I feel itâs safe to assume you wonât before your situation with "Jane" is finalized. Just as well because I want to stay on the sidelines for when you need me, rather than be more proactive by offering. The way I am approaching this is in a very neutral manner. Of course I have feelings regarding âUsâ, but my focus right now is You. I think you need to come to a conclusion  independent of anyone  (including me) but the two of you.  I will say this: I am not a stranger to playing this role. It reminds me a lot of the time when "Peter" wanted to leave for Brazil. Everyone would ask meâ well, what are you waiting for - donât you want to go with him? Donât you want to be with him?â The answer to these was, âof course!â But, the ball was not really in my court. I could have asked him to stay. I could have asked him to take me along. But, I didnât. I knew he wanted to do this on his own. So, I took a step back and focused on his happiness. I encouraged him to pursue his dream. It hurt me tremendously and once he was gone and I saw that he had no intentions of coming back, I wondered if I had made a mistake by not letting him know what I eventually wanted with us.  To this day, I continue to encourage every crazy idea he has, simply because I love him and all he needs from me is support â the kind his parents donât give him because they canât help but be his parents! Nowâ¦like I told you yesterday, I finally see "Peter" as just my friend. Heâs no longer that guy that might end up being my husband - I just don't feel it anymore. I have changed so much and my interest in men has changed. I needed to be with him to realize this.  I donât want to tell you what I feel for you. I donât want to tell you what I want from you. Right now it doesnât really matter. I do want to tell you, that I want you to be happy â whatever that means.

       8.1.04  Iâve never felt as chill as I do right now.  Iâve realized that this song by Shakira,  Antologia , the very first song I ever dedicated to you, has even more meaning and relevance to my feelings for you than it did back then. The verse I have highlighted below was always a little fuzzy to me â I wasnât sure I was interpreting the song correctly. But I think I get it now. Itâs like me talking to you...or, you saying this to me.    Antologia   = Anthology By Shakira  anthology [Ã¦n'Î¸ÉlÉdÊÄ±]noun(plural: -gies)    1. a collection of literary passages or works, esp. poems, by various authors 2. any printed collection of literary pieces, songs, works of art, etc.     Para amarte necesito una razÃ³n     y es difÃ­cil creer que no exista una mÃ¡s que este amor.    Sobra tanto dentro de este corazÃ³n    que a pesar de que dicen    que los aÃ±os son sabios    todavÃ­a se siente el dolor.        Porque todo el tiempo que pasÃ© junto a tÃ­      dejÃ³ tejido su hilo dentro de mÃ­.        Y aprendÃ­ a quitarle al tiempo los segundos    tÃº me hiciste ver el cielo aÃºn mÃ¡s profundo   junto a tÃ­ creo que aumentÃ© mas de tres kilos c   on tus tantos dulces besos repartidos    desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato    y fue por tÃ­ que aprendÃ­ a querer los gatos    despegaste del cemento mis zapatos    para escapar los dos volando un rato.       Pero olvidaste una final instrucciÃ³n    porque aÃºn no sÃ© como vivir sin tu amor.    Y descubrÃ­ lo que significa una rosa    me enseÃ±aste a decir mentiras piadosas    para poder verte a horas no adecuadas    y a reemplazar palabras por miradas       y fue por tÃ­ que escribÃ­ mÃ¡s de cien canciones    y hasta perdonÃ© tus equivocaciones    y conocÃ­ mas de mil formas de besar    y fue por ti que descubrÃ­ lo que es amar, lo que es amar.    lo que es amar, lo que es amar .

       This is another song.  I was singing along with the radio as I pulled into your driveway tonight.  I love the idea of "hanging by a moment." It's what I seem to be doing with you.
