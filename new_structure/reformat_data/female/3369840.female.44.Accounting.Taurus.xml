      The Buck Stops â¦ Where? Stop blaming your henchmen, Mr. President. By Fred Kaplan Posted Friday, May 14, 2004, at 2:41 PM PT      Not out of the loop after all?   And so it seems I, too, have misunderestimated the president. This past Wednesday, I wrote a column holding George W. Bush responsible for our recent disastersâthe torture at Abu Ghraib and the whole plethora of strategic errors in Iraq. My main argument was that Bush has placed too much trust, for far too long, in the judgment of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, despite his ceaseless string of bad judgments.  However, two news stories that have since come to my attentionâone that appeared on the same day, the other more than two months agoâsuggest not merely that Bush is guilty of "failing to recognize failure" (as my headline put it) but that he is directly culpable for the sins in question, no less so than his properly beleaguered defense chief.  The first story, written by Mark Matthews in the May 12 Baltimore Sun, quotes Secretary of State Colin Powellâon the recordâas saying Bush knew about the International Committee of the Red Cross reports that were filed many months ago about the savagery at the prison. Powell is quoted as saying:  We kept the president informed of the concerns that were raised by the ICRC and other international organizations as part of my regular briefings of the president, and advised him that we had to follow these issues, and when we got notes sent to us or reports sent to us â¦ we had to respond to them.  Powell adds that he, Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice kept Bush "fully informed of the concerns that were being expressed, not in specific details but in general terms." (Thanks to Joshua Micah Marshall, whose blog alerted me to the Sun story.)  So much for Rumsfeld's protective claim, at last week's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, that he had failed to bring the matter to the president's attention. No wonder Bush, in turn, rode out to the Pentagon and praised his servant-secretary for doing a "superb" job.  It's amazing, by the way, how Colin Powell seems to have scuttled his good-soldier routine altogether, criticizing his president at first quasi-anonymously (through Bob Woodward's new book), then through close aides (Wil Hylton's GQ article), and now straight up in the Baltimore Sun. One wonders when he'll go all the way and start making campaign appearances for John Kerry.  The second news story that heaves more burdens on the president comes from an NBC News broadcast by Jim Miklaszewski on March 2. Apparently, Bush had three opportunities, long before the war, to destroy a terrorist camp in northern Iraq run by Abu Musab Zarqawi, the al-Qaida associate who recently cut off the head of Nicholas Berg. But the White House decided not to carry out the attack because, as the story puts it:  [T]he administration feared [that] destroying the terrorist camp in Iraq could undercut its case for war against Saddam.  The implications of this are more shocking, in their way, than the news from Abu Ghraib. Bush promoted the invasion of Iraq as a vital battle in the war on terrorism, a continuation of our response to 9/11. Here was a chance to wipe out a high-ranking terrorist. And Bush didn't take advantage of it because doing so might also wipe out a rationale for invasion.  The story gets worse in its details. As far back as June 2002, U.S. intelligence reported that Zarqawi had set up a weapons lab at Kirma in northern Iraq that was capable of producing ricin and cyanide. The Pentagon drew up an attack plan involving cruise missiles and smart bombs. The White House turned it down. In October 2002, intelligence reported that Zarqawi was preparing to use his bio-weapons in Europe. The Pentagon drew up another attack plan. The White House again demurred. In January 2003, police in London arrested terrorist suspects connected to the camp. The Pentagon devised another attack plan. Again, the White House killed the plan, not Zarqawi.  When the war finally started in March, the camp was attacked early on. But by that time, Zarqawi and his followers had departed.  This camp was in the Kurdish enclave of Iraq. The U.S. military had been mounting airstrikes against various targets throughout Iraqâmainly air-defense sitesâfor the previous few years. It would not have been a major escalation to destroy this camp, especially after the war against al-Qaida in Afghanistan. The Kurds, whose autonomy had been shielded by U.S. air power since the end of the 1991 war, wouldn't have minded and could even have helped.  But the problem, from Bush's perspective, was that this was the only tangible evidence of terrorists in Iraq. Colin Powell even showed the location of the camp on a map during his famous Feb. 5 briefing at the U.N. Security Council. The camp was in an area of Iraq that Saddam didn't control. But never mind, it was something. To wipe it out ahead of time might lead some peopleâin Congress, the United Nations, and the American publicâto conclude that Saddam's links to terrorists were finished, that maybe the war wasn't necessary. So Bush let it be.   In the two years since the Pentagon's first attack plan, Zarqawi has been linked not just to Berg's execution but, according to NBC, 700 other killings in Iraq. If Bush had carried out that attack back in June 2002, the killings might not have happened. More: The case for war (as the White House feared) might not have seemed so compelling. Indeed, the war itself might not have happened.  One ambiguity does remain. The NBC story reported that "the White House" declined to carry out the airstrikes. Who was "the White House"? If it wasn't George W. Bushâif it was, say, Dick Cheneyâthen we crash into a very different conclusion: not that Bush was directly culpable, but that he was more out of touch than his most cynical critics have imagined. It's a tossup which is more disturbing: a president who passes up the chance to kill a top-level enemy in the war on terrorism for the sake of pursuing a reckless diversion in Iraqâor a president who leaves a government's most profound decision, the choice of war or peace, to his aides.

      THE GRAY ZONE by SEYMOUR M. HERSH How a secret Pentagon program came to Abu Ghraib. Issue of 2004-05-24 Posted 2004-05-15 The roots of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal lie not in the criminal inclinations of a few Army reservists but in a decision, approved last year by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to expand a highly secret operation, which had been focussed on the hunt for Al Qaeda, to the interrogation of prisoners in Iraq. Rumsfeldâs decision embittered the American intelligence community, damaged the effectiveness of Ã©lite combat units, and hurt Americaâs prospects in the war on terror.  According to interviews with several past and present American intelligence officials, the Pentagonâs operation, known inside the intelligence community by several code words, including Copper Green, encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq. A senior C.I.A. official, in confirming the details of this account last week, said that the operation stemmed from Rumsfeldâs long-standing desire to wrest control of Americaâs clandestine and paramilitary operations from the C.I.A.   Rumsfeld, during appearances last week before Congress to testify about Abu Ghraib, was precluded by law from explicitly mentioning highly secret matters in an unclassified session. But he conveyed the message that he was telling the public all that he knew about the story. He said, âAny suggestion that there is not a full, deep awareness of what has happened, and the damage it has done, I think, would be a misunderstanding.â The senior C.I.A. official, asked about Rumsfeldâs testimony and that of Stephen Cambone, his Under-Secretary for Intelligence, said, âSome people think you can bullshit anyone.â  The Abu Ghraib story began, in a sense, just weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks, with the American bombing of Afghanistan. Almost from the start, the Administrationâs search for Al Qaeda members in the war zone, and its worldwide search for terrorists, came up against major command-and-control problems. For example, combat forces that had Al Qaeda targets in sight had to obtain legal clearance before firing on them. On October 7th, the night the bombing began, an unmanned Predator aircraft tracked an automobile convoy that, American intelligence believed, contained Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A lawyer on duty at the United States Central Command headquarters, in Tampa, Florida, refused to authorize a strike. By the time an attack was approved, the target was out of reach. Rumsfeld was apoplectic over what he saw as a self-defeating hesitation to attack that was due to political correctness. One officer described him to me that fall as âkicking a lot of glass and breaking doors.â In November, the Washington Post reported that, as many as ten times since early October, Air Force pilots believed theyâd had senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members in their sights but had been unable to act in time because of legalistic hurdles. There were similar problems throughout the world, as American Special Forces units seeking to move quickly against suspected terrorist cells were compelled to get prior approval from local American ambassadors and brief their superiors in the chain of command.  Rumsfeld reacted in his usual direct fashion: he authorized the establishment of a highly secret program that was given blanket advance approval to kill or capture and, if possible, interrogate âhigh valueâ targets in the Bush Administrationâs war on terror. A special-access program, or sapâsubject to the Defense Departmentâs most stringent level of securityâwas set up, with an office in a secure area of the Pentagon. The program would recruit operatives and acquire the necessary equipment, including aircraft, and would keep its activities under wraps. Americaâs most successful intelligence operations during the Cold War had been saps, including the Navyâs submarine penetration of underwater cables used by the Soviet high command and construction of the Air Forceâs stealth bomber. All the so-called âblackâ programs had one element in common: the Secretary of Defense, or his deputy, had to conclude that the normal military classification restraints did not provide enough security.   âRumsfeldâs goal was to get a capability in place to take on a high-value targetâa standup group to hit quickly,â a former high-level intelligence official told me. âHe got all the agencies togetherâthe C.I.A. and the N.S.A.âto get pre-approval in place. Just say the code word and go.â The operation had across-the-board approval from Rumsfeld and from Condoleezza Rice, the national-security adviser. President Bush was informed of the existence of the program, the former intelligence official said.     The people assigned to the program worked by the book, the former intelligence official told me. They created code words, and recruited, after careful screening, highly trained commandos and operatives from Americaâs Ã©lite forcesâNavy seals, the Armyâs Delta Force, and the C.I.A.âs paramilitary experts. They also asked some basic questions: âDo the people working the problem have to use aliases? Yes. Do we need dead drops for the mail? Yes. No traceability and no budget. And some special-access programs are never fully briefed to Congress.â  In theory, the operation enabled the Bush Administration to respond immediately to time-sensitive intelligence: commandos crossed borders without visas and could interrogate terrorism suspects deemed too important for transfer to the militaryâs facilities at GuantÃ¡namo, Cuba. They carried out instant interrogationsâusing force if necessaryâat secret C.I.A. detention centers scattered around the world. The intelligence would be relayed to the sap command center in the Pentagon in real time, and sifted for those pieces of information critical to the âwhite,â or overt, world.  Fewer than two hundred operatives and officials, including Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were âcompletely read into the program,â the former intelligence official said. The goal was to keep the operation protected. âWeâre not going to read more people than necessary into our heart of darkness,â he said. âThe rules are âGrab whom you must. Do what you want.ââ  One Pentagon official who was deeply involved in the program was Stephen Cambone, who was named Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in March, 2003. The office was new; it was created as part of Rumsfeldâs reorganization of the Pentagon. Cambone was unpopular among military and civilian intelligence bureaucrats in the Pentagon, essentially because he had little experience in running intelligence programs, though in 1998 he had served as staff director for a committee, headed by Rumsfeld, that warned of an emerging ballistic-missile threat to the United States. He was known instead for his closeness to Rumsfeld. âRemember Henry IIââWho will rid me of this meddlesome priest?ââ the senior C.I.A. official said to me, with a laugh, last week. âWhatever Rumsfeld whimsically says, Cambone will do ten times that much.â  Cambone was a strong advocate for war against Iraq. He shared Rumsfeldâs disdain for the analysis and assessments proffered by the C.I.A., viewing them as too cautious, and chafed, as did Rumsfeld, at the C.I.A.âs inability, before the Iraq war, to state conclusively that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction. Camboneâs military assistant, Army Lieutenant General William G. (Jerry) Boykin, was also controversial. Last fall, he generated unwanted headlines after it was reported that, in a speech at an Oregon church, he equated the Muslim world with Satan.  Early in his tenure, Cambone provoked a bureaucratic battle within the Pentagon by insisting that he be given control of all special-access programs that were relevant to the war on terror. Those programs, which had been viewed by many in the Pentagon as sacrosanct, were monitored by Kenneth deGraffenreid, who had experience in counter-intelligence programs. Cambone got control, and deGraffenreid subsequently left the Pentagon. Asked for comment on this story, a Pentagon spokesman said, âI will not discuss any covert programs; however, Dr. Cambone did not assume his position as the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence until March 7, 2003, and had no involvement in the decision-making process regarding interrogation procedures in Iraq or anywhere else.â  In mid-2003, the special-access program was regarded in the Pentagon as one of the success stories of the war on terror. âIt was an active program,â the former intelligence official told me. âItâs been the most important capability we have for dealing with an imminent threat. If we discover where Osama bin Laden is, we can get him. And we can remove an existing threat with a real capability to hit the United Statesâand do so without visibility.â Some of its methods were troubling and could not bear close scrutiny, however.   By then, the war in Iraq had begun. The sap was involved in some assignments in Iraq, the former official said. C.I.A. and other American Special Forces operatives secretly teamed up to hunt for Saddam Hussein andâwithout successâfor Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. But they werenât able to stop the evolving insurgency.    In the first months after the fall of Baghdad, Rumsfeld and his aides still had a limited view of the insurgency, seeing it as little more than the work of Baathist âdead-enders,â criminal gangs, and foreign terrorists who were Al Qaeda followers. The Administration measured its success in the war by how many of those on its list of the fifty-five most wanted members of the old regimeâreproduced on playing cardsâhad been captured. Then, in August, 2003, terror bombings in Baghdad hit the Jordanian Embassy, killing nineteen people, and the United Nations headquarters, killing twenty-three people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the head of the U.N. mission. On August 25th, less than a week after the U.N. bombing, Rumsfeld acknowledged, in a talk before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, that âthe dead-enders are still with us.â He went on, âThere are some today who are surprised that there are still pockets of resistance in Iraq, and they suggest that this represents some sort of failure on the part of the Coalition. But this is not the case.â Rumsfeld compared the insurgents with those true believers who âfought on during and after the defeat of the Nazi regime in Germany.â A few weeks laterâand five months after the fall of Baghdadâthe Defense Secretary declared,âIt is, in my view, better to be dealing with terrorists in Iraq than in the United States.â  Inside the Pentagon, there was a growing realization that the war was going badly. The increasingly beleaguered and baffled Army leadership was telling reporters that the insurgents consisted of five thousand Baathists loyal to Saddam Hussein. âWhen you understand that theyâre organized in a cellular structure,â General John Abizaid, the head of the Central Command, declared, âthat . . . they have access to a lot of money and a lot of ammunition, youâll understand how dangerous they are.â  The American military and intelligence communities were having little success in penetrating the insurgency. One internal report prepared for the U.S. military, made available to me, concluded that the insurgentsââstrategic and operational intelligence has proven to be quite good.â According to the study:   Their ability to attack convoys, other vulnerable targets and particular individuals has been the result of painstaking surveillance and reconnaissance. Inside information has been passed on to insurgent cells about convoy/troop movements and daily habits of Iraqis working with coalition from within the Iraqi security services, primarily the Iraqi Police force which is rife with sympathy for the insurgents, Iraqi ministries and from within pro-insurgent individuals working with the CPAâs so-called Green Zone.    The study concluded, âPolitically, the U.S. has failed to date. Insurgencies can be fixed or ameliorated by dealing with what caused them in the first place. The disaster that is the reconstruction of Iraq has been the key cause of the insurgency. There is no legitimate government, and it behooves the Coalition Provisional Authority to absorb the sad but unvarnished fact that most Iraqis do not see the Governing Councilââthe Iraqi body appointed by the C.P.A.ââas the legitimate authority. Indeed, they know that the true power is the CPA.â  By the fall, a military analyst told me, the extent of the Pentagonâs political and military misjudgments was clear. Donald Rumsfeldâs âdead-endersâ now included not only Baathists but many marginal figures as wellâthugs and criminals who were among the tens of thousands of prisoners freed the previous fall by Saddam as part of a prewar general amnesty. Their desperation was not driving the insurgency; it simply made them easy recruits for those who were. The analyst said, âWeâd killed and captured guys who had been given two or three hundred dollars to âpray and sprayâââthat is, shoot randomly and hope for the best. âThey werenât really insurgents but down-and-outers who were paid by wealthy individuals sympathetic to the insurgency.â In many cases, the paymasters were Sunnis who had been members of the Baath Party. The analyst said that the insurgents âspent three or four months figuring out how we operated and developing their own countermeasures. If that meant putting up a hapless guy to go and attack a convoy and see how the American troops responded, theyâd do it.â Then, the analyst said, âthe clever ones began to get in on the action.â  By contrast, according to the military report, the American and Coalition forces knew little about the insurgency: âHuman intelligence is poor or lacking . . . due to the dearth of competence and expertise. . . . The intelligence effort is not coÃ¶rdinated since either too many groups are involved in gathering intelligence or the final product does not get to the troops in the field in a timely manner.â The success of the war was at risk; something had to be done to change the dynamic.     The solution, endorsed by Rumsfeld and carried out by Stephen Cambone, was to get tough with those Iraqis in the Army prison system who were suspected of being insurgents. A key player was Major General Geoffrey Miller, the commander of the detention and interrogation center at GuantÃ¡namo, who had been summoned to Baghdad in late August to review prison interrogation procedures. The internal Army report on the abuse charges, written by Major General Antonio Taguba in February, revealed that Miller urged that the commanders in Baghdad change policy and place military intelligence in charge of the prison. The report quoted Miller as recommending that âdetention operations must act as an enabler for interrogation.â  Millerâs concept, as it emerged in recent Senate hearings, was to âGitmoizeâ the prison system in Iraqâto make it more focussed on interrogation. He also briefed military commanders in Iraq on the interrogation methods used in Cubaâmethods that could, with special approval, include sleep deprivation, exposure to extremes of cold and heat, and placing prisoners in âstress positionsâ for agonizing lengths of time. (The Bush Administration had unilaterally declared Al Qaeda and other captured members of international terrorist networks to be illegal combatants, and not eligible for the protection of the Geneva Conventions.)   Rumsfeld and Cambone went a step further, however: they expanded the scope of the sap, bringing its unconventional methods to Abu Ghraib. The commandos were to operate in Iraq as they had in Afghanistan. The male prisoners could be treated roughly, and exposed to sexual humiliation.   âThey werenât getting anything substantive from the detainees in Iraq,â the former intelligence official told me. âNo names. Nothing that they could hang their hat on. Cambone says, Iâve got to crack this thing and Iâm tired of working through the normal chain of command. Iâve got this apparatus set upâthe black special-access programâand Iâm going in hot. So he pulls the switch, and the electricity begins flowing last summer. And itâs working. Weâre getting a picture of the insurgency in Iraq and the intelligence is flowing into the white world. Weâre getting good stuff. But weâve got more targetsââprisoners in Iraqi jailsââthan people who can handle them.â  Cambone then made another crucial decision, the former intelligence official told me: not only would he bring the sapâs rules into the prisons; he would bring some of the Army military-intelligence officers working inside the Iraqi prisons under the sapâs auspices. âSo here are fundamentally good soldiersâmilitary-intelligence guysâbeing told that no rules apply,â the former official, who has extensive knowledge of the special-access programs, added. âAnd, as far as theyâre concerned, this is a covert operation, and itâs to be kept within Defense Department channels.â  The military-police prison guards, the former official said, included ârecycled hillbillies from Cumberland, Maryland.â He was referring to members of the 372nd Military Police Company. Seven members of the company are now facing charges for their role in the abuse at Abu Ghraib. âHow are these guys from Cumberland going to know anything? The Army Reserve doesnât know what itâs doing.â  Who was in charge of Abu Ghraibâwhether military police or military intelligenceâwas no longer the only question that mattered. Hard-core special operatives, some of them with aliases, were working in the prison. The military police assigned to guard the prisoners wore uniforms, but many othersâmilitary intelligence officers, contract interpreters, C.I.A. officers, and the men from the special-access programâwore civilian clothes. It was not clear who was who, even to Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, then the commander of the 800th Military Police Brigade, and the officer ostensibly in charge. âI thought most of the civilians there were interpreters, but there were some civilians that I didnât know,â Karpinski told me. âI called them the disappearing ghosts. Iâd seen them once in a while at Abu Ghraib and then Iâd see them months later. They were niceâtheyâd always call out to me and say, âHey, remember me? How are you doing?ââ The mysterious civilians, she said, were âalways bringing in somebody for interrogation or waiting to collect somebody going out.â Karpinski added that she had no idea who was operating in her prison system. (General Taguba found that Karpinskiâs leadership failures contributed to the abuses.)  By fall, according to the former intelligence official, the senior leadership of the C.I.A. had had enough. âThey said, âNo way. We signed up for the core program in Afghanistanâpre-approved for operations against high-value terrorist targetsâand now you want to use it for cabdrivers, brothers-in-law, and people pulled off the streetsâââthe sort of prisoners who populate the Iraqi jails. âThe C.I.A.âs legal people objected,â and the agency ended its sap involvement in Abu Ghraib, the former official said.   The C.I.A.âs complaints were echoed throughout the intelligence community. There was fear that the situation at Abu Ghraib would lead to the exposure of the secret sap, and thereby bring an end to what had been, before Iraq, a valuable cover operation. âThis was stupidity,â a government consultant told me. âYouâre taking a program that was operating in the chaos of Afghanistan against Al Qaeda, a stateless terror group, and bringing it into a structured, traditional war zone. Sooner or later, the commandos would bump into the legal and moral procedures of a conventional war with an Army of a hundred and thirty-five thousand soldiers.â  The former senior intelligence official blamed hubris for the Abu Ghraib disaster. âThereâs nothing more exhilarating for a pissant Pentagon civilian than dealing with an important national security issue without dealing with military planners, who are always worried about risk,â he told me. âWhat could be more boring than needing the coÃ¶peration of logistical planners?â The only difficulty, the former official added, is that, âas soon as you enlarge the secret program beyond the oversight capability of experienced people, you lose control. Weâve never had a case where a special-access program went sourâand this goes back to the Cold War.â  In a separate interview, a Pentagon consultant, who spent much of his career directly involved with special-access programs, spread the blame. âThe White House subcontracted this to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon subcontracted it to Cambone,â he said. âThis is Camboneâs deal, but Rumsfeld and Myers approved the program.â When it came to the interrogation operation at Abu Ghraib, he said, Rumsfeld left the details to Cambone. Rumsfeld may not be personally culpable, the consultant added, âbut heâs responsible for the checks and balances. The issue is that, since 9/11, weâve changed the rules on how we deal with terrorism, and created conditions where the ends justify the means.â    Last week, statements made by one of the seven accused M.P.s, Specialist Jeremy Sivits, who is expected to plead guilty, were released. In them, he claimed that senior commanders in his unit would have stopped the abuse had they witnessed it. One of the questions that will be explored at any trial, however, is why a group of Army Reserve military policemen, most of them from small towns, tormented their prisoners as they did, in a manner that was especially humiliating for Iraqi men.   The notion that Arabs are particularly vulnerable to sexual humiliation became a talking point among pro-war Washington conservatives in the months before the March, 2003, invasion of Iraq. One book that was frequently cited was âThe Arab Mind,â a study of Arab culture and psychology, first published in 1973, by Raphael Patai, a cultural anthropologist who taught at, among other universities, Columbia and Princeton, and who died in 1996. The book includes a twenty-five-page chapter on Arabs and sex, depicting sex as a taboo vested with shame and repression. âThe segregation of the sexes, the veiling of the women . . . and all the other minute rules that govern and restrict contact between men and women, have the effect of making sex a prime mental preoccupation in the Arab world,â Patai wrote. Homosexual activity, âor any indication of homosexual leanings, as with all other expressions of sexuality, is never given any publicity. These are private affairs and remain in private.â The Patai book, an academic told me, was âthe bible of the neocons on Arab behavior.â In their discussions, he said, two themes emergedââone, that Arabs only understand force and, two, that the biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation.â  The government consultant said that there may have been a serious goal, in the beginning, behind the sexual humiliation and the posed photographs. It was thought that some prisoners would do anythingâincluding spying on their associatesâto avoid dissemination of the shameful photos to family and friends. The government consultant said, âI was told that the purpose of the photographs was to create an army of informants, people you could insert back in the population.â The idea was that they would be motivated by fear of exposure, and gather information about pending insurgency action, the consultant said. If so, it wasnât effective; the insurgency continued to grow.  âThis shit has been brewing for months,â the Pentagon consultant who has dealt with saps told me. âYou donât keep prisoners naked in their cell and then let them get bitten by dogs. This is sick.â The consultant explained that he and his colleagues, all of whom had served for years on active duty in the military, had been appalled by the misuse of Army guard dogs inside Abu Ghraib. âWe donât raise kids to do things like that. When you go after Mullah Omar, thatâs one thing. But when you give the authority to kids who donât know the rules, thatâs another.â  In 2003, Rumsfeldâs apparent disregard for the requirements of the Geneva Conventions while carrying out the war on terror had led a group of senior military legal officers from the Judge Advocate Generalâs (jag) Corps to pay two surprise visits within five months to Scott Horton, who was then chairman of the New York City Bar Associationâs Committee on International Human Rights. âThey wanted us to challenge the Bush Administration about its standards for detentions and interrogation,â Horton told me. âThey were urging us to get involved and speak in a very loud voice. It came pretty much out of the blue. The message was that conditions are ripe for abuse, and itâs going to occur.â The military officials were most alarmed about the growing use of civilian contractors in the interrogation process, Horton recalled. âThey said there was an atmosphere of legal ambiguity being created as a result of a policy decision at the highest levels in the Pentagon. The jag officers were being cut out of the policy formulation process.â They told him that, with the war on terror, a fifty-year history of exemplary application of the Geneva Conventions had come to an end.    The abuses at Abu Ghraib were exposed on January 13th, when Joseph Darby, a young military policeman assigned to Abu Ghraib, reported the wrongdoing to the Armyâs Criminal Investigations Division. He also turned over a CD full of photographs. Within three days, a report made its way to Donald Rumsfeld, who informed President Bush.   The inquiry presented a dilemma for the Pentagon. The C.I.D. had to be allowed to continue, the former intelligence official said. âYou canât cover it up. You have to prosecute these guys for being off the reservation. But how do you prosecute them when they were covered by the special-access program? So you hope that maybe itâll go away.â The Pentagonâs attitude last January, he said, was âSomebody got caught with some photos. Whatâs the big deal? Take care of it.â Rumsfeldâs explanation to the White House, the official added, was reassuring: ââWeâve got a glitch in the program. Weâll prosecute it.â The cover story was that some kids got out of control.â  In their testimony before Congress last week, Rumsfeld and Cambone struggled to convince the legislators that Millerâs visit to Baghdad in late August had nothing to do with the subsequent abuse. Cambone sought to assure the Senate Armed Services Committee that the interplay between Miller and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, had only a casual connection to his office. Millerâs recommendations, Cambone said, were made to Sanchez. His own role, he said, was mainly to insure that the âflow of intelligence back to the commandsâ was âefficient and effective.â He added that Millerâs goal was âto provide a safe, secure and humane environment that supports the expeditious collection of intelligence.â  It was a hard sell. Senator Hillary Clinton, Democrat of New York, posed the essential question facing the senators:   If, indeed, General Miller was sent from GuantÃ¡namo to Iraq for the purpose of acquiring more actionable intelligence from detainees, then it is fair to conclude that the actions that are at point here in your report [on abuses at Abu Ghraib] are in some way connected to General Millerâs arrival and his specific orders, however they were interpreted, by those MPs and the military intelligence that were involved.. . .Therefore, I for one donât believe I yet have adequate information from Mr. Cambone and the Defense Department as to exactly what General Millerâs orders were . . . how he carried out those orders, and the connection between his arrival in the fall of â03 and the intensity of the abuses that occurred afterward.    Sometime before the Abu Ghraib abuses became public, the former intelligence official told me, Miller was âread inââthat is, briefedâon the special-access operation. In April, Miller returned to Baghdad to assume control of the Iraqi prisons; once the scandal hit, with its glaring headlines, General Sanchez presented him to the American and international media as the general who would clean up the Iraqi prison system and instill respect for the Geneva Conventions. âHis job is to save what he can,â the former official said. âHeâs there to protect the program while limiting any loss of core capability.â As for Antonio Taguba, the former intelligence official added, âHe goes into it not knowing shit. And then: âHoly cow! Whatâs going on?ââ  If General Miller had been summoned by Congress to testify, he, like Rumsfeld and Cambone, would not have been able to mention the special-access program. âIf you give away the fact that a special-access program exists,âthe former intelligence official told me, âyou blow the whole quick-reaction program.â  One puzzling aspect of Rumsfeldâs account of his initial reaction to news of the Abu Ghraib investigation was his lack of alarm and lack of curiosity. One factor may have been recent history: there had been many previous complaints of prisoner abuse from organization like Human Rights Watch and the International Red Cross, and the Pentagon had weathered them with ease. Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he had not been provided with details of alleged abuses until late March, when he read the specific charges. âYou read it, as I say, itâs one thing. You see these photographs and itâs just unbelievable. . . . It wasnât three-dimensional. It wasnât video. It wasnât color. It was quite a different thing.â The former intelligence official said that, in his view, Rumsfeld and other senior Pentagon officials had not studied the photographs because âthey thought what was in there was permitted under the rules of engagement,â as applied to the sap. âThe photos,â he added, âturned out to be the result of the program run amok.â  The former intelligence official made it clear that he was not alleging that Rumsfeld or General Myers knew that atrocities were committed. But, he said, âit was their permission granted to do the sap, generically, and there was enough ambiguity, which permitted the abuses.â  This official went on, âThe black guysââthose in the Pentagonâs secret programââsay weâve got to accept the prosecution. Theyâre vaccinated from the reality.â The sap is still active, and âthe United States is picking up guys for interrogation. The question is, how do they protect the quick-reaction force without blowing its cover?â The program was protected by the fact that no one on the outside was allowed to know of its existence. âIf you even give a hint that youâre aware of a black program that youâre not read into, you lose your clearances,â the former official said. âNobody will talk. So the only people left to prosecute are those who are undefendedâthe poor kids at the end of the food chain.â  The most vulnerable senior official is Cambone. âThe Pentagon is trying now to protect Cambone, and doesnât know how to do it,â the former intelligence official said.    Last week, the government consultant, who has close ties to many conservatives, defended the Administrationâs continued secrecy about the special-access program in Abu Ghraib. âWhy keep it black?â the consultant asked. âBecause the process is unpleasant. Itâs like making sausageâyou like the result but you donât want to know how it was made. Also, you donât want the Iraqi public, and the Arab world, to know. Remember, we went to Iraq to democratize the Middle East. The last thing you want to do is let the Arab world know how you treat Arab males in prison.â  The former intelligence official told me he feared that one of the disastrous effects of the prison-abuse scandal would be the undermining of legitimate operations in the war on terror, which had already suffered from the draining of resources into Iraq. He portrayed Abu Ghraib as âa tumorâ on the war on terror. He said, âAs long as itâs benign and contained, the Pentagon can deal with the photo crisis without jeopardizing the secret program. As soon as it begins to grow, with nobody to diagnose itâit becomes a malignant tumor.â  The Pentagon consultant made a similar point. Cambone and his superiors, the consultant said, âcreated the conditions that allowed transgressions to take place. And now weâre going to end up with another Church Commissionââthe 1975 Senate committee on intelligence, headed by Senator Frank Church, of Idaho, which investigated C.I.A. abuses during the previous two decades. Abu Ghraib had sent the message that the Pentagon leadership was unable to handle its discretionary power. âWhen the shit hits the fan, as it did on 9/11, how do you push the pedal?â the consultant asked. âYou do it selectively and with intelligence.â  âCongress is going to get to the bottom of this,â the Pentagon consultant said. âYou have to demonstrate that there are checks and balances in the system.â He added, âWhen you live in a world of gray zones, you have to have very clear red lines.â  Senator John McCain, of Arizona, said, âIf this is true, it certainly increases the dimension of this issue and deserves significant scrutiny. I will do all possible to get to the bottom of this, and all other allegations.â  âIn an odd way,â Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said, âthe sexual abuses at Abu Ghraib have become a diversion for the prisoner abuse and the violation of the Geneva Conventions that is authorized.â Since September 11th, Roth added, the military has systematically used third-degree techniques around the world on detainees. âSome jags hate this and are horrified that the tolerance of mistreatment will come back and haunt us in the next war,â Roth told me. âWeâre giving the world a ready-made excuse to ignore the Geneva Conventions. Rumsfeld has lowered the bar.â

      OP-ED COLUMNIST  Clash of Civilizations By MAUREEN DOWD  Published: May 13, 2004 Testifying before the Senate yesterday, General Richard Myers admitted that we're checkmated in Iraq.  "There is no way to militarily lose in Iraq," he said, describing the generals' consensus. "There is also no way to militarily win in Iraq."  Talk about the sound of one hand clapping. And they say John Kerry is on both sides of issues.  Sounding like Mr. Kerry, General Myers summed up: "This process has to be internationalized. The U.N. has to play the governance role. That's how we're, in my view, eventually going to win."  The administration's demented quest to conquer Arab hearts and minds has dissolved in a torrent of pornography denigrating other parts of the Arab anatomy. George Bush, who swept into office on a cloud of moral umbrage, now has his own sex scandal â one with far greater implications than titillating cigar jokes.  The Bush hawks, so fixated on making the Middle East look more like America, have made America look un-American. Should we really be reduced to defending ourselves by saying at least we don't behead people?  Gripped in a "I can't look at them â I've got to look at them" state of mind, lawmakers grimly filed into private screening rooms on the Hill to check out the 1,800 grotesque images of sex, humiliation and torture.  "They're disgusting," Senator Dianne Feinstein told me. "If somebody wanted to plan a clash of civilizations, this is how they'd do it. These pictures play into every stereotype of America that Arabs have: America as debauched, America as hypocrites.  "Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz act like they know all the answers, almost like a divine right," she said. "They don't have a divine right, and they are wrong."  After 9/11, America had the support and sympathy of the world. Now, awash in digital evidence of uncivilized behavior, America has careered into a war of civilizations. The pictures were clearly meant to use the codebook of Muslim anxieties about nudity and sexual and gender humiliation to break down the prisoners.  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell said some photographs seemed to show Iraqi women being commanded to expose their breasts â such debasement, after a war that President Bush partly based on women's rights.  The problem, of course, is that the war in Iraq started with lies â that Saddam's W.M.D. were endangering our security and that Saddam was linked to Al Qaeda and 9/11.  In a public relations move that cheapens the heroism of soldiers, the Pentagon merged the medals for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, giving the G.W.O.T. medal, for Global War on Terrorism, in both wars to reinforce the idea that we had to invade Iraq to quell terrorism. The truth is that our invasion of Iraq spurred terrorism there and around the world.  That initial deception â and headlong rush to throw off international conventions and old alliances, and namby-pamby institutions like the U.N. and the Red Cross â led straight to the abuse of Abu Ghraib. Now the question is whether the C.I.A. tortured Al Qaeda operatives.  Officials blurred the lines to justify ideological decisions, calling every Iraqi who opposed us a "terrorist"; conducting rough interrogations, perhaps to find the nonexistent W.M.D. so they would not look foolish; rolling all opposition into one scary terrorist ball that did not require sensitivity to the Geneva Conventions or "humanitarian do-gooders," to use the phrase of Senator James Inhofe, a Republican.  Senator Fritz Hollings made it clear yesterday that Rummy has left us undermanned and undertrained in Iraq â another factor in the torture scandal. "Now, in a country of 25 million, you're trying to secure it with 135,000," he scolded Mr. Rumsfeld, adding: "We're trying to win the hearts and minds as we're killing them and torturing them." At least, he said sarcastically, Gen. William Westmoreland never asked a Vietcong general to take the town, "like we have for Falluja. We've asked the enemy general to take the town."  The hawks, who promised us garlands in Iraq, should have recalled the words of the historian Daniel Boorstin, who warned that planning for the future without a sense of history is like planting cut flowers.
