      July 8, 2002 2:07 AM   Ok, so Iâm not really in crisis.   I donât think.   I mean, is turning 25 really any different from those other big, mile-marker years? I made it through 13, 18, 21â¦this isnât any different, right?   I guess Iâd know if I was in crisis. Itâd feelâ¦like a crisis, right? Iâd be sleep-deprived, depressed, drinking too much, smoking too much, avoiding too much.  Well, maybe I am.   See, thatâs what I mean. The quarter-life crisis. Not necessarily a crisis, but a stage, a time period, a conundrum in my little world. That break from childhood, not quite to adulthood, but somewhere stuck in between. Purgatory. Done with the heaven-sent easiness of being a kid, not quite to the hell we call responsibility.    But Iâm turning 25. 25. Half way between 50, when the real crisis starts, and birth, when you donât have a clue what a crisis is.   So I think about itâ¦what does 25 really mean? Should I already have my shit together? Or is the clock ticking til that magic age 5 years down the road, when I really do have to grow up and make some decisions?   I look to those around me for some answers. Those just a bit older, a bit younger, to see where they are at. Yes, I know, you canât compare. But still, 25 is a universal age. And Iâm pretty sure this crisis is a newfound universality as well. Or maybe itâs as old as time.   After much intense study over drinks at the bar, too many iced-mochas, and long drives to absolutely nowhere, I think Iâve broken our mixed up world of twenty-somethings down into 3 pretty distinct groups.    The first group I like to refer to as the over achievers. The ones I sat around the table with on high school graduation night discussing all the possibilities over strawberry flavored wine coolers.   We all had it figured out then, at the wise old age of 18. This will happen when Iâm 23, that when Iâm 25, that when Iâm 27, and by the time I hit 30â¦itâll be perfect. I fell off that train somehow, but theyâ¦they keep chugging along.   Despite all obstacles, or perhaps none at all, they did it exactly how they planned. They got their college degrees, sometimes 2. The mortgage bills appear like clockwork. They have to go home to let the pets out, or to pay the baby sitter. New cars, retirement plans, savings accounts, funds for this and that.   Oh, and did I mention marriage? Just Â¼ of the way into their lives theyâve already found The One to be with forever. Forever. Thatâs a damn long time. To put it simply, they did it exactly as they said they would. And god did they make it look easy.   Then thereâs the second groupâ¦the lost souls. A relative term to the former group, of course. Lost may not be correct. Perhaps they know exactly what they are doing. But you wouldnât know it just from talking to them.   Maybe they went to college. Maybe not. Maybe they did, and decided college was too elementary for them. Or too much work for someone with better things to do. Although, I think they refer to it as monotony, not work. Theyâve got jobs, sure. Some of them even have good ones. Most are renting. Yes, they know, they are wasting their money. But they are holding out for something more. No commitment, because they might be moving to that freethinking island outside of Thailand next month.   They are the ones who sit around the coffee shops our generation has cultivated so well and discuss the bigger issues of life. They know they know a lotâthey just arenât sure what all that knowledge is, or what to do with it. They are trucking through life, tooâ¦but they are waiting for something. They are waiting for enlightenment, or at least for that quick million so they donât have to worry about figuring it all out anymore. And love, wellâ¦whatâs love got to do with it? Commitment would put them way too close to those who like commitment, and they all know thatâs just plain evil.   There are the Singletons, to steal the term from one who did it so well. They seem to fall somewhere in between the two other groups, only because they arenât really sure where to go.   Well, thatâs not entirely true. Some know exactly where they want to be, but are waiting for someone else to get them there. Some just canât decide which side of themselves they want to sell out in order to pick a plan. And some just revel in the mystery.   The singletons are the ones searching for The One. They arenât afraid of commitment, just commitment to the wrong person. They went to college, they got the job they were supposed to, and then they realized they didnât want to do that at all. Theyâve got lofts in the city, but they still check the ads every weekend just in case they decide they want a home of their own. And hopefully by the time they find it they wonât have to sign those papers alone.  They have the plan the overachievers have, but the difficulty in committing to it that the lost souls feel. Because they could be wrong. What if they are wrong, and their life ends up somewhere they arenât sure they want it to be? So they teeter somewhere in between.   Having trouble placing yourself? Maybe this will help:   The Friday Night Plan The Over Achievers are at home having a couples dinner party, drinking white wine. The wives are discussing the woes of their mother-in-laws, the husbands are discussing why it is their wives have a problem with their mothers. They talk about who might get laid off, the sprinkler system they had to put in last weekend to meet their covenant code, and who will go off the Pill first. The wine kicks in, the girls get a little roudy, and the guys laugh at the familiarity of it all. The evening ends just after midnight, when they all realize theyâve got to go grocery shopping and buy new blinds the next day.     The Lost Souls are one of three places: the local barânot the trendy one in the latest issue of Westword, but the old standby where everyone knows your name, but doesnât really get your story; the aforementioned coffee shopânot Starbucks, because they donât promote capitalism; or at home. All three places will contain ashtrays full of the remnants of deep thought. If they are at the bar, they are just drunk enough to have their head in their hands, wondering what the hell the world is doing, and how it can be surviving without them. If they are at the coffee shop, they are spouting their wisdom in a caffeine-induced madness, marveling at how no one else can see it how simple it is. And if they are homeâ¦well, it depends if they chose depression or mania for the evening to determine which of the above references apply. Either way, the evening ends around 5 am when their eyes are too blurry to keep open and their thoughts are tangled enough to ensure restless sleep.  The Singletons are undoubtedly at that Westword bar, the place name Mostly likely to Get You a Mate For Life. Or at least for the evening. Until the alcohol sets in, things are separated by sex. The men are discussing the odds of the upcoming alumni game, all the while checking out the options around them. The women are discussing which ex-boyfriend will be at that same game, all the while checking out the options around them. For both the conversation drifts toward work, they bitch about how boring it is, they move back to checking out the scene for prospects. As the evening goes on and the bar tab grows, the groups intermingle. People pick their temporary soul mates. Some disappear to the darkest nook to learn more about each other, others just head for the door so as not to waste time. Those left over pick up their things as the man laughing knowingly at the bar declares last call. The evening ends at 2, when the stragglers get kicked out and the shackers fall asleep wondering what the morning after will be like.   All three groups are confused. All, in the silence of their own thoughts, wonder if this is all there really is? It canât be. Our parents had it figured out by now, didnât they? And their parentsâhell, they had 4 kids at our age. They might not have been happy all the time, but they made it through, didnât they? So why do we struggle with what they made look so easy?   The only thing Iâve come up with is that it was just as hard for them. Sure, things may have been defined a little earlier. Perhaps their quarter-life crisis was at 20, or 17. But still, they hit it just like we are.  The only reason we didnât see it because we were in diapers. We were in that blissful stage where we didnât have to figure it out, because they did for us. And we didnât know they were confused, too, because they never showed it around us. The arguments where in the other room. The confusion was discussed behind closed doors.   And they made all those choices before the crisis, or during the crisis, when it was too late to change their minds. They were in it and we are still figuring it out. So they waited for the next out, at 40 or 50, when that classic mid-life hits, when any rash decisions wonât seem so rash, because, after all, itâs a stage.   Just like this is. A stage. The difference, and the beauty is, that none of us are stuck enough to have to wait another 25 years to fix it.   We wonât have to explain to our teary-eyed children that we didnât know what we were doing because we were so young. That we are sorry, but Daddy just doesnât love Mommy anymore. That you have to pay for college on your own because Iâm just not satisfied with my job, so Iâm going to massage school. Maybe we wonât have to introduce our children to the one we found to replace their parent, the one whoâs 20 years younger and makes us feel not so confused.   Maybe weâll figure it out before we get into the thick of things, before bringing kids into this world who one day will be saying, I donât want to be as unhappy as my parents are.   So even if we are confused, maybe thatâs the way to go. Be confused now, before it counts. Be a little mixed up before it matters to someone else. Maybe weâll teach our own children that itâs ok not to know, as long as you take the time to figure it out.   I try to figure out which group I worry about the most. The one whose results I fear beyond the others. The one I want pick up in my arms and say, Please, just think about what you are doing.   I think we are all equally lost.   Itâs not just the Lost Souls. Because, at least as lost as they are, they are still thinking.   And itâs not the Singletons, because as much as they want it all, at least they know what they want.   And itâs not the Over Achievers, because at least they did it. Something. Anything.  For any group, for any category, whether you fall neatly into one or are spread across all three, at least you are trying. The magic is, we are all trying to figure it out. And we are doing it with the past as reference, and with the future as a goal.   If I believe nothing else, Iâve got to believe there canât be too much crisis in that.

      I lie here and dream of you touching me. And yet you wonât. Unless. Iâm tired of unless. I want real. I want now. I want you. And I donât want games. And I donât want only whens. I want all the time. I want every time. I want you. You to touch me. You to kiss me. You to make me scream. Not only when. Not unless. Now. Always. Iâm tired of not knowing when it will be ok. It needs to be ok all the time Or none of the time. One or the other. Physical or not.  Pick a thought, dammit. And touch me. Feel me. Let me feel you. Let me make you scream. Let me feel the water pouring over me. The sensations within me. The look of bewilderment that follows. I want you. And I want you  To admit You want me. All the time. Every time. Any time. Without any conditions Regulations Or requirements. I want us to want each other. And I want us to take each other. With everything in us. Until I scream. You scream. And a look of perfection follows.

      Close your eyes. Breathe, and let the rhythm of your breath calm you to a point of clarity. Picture where that clarity takes you--the most tranquil place in the depths of your soul. And when you have reached that place, are truly there, imagine Love joining you. Breathe in love, let the taste of it dance across your tongue, let its sounds enter your ears, and the smell fill your being. See it, and feel it, and truly believe it is all you imagine it to be. All of that, only that, mingling with the tranquility within you. That is loveâ¦that is what you are searching for. Perhaps that is what you have felt at one time. Or maybe itâs what you feel every day. Brought about by one person, by many, by only you. Love is so many things, so different for every person. No love is wrong. The magic is in finding someone who will love you the way you want to be loved, and who will allow you to love them in the way they feel is right. In finding someone who makes you want to take down your own barriers, rather than haphazardly doing it themselves. Someone who allows you to see all the world through their eyes, only to realize that you are looking through your own. Love is so much, and so different, and so real in all those different ways.

      Friday evening, weâve been drinking, 2am I swear I might propose. We close the tab, split a cab, call each other up when we get home.   I hear those lines on my car stereo and canât help but feel the familiar feeling. Those wordsâ¦2amâ¦I might proposeâ¦how many times has that happened? How many times have we gotten to that point in some state helped or hindered by the alcohol running through our blood, our willingness to let go of the bullshit and play what if?   Have you ever been in one of those relationshipsâ¦one that, on some days, shouldnât even be called that, and on othersâ¦on others the term is not near enough. The feelingâ¦the intensityâ¦the realness of it all to you and he, no matter what the world says. You have your good times, where you canât stand to be apart. Where the end of the day canât come fast enough just so you can sit and talk about nothing and everything at all. And other daysâ¦other days where it hurts so much you throw your arms up in surrender, because what is the point of the madness? Itâs got to be easier than thisâ¦  Thereâs got to be some rhyme or reason to it all. Or maybe none at allâ¦maybe thatâs the point, that there isnât any, and when you stop fighting the insanity itâs not so crazy after all. As the movie saidâ¦weâre better together than apart. Maybe some peopleâ¦some relationshipsâ¦hell maybe all of themâ¦just have to realize that no body loves like they do in books, in moviesâ¦the perfect loves where it just falls into place and thatâs that. But now that I think about it, most movie loves are tumultuous, too. Tumultuous to the end, but still you sit there with your bag of popcorn and your wadded up tissues, yelling at the screen that they really do love each other. Go to her! Find him! You are meant to beâ¦who cares about the madness?   So it comes down to thatâ¦are all relationships madness? Are all real relationships just as crazy and beautiful as the ones on screen? And if so, why do the Hollywood ones seem so perfect and meant to be and the real life ones seem soâ¦so impossibly confounding?   Are we meant to confuse ourselves? Are we supposed to make things harder than they are? Is true love only true love after we put in the requisite yelling/fighting/crying/mending time? Would any of us be happy with love we didnât have to fight for? One that really did just âmake sense.â Or would we turn away in boredom, thinking thereâs got to be more than this?   We met four years ago over an espresso machine. An espresso machine, for Gods sake. How Hollywood is that? Have we ever âdatedâ? Hell no, and absolutely. Have I loved him from the very first moment? Without question. Have I hated him, has he made me cry? Letâs just say our voices have grown raw from the arguing. Does all that mean its real, true, movie style love, or a horribly over drawn relationship? Iâm still up in the air on that one. All I know for sureâ¦Iâm still fighting for it. Isnât that what Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy taught us? Itâs the ones we fight for that countâ¦but when do the credits role on this film?   So when the fighting gets to be too muchâ¦to the point where I canât do it anymore, where Iâm ready to throw in my towel and call it a dayâ¦thatâs when I get reflective. Iâm still not sure if thatâs the best or worst time. But what I come up with is thisâ¦we only fight when it involves the world outside of us. When others step in with their words of wisdom or their meddling waysâ¦thatâs when we fight. When one of us faces the other side, those saying what are you thinking? We bring it home, we work around it, we wonder why the other is picking needless fights, and then it comes out. Someone else, outside of us, questioned what we are doing. And, probably because we question it every day in private, and probably because itâs so easy to come up with the answers to those questions, we yell. We fight. I sit in silence, or I fire unending questions your wayâ¦questions your answers wonât answer. You try to console me, I wonât hear it. You get mad at my defiance so you join the game, fire back with things I canât contend with.   All of it, every bit of it, is outside of us. But does that mean its wrong? Does that mean others are just bringing things to our attention we wonât face on our own, or do they simply not understand? We tend to fall upon the latter, but is that right? In the theater, when you are fighting for that onscreen love that makes all the sense in the world, you understand. So why do people not understand us? Is it just because they donât see all the secret moments? Or are the moments secret because we donât want others to see them, knowing that even if they do theyâll ask the same questions?   Are we using others arguments as weak excuses to continue against the odds? Do they know what they are talking about? Or do they have no clue?   The thing isâ¦people come to us for advice every day. They seek us out, knowing weâll have perspective on what they may not. And we, we do not seek that out. In honesty, weâve taught ourselves to defend against it, knowing that what they say will not be âhow it is.â But maybe it is. Maybe itâs exactly what weâd be yelling up at that big movie screen if we were watching ourselves?   Either way, you arenât with me tonight. And it feels like shit. Every night you go out on your own feels ok at first, and then as the hours tick by it feels not so okâ¦and that says two things to me. Neither of which hasnât been said before. So we continue in this cycle because we donât listen to those who try to stop us, and because we believe strongly enough in the good days that we can justify that decision. So when does the movie stop, and reality begin?

      By all rough estimates, there are over 100,000 songs that make me think of him. No, seriously, Iâm pretty sure that number is right on. I started counting, and I lost track somewhere around 78, but decided to just round up to something that sounded reasonable.   To be fair, probably only 50,000 evoke direct memories of him, and the other 50,000 remind me of the situation now, or how it used to be, or how it could have been, or how it should have beenâ¦damnitâ¦  Because of this, itâs a real challenge to make it through my day and meet my current goal. That is, to not think about him. Ever. I wake up every day and think, today Iâm not going to think about him at all. But then Iâve blown it already. Because by declaring Iâm not going to think about him Iâve evoked all those thoughts Iâm not supposed to have about why Iâve decided its best not to think about him. So the plan really does get shot to hell right off the bat. But someday Iâm not going to have to remind myself first thing, and thatâs when the songs are gonna kill me.  See, Iâll jump in my car, and as soon as I turn that key the music is going to start. Itâll either be from some cheesy radio station (I know, soft rock is not helping the situation), or from one of the various CDs of âstolenâ music currently in my possession. Anyway, itâll start playing, and by sheer odds the song will be one of the fateful 100,000 that will destroy my plan yet again.  I guess I should be honest. My current, more realistic plan is not really not to think about him at all. Itâs to see how far I can get into the day without thinking about him. Iâm trying to work up to the big stuff, and I figure making it through my morning shower is a good start. Small steps, you know. If I can get all the way through the 15 minute commute to hell (I mean work), I might even be able to cut down to once a week with Sherry. She probably wonât like that too much. Therapists never really like âimprovingâ patients. It cuts down on their ârainy dayâ fund.   But donât worry Sherry, youâre safe with me. Right now I donât even have to be fully awake for things to hit the fan. As soon as I hear that alarm clock beeping it reminds me of how he used to hate getting up in the mornings, just like I hate getting up in the mornings, and how weâd just layâ¦damnit. See what I mean? He just wonât go away!

      Hereâs a hint: Iâm a 4. An Enneagram 4, that is. To those of you who donât know, well, you just donât know. But for those of you who do---Iâm a classic, textbook style 4.  I guess it shouldnât really be surprising. The number, in purely numerical terms. Fours have always been there, been a part of my life.   I once spent the entire day at the race track betting on the 4th horse, and made quite a killing. He spent his time pouring over the racing books searching for the answers in the facts, the statistics, the odds. He wasnât exactly pleased with the results--me winning on a âlucky number.â But at the end of it all, there was a certain glimmer in his eye, at the sort of magic of it all.   I think he always liked that about me. My faith in the unexplainables. My confidence in intangible things like that. Funny how that--my faith in something unexplainable like love--ended up being the end of us.  But that day at the race track, he liked that about me, even if he tried not to let on. Years later, he always new about that lucky number of 4.
