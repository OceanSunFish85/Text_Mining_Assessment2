      I can't help but remember yesterdays madness, when two people got together and painted their faces, one with cat whiskers and a nose, the other with black lines under her eyes to keep out the nights moon glare. Armed with small plastic Squirt guns, called âYellow Feverâ and âChef running walking water towerâ. They were called Curtis and Dane and they had water bottles tied with white shoelaces around their waists like belts for quick reloads, bare feet, and they were running like wild turkeys in peak hunting season all over "Graceland"! After a Ruthless battle of wits, leg power and incompetence, these couple of villains made a break for it to âMy Sisterâs Houseâ. On the way "finding" a small plastic Carriage with only two wheels in witch to put their shoes in they carted it around with them. Swinging happily then suddenly alarmed by boat police, they dropped the carriage and took their shoes back to the unsure security of âMongoose Hillâ where they contacted their leader, âMaynayâ. âMaynayâs Angelsâ weâre safe for another day he assured them and they stopped worrying. And so ends another great adventure (well the first one anyways) of, âMaynayâs Angelsâ!!!!!

       I bought this slinkster cool dart board the other day and set it up in my room. I've alwasy enjoyed throwing darts at peoples pictures, not just becasue i dislike the people, it's not always the case, but for the pure fun of it.       This is about the time i came up with The Nixon Game". You'd think there'd be rules to the game, but there aren't. The only real goal is to make so many holes in the picture that you wipe the bastreds swine grin off his face! Yes, "The Nixon Game" is great and i'm sure it's made it's way into the homes of many Americans. It's a family game, so please, take you time, get out the old dart board and play a couple of rounds with the kiddies...for old times sake.
