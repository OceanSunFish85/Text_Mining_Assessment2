      alright alright. I just came back from Sta. Lucia East mall where I usually go every Saturday. And guess who I got to talk to there?? Si Joross! hehe kakatuwa nga e. Kc last time na I went to Robinsons Metro East naman (another mall na plgi ko pnupuntahan) I saw Hero, Sandara and Melissa. They have a shooting for a tv show called SCQ Reload or something like that. Si sandara cute, Melissa sexy and Hero ok lng. Then kaninaas we were walking sa mall (me, kim, nina, ate pina) we saw lots of people outside a certain store. So syempre we moved din to see what the commotion is all about. The store is "the HipStore" ata un I forgot na e bast when we got there sb nila si Joross daw nandun.Of course we're like "Oh tlga?? halika pasok tyo!!". So we went in the store kc la naman shado pumapasok, ung mga tao dun lng sila sa labas so we went in nga and un nga he's there. tas si Roxanne nandun din nakaupo lng. Joross was wearing white shirt and pants,ung parang pang medical student kc meron din cla shooting that day.So there we were watching Joross while pretending to browse their clothes although la tlga kmi balak bumili kc I don't like their style e, pangit hehe tas biglang medyo rami na tao inside so sb nung salesperson na bading "Oh ung mga di bibli pwede labas muna? mmaya na kyo pa autograph" so ung mga tao labasan din cla. E sb ko kay ate pina mamaya na kmi labas kunyari bibli kmi so we stayed. Si nina and kim lumabas na ata un. So nakakatuwa coz in thre store was the salesperson, roxanne with 3 girls na alalay nya ata and Joross. He's buying clothes ata e kc I can hear him say to the saleslady na parang "may size ba kyo nito?" blah blah. So nandun lng kmi ni Ate Pina watching him tas sb ko "uy kausapin natin". E db parang sayang naman nadun na kami e so might as well say hi to him. I don't want his autograph naman e, just hi lng. So marami parin tao outside the store and I was pulling ate pina kc ayaw nya gumalaw and pumunta ako kay Joross. nakakatawa nga e kc pinapanood ako nung saleslady haha pero nhihiya din tlga ako and ang lamig lamig ng kamay ko. so un nga I went to him, kinalabit ko cya and told him "hi". Tas he smiled and said "hi". hahahaha kakakilig nga e. tas nahihiya na tlga ako nun and I don't know what to say next so pumunta nlng ako sa likod and went straight to the dressing room. Then I called Steph kaya lng nagtututor pa cya nun e. Basta un. nakakatuwa lng tlga coz I get to say "hi" to him tas he smiled pa. He was wearing shades that time nga e. Tas un hehe after that I went to folded and hung, bought a shirt na on sale tas went to the ground floor. Punta natio then bili kami sa Ice Monster then ate sa Le Couer de France ba un spelling? basta dun then pag baba ni kim sb nya may shooting pa daw and that Sandara is there. So after we ate we went upstairs sa may bowling center and un nga si Roxanne, Hero, Sandara, Michelle, Melisa, Joseph (cute cute cute) and Raphael is inside Tokyo Tokyo. break ata nila un e. si Joross naman nasa taas sa may tattoo na shop, ewan ko kung ano ginagawa nya dun. Tas nagshooting pa cla so we watched the shooting. Si sandara kumakanta tas si melissa parang kilig na kilig then si Hero parang narecognize nya ung voice. basta we watched them then tsaka lng kmi umuwi. ang dami dami ngang tao tas ung wanapo nkakatawa pa kc everytime mas taong maghaharang sa amin sa front (kmi kc ung nsa harap) kakalabitin nya tas sasabihan nya ng "pwede usog kayo dun? nauna kami dito e" na parang pataray na voice haha katawa nga e, tas ung mga tao sumusunod naman hehe   ok parang ang haba na nito ah, basta we weren't able to watch king arthur kc kulang money and time plus I really don't wanna watch it naman e so un. Catwoman nalang next week and malay mo may shooting again tas si Joseph naman ung maka hi ko hehe

      "Do you like me?" I asked the blue blazer. No answer. Silence bounced out of his books. Silence fell off his tongue and sat between us and clogged my throat. It slaughtered my trust. It tore cigarettes out of my mouth. We exchanged blind words, and I did not cry, and I did not beg, blackness lunged in my heart, and something that had been good, a sort of kindly oxygen, turned into a gas oven. Do you like me? How absurd! What's a question like that? What's a silence like that? And what am I hanging around for, riddled with what his silence said?    cute noh? nkuha ko lng cya sa myspace e gawa ata ng isang tao dun basta.. I'm going out later coz im gona watch king arthur. actually di ko naman trip un e pero kc la naman cyado mgawa pag ikot ikot lng so i'll watch a movie nlng pero ung main tlga na gagaewin ko is to buy earrings. well right now i'm just eating ung longgarice from mcdo and campbell's corn and chicken soup and pommy on my lap. and santol din pla. gs2 ko un, santol i mean tas may asin yum! cge na i'll just write here later whatever may happen mamaya..bye

      like that isn't normal?? well I don't exactly hate him..I can never hate him! It's just that I'm annoyed because I tried talking to him and it's like parang ang feeling feeling pa niya. Maybe it's just me..idk. basta bwisit tlga. i mean di naman tlga bwisit..cgro prang super nwalan na tlga ako ng pagasa. I lost all my hope of ever being friends with him. I mean i know na out of 100% is 10% lng ung chance pero since he's my classmate then mas malaki pa ung chance right? but like I said la na tlga. and it's sad..pero ok lng. it's not like he's my life or anything naman noh! like i can't live without him?! grabe nman im not that in love with his face! He's not even that cute up close, really..pero there's something in him that i like. di pla something pero khit anong gwin ko, khit na isa isahin ko pa all of his flaws, i'd still like him. so cya like ko cya..and the others? mga crushes ko lng! :) so un. i got to talk him..not really talk talk, just a few words which is so wlang kwenta! bsta kc i really feel na he is so conceited, na he thinks i still have a crush on him and that i like him so much which is true, admit, pero bat pa nya kailangan isispin un at ipakita db?? edi feeling nga! tas tingin pa cya ng tingin..myb mas less na kaysa b4 coz i don't look at him that much na since i don't wanna give him the impression thati really do like him. feeling nga tlga cya. that's all i can say... glad i had let that all out.

              Câmon people, move fast, she thought.                       It was a bright sunny afternoon. This was kind of unusual when itâs fall. Birds were flying in the sky, butterflies searching for nectars, people roaming around the city. At this time of day, in the city of Denver, you can see a lot of people walking around. Some were working; others were just lazily walking around, some were visiting from a neighboring city. And in the case of Marie Aames, she just came from Mr. Parkerâs class which lasted for two boring hours on a discussion about atoms and molecules. When the bell rang, she practically run out of the classroom avoiding Peter and Warner, two guys who are deeply infatuated with her. She knew at this time that there will be a lot of people in the grocery store so she needed to be there first. And now she was here in the line waiting for her groceries to be punched. Alright, my turn, she thought. When she opened the door of the grocery store and felt a touch of the air, she breathed a sigh of relief. God, it was so hot in there it was like I was in a big oven, she thought. But the minute she stepped on the pavement, she was hit by a lad who she hadnât seen. All her groceries were scattered on the pavement while the guy who was skateboarding fell on his butt.          âHey!â Marie exclaimed as she watched a can of Coke rolling down the road.          âOh, Iâm so sorry miss. I didnât mean to. Here, let me help youâ the guy said.          âYeah right! Next time donât skate if you donât know how! You just end up bumping in to people.â Marie shouted angrily while picking up all her remaining groceries.          âWhat? Excuse me but I do know how to skate. Itâs your fault. If only you were looking where youâre going to then this wonât happen. Thatâs why we have eyes, moron!â he retorted back.          âUh!â she stood up and faced the guy, âHow dare you call me a moron! Youâre the moron! Youâre the stupid one! Oh, the hell with you wasting my time and all.â Marie started to walk away angrily.          âYeah, you better go home because Iâm sick of hearing your voice shouting at me. I think my eardrum is ruined.â Marie suddenly stopped on her tracks and turned back to him. She glared at him from head to toe then back, raised her left eyebrow and said âWho do you think you are, Mister?â          âAnd who do you think you are?! Hereâs a piece of advice, just do your thing and mind your own business will you? Iâm off here!â          âYou better be!â she shouted at his retreating back. She noticed passer-bys looking at her. âWhat?!â The people glanced away. She went home pissed off. When she got home, she placed her remaining groceries on the table and sat on the sofa. She looked at the picture of Jake, her ex-beau. The guy has blonde hair and blue eyes. Typical guys that Marie falls for.          âOh Jake, why did you leave me? If only you saw Mr. Punky a while ago you could have smacked his face. That guy is such a know-it-all.â          âYou talking to the picture again Ria? And whoâs that know-it-all guy?â her friend, Bianca, said while entering the house.          âOh I wish Jakeâs still here.â          âOh câmon Rie! This guy broke up with you almost 3 months now and the asshole cheated on you. And you still want him back? Get real Rieâ Bianca replied.         âI know but you know. Why do you have to be so lucky when it comes to the L word unlike me? So so unlucky.â Marie complained.         âRia... lots of guys wants you! All you need to do is choose. Oh there are no popcorns?â         âOh yeah. Itâs because of some stupid guy downtown.â         âThe know-it-all? That him?â         âYeah. He was skating then he bumped me so all my groceries were scattered.â         âOh right.â Bianca arranged the remaining groceries. Marie was silent for a minute. Then a thought came up in her mind.         âIan, can you do me a favor?â         âIf it has something to do with money then no I wonât.â         âOh no no, thereâs no money involved. I was just thinking if you can hook me up with someone.â Marie smiled at her best friend.         âWhat? Rie, are you that desperate? Why donât you just go out with Cliff? Or better yet Todd? Why do you want me to hook you up with someone when there are loads of men you can choose from?â Bianca asked.         âItâs because I donât like any of them Ian. You know that! Ask Mark if he knows anyone he can hook me up with.â         âNow youâre also asking my boyfriend a favor? No, Marie Aames, I wonât hook you up with someone.â Bianca declined.         âYes.â Marie protested.         âNo.â         âYes, you will.â         âNo, I wonât.â         âPlease?â         âAlright!â Bianca sighed.         âThank you! I know I can depend on you!â Marie smiled and hugged her friend. Bianca laughed and hugged Marie back.         âOkay, can you ask Mark to set me up on a blind date with someone we both donât know? And a different guy from the one I usually go out with.â         âI probably could.â         âWhat about this Friday?â Marie suggested.         âYou mean the date? If Mark got one.â         âCool. But hey, choose one whoâs cute.â Marie grinned.         âSure. And a guy with a hell lot of patienceâ¦â Bianca joked.         âHey! That hurts!â Ria punched Ian playfully.         âWhatever!â Bianca punched back. The two were laughing and fooling around when the doorbell rang.         âOh that must be Mark. Let him come in and Iâll just change my clothes.â Bianca ran upstairs.         âOkay! Iâll go to work now Ian. See you later! Have fun.â Marie shouted and went to the door.         âHey Marie!â Mark greeted.         âOh hey Mark. Gotta split..well have fun you two.â         âNeed a ride?â Mark offered.         âOh no, thanks. Iâll take the cab. Bring her home early, we got an exam tomorrow.â         âSure maâam, I willâ he smiled and saluted.    actually di pa nga sya tapos e..tapos meron din ako isa pang story gngwa. i'll post the excerpt nun next time :)
