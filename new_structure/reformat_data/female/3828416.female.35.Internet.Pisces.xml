                     A few emails back about the site from some good  friends. Ofcourse they are biased!           "Looks good and very informative"          and          "The content is fabulous. The sections are easy to  read and it's very practical.The colours are easy on the eye...are you going  to get in banner adverts?"          My friend / lawyer is worried I am giving too much  information away... maybe I am?

                     Letting a few select people know about my  site. Most of them are friends who have heard about the site but were not  really too sure what I was dong!          I wrote:            Hi                 I have finally made my website live,  but it has a lot of work to be done on it yet. The homepage is a little  boring, but I wanted to send the URL out to a few people to get some initial  impressions back. I am going to do a bit of work on it this weekend, so it  is a work in progress.                 The idea of the site is for it to be a  resource for business owners who need practical advice for marketing their  websites.                 the URL is      http://www.webmarketingnz.com                       Have a look and let me know what you  think, but please, be gentle, as it has been a massive undertaking writing all  of that content (and yes, it is all original)!

      Tuesday June 22 2004 was the day I finally  stopped procrastinating  and put  urlLink Web Marketing NZ  live.  Work on the site started over a year earlier after I quit my job. I started writing a website planning guide, something that I thought was going to be an e-book.   A few weeks later I left for my trip around Europe.  When I came back 3 months later I had no job, no car, and very little money.  Got a job and settled back into the 9 to 5 routine. But I continued to write and eventually decided the writing would become a website.  And so, the site was live.  A scary moment as I was not sure it was really ready for viewing, but I knew that if I kept putting it off it would never get online!

      This blog is about the development and marketing of a website I have created.  I thought it would be an interesting way of recording the site's history and what works and doesn't work with the web marketing.

                     Have added the Google AdSense adverts to the web  design section of the site. Google has not fully spidered the site yet so  the adverts being displayed are for good causes.

                     Last nightI applied to join the Google  AdSense program. Had read a lot about people's experiences on the  programover at  www.webmasterworld.com . Maybe  it's too soon to try it out?

      Got my first search engine referral today - it was from a New Zealand search website, someone using the phrase  urlLink 'search engine marketing  promotion'  very exciting.

             BODY { 	BACKGROUND-POSITION: left top; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia }         Realised I am being a bit of a baby about the site and have  decided to spent a bit of this weekend looking for links. I know the power  of building up links, and may also have to consider paying for a few of them  such as on the website directories. Though I am not too keen on doing  this. I spend all day marketing other people's websites so it is a good  experience for me to go through wondering when I am going to see a return on  investment on mine.

                     Getting more visitors from NZSearch - with someone  searching for  http://www.searchnz.co.nz/cgi-bin/search?q=online+website+advertising and  Web Marketing NZ ranked at number 6. Also can see that I am getting some  hits on 'budget website" terms after having moved the  budget website  address over  to Web Marketing NZ. Ranking well in NZSearch for these terms too.

      Well, having checked my stats it seems that visitors are landing on some particular pages within the site, but it is not showing any search engine referrals.  Might have to invest in some better stats.

      After writing so much information and re-writing and thinking I had a great concept I now realise how clients feel! Google is not taking much notice of me. It keeps coming back, but does it index any more pages. NO! I am feeling as impatient as the next website owner. I know about the Google sandbox, I know the site is only just a month old, but I want traffic! Have done very little to the site due to time being taken up with many other things. I know I need to be spending this time writing more content, but I don't know if I have the heart to do it. Keen to start on a new idea I have had but know I need to keep on concentrating on the Web Marketing site before diving on into to something else.

                     Go confirmation that GONZOZ have added a link to  the category I requested. Refreshing to get a link back so quickly.  Still don't have PR, and Google is not showing any backlinks. Wondering  (like everyone) when the next PR update is. Saw on some forum that some guy  things it will happen on the 10th (which is tommorrow). That would be  great.
