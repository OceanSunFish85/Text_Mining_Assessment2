      Last night I was nauseated by him.   He has been looking for a friend of his for almost ten years. Last night he finally found him.  Tragic really, he died of AIDS. I felt immediate sympathy. Asked whether or not it was a surprise.  His response troubled me, I believed that I was perhaps a bit more open than this. Apparantly not.   "Sure", he says. " I took pictures of him having sex with at least two different men, he had at least six lovers that I was aware of."  I have to admit that the thought of this makes my skin crawl a bit. He took PICTURES??!!?? Should this bother me? Perhaps not, considering that I have indulged more than once with my own sex but the thought of the pictures... I feel like the small town hick that perhaps I am. He is a Photographer after all.  The conversation drifts, quite a bit... I ask him, perhaps because I am starting to question his 'orientation' a bit, when the last HIV test was for him. How many lovers in between.  " Years" , he says.  Hmmmm. And three lovers besides. One a fetish dancer in New York. No protection.  I am throwing up all night now. Can't sleep. He will not touch me for some time, I do not will it. Perhaps I am insane but the thought of his touching me now makes me feel violated somehow. Disgusted. I do not want to share my intimacy with him at all.  Sic.

       That was five days ago, so much can change in five daysâ¦  Sean was home this weekend. He left again late this morning. We sat in the coffee house and he was amped, just having won another client here. I am subdued, my hands alternately gripping my coffee cup, shredding and crumpling my stack of napkins. He may not even be here for Fourth of July weekend.   Impatience, disappointment, gnaw their way to a corner of my mind, -a dull, constant reminder of what brought us here in the first place. Who is fooling whom now? I canât quite put my finger on it but something doesnât smell right.   He is smiling, trying to cheer me up, cheer me on. He does want to fix things, work them out. He is sitting there, peering over his glasses periodically, looking mischievous as he always does, making lists of what we can fix. Why we should be together. One by one. A list maker.

      MY discontent.    I wish that this shit, this merde, would stop bouncing around in my head, sticking in my cranium, like an Echo,   Echo,   Echoâ¦    My anger bumps and grinds and spins out of control. Hell hath no furyâ¦    Is my anger so focused toward him because I am righteous or because he is itâs most worthy and convenient target? Regardless, it is ultimately mine, my own creation and my own animal, a child of what sickness of heart I cannot imagine.    The anger, my feelings of helplessness about my entire situation (kid, money, hormones, menstruation, sleep deprivation, boyfriend) are just being compacted more and more. I visualize each layer compressing further and further until finally, it pushes BACK! in protest against my attempts to plunge it harder and further down. How much more can I take before I EXPLODE!!!! like a tick, overfull and fat?  I feel as though it is happening now.    I am using Joey as a valve.  Fucking him is explosive. He is explosive, like playing with fire. But playing with fire is exciting and his breath on my neck, my breasts, my thighs, leaves me trembling and so full of LUST!!! God that boy can fuck, and yes, I am his whore. Just like he says I am. Gladly.    But then, there is just Joey. A bit sad, still in love with me (and am I kidding myself by saying I no longer love him?) Deeply sad, not having any idea of what he wants. Crazy Joey.    I am afraid of him at times, but I know that he would fight for me, that he is honorable. That he is a MAN and treats me like a woman, even if I am a lust struck whore. I am his whore, and no one elseâs.    He is hard enough to break yourself on.    I am Seanâs mother, because he is not a man, he is not honorable. He is weak and I am tired of being a mother.  Do I even want this?    He feels so soft and tastes so sweet. This sweet, short, hairy little man. He is spoiled, and truth be told, I enjoy spoiling him. I love his soft lips, his small penis in my hand-in my mouth-against my belly. He is not strong and hard-you could not break waves against this man.    Small like a child -and like a child he does not know his own mind-he has to be sheltered and coddled, bathed, powdered and pampered. No matter how much fun it is to do so, again, I am no mother.
