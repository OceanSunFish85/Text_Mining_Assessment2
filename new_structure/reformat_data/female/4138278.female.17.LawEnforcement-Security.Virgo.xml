      sometimes things strike me the wrong way. sometimes i am blind to things and then when i realize them i feel like a fucker for making these mistakes, but the truth is that every now and then i feel like they werent mistakes. but in reality and in maybe 90% the time i realize they were.  i absolutely despise when things fade away. its like the worst thing that could happen. it proves that things arent as good as we think they are or were and it proves that things arent as valid and strong as previously believed. its horrible really. if youre going to end something you have to end it brutally and in a final sort of manner. fading out is a biatch. like even with summer it just seems as though it fades out instead of having one last great night or moment. its horrible really.  here are some names i like and will potentially name my children if i have some or one. emerson-for the man gabriel- for the angel and the name is a nice one. mary-for the mom, my mom. lucy- lucy in the sky with diamonds ben- for the many famous bens owen-i just like the name fuckers brigid-you know those irish people. grace-thats one of my favorites    sometimes i talk pure and utter bullshit or just make little promises that arent very important but i still dont come through on them. like ill say ill call you back and i never get around to it. i want to stop but its hard. i live a life soaked in bullshit. im a fucking con and sometimes it sucks.   here are some things i would like: id like to actually win at football. theres been a drought. id like to be able to read these books for school. id like to meet someone, anyone who just blows me away in their awesomeness and intellect. id like my best friend who isnt really my best friend to want to be best friends still id like fuckface to realize "hey im a huge fuckface, and im ignorant" id like to have a wonderful sunday id like people to stop acting and beleiving they are in love when they are clearly not. id like everyone to understand me a bit more so that i dont feel like a retard id like to get new shoes id like to get a very nice id. id like to get this id as a birthday present, from my family. id like to see u2 live. id like to be able to put thoughts to action. id like to play under a cork jersey.  but some of these are just fanicful dreams and others like wanting a new pair of shoes are very real and attainable to me. bc people need shoes   you know whatever you feel is valid and you shouldnt feel stupid or retarded for feeling that way, because when it comes down to how you feel you cant be wrong. you cant judge yourself according to what other people do or how other situations are handled. like if you feel a certain way you should be outspoken about it and you shouldnt hide. like if youre hurt you should say fuck you, you fucked up youre a bitch. and if youre happy you should be like fuck you im happy. and whatever else, its true the way you feel. and you cant bullshit people, especially when it matters, or even when they feel like its important. you just cant fuck with people in that way, its just not nice.</post></Blog>
