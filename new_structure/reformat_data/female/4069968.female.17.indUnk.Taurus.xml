           [musik] - Franz Ferdinand "Tell Her Tonight"    [mood] - bouncy            hung out with the group today. or...last night. whatever. ben and sarah were dressed in their clown gear so we decided to go to taco bell with them. it was fun. though no one really was surprised. apparently they must get a lot of clowns in the stupid place?        kosta called randomly while we were eating, and chris kept asking if it was the "child molestor." Not as bad as chris' however... but anyway. i was too busy laughing at ben blowing up a heart shaped balloon and calling it an empty ball sac.        now i'm bored and only semi-tired. i got up around six-thirty yesterday evening, but hanging out seems to make me sleepy. meh. i said i would do something with K tomorrow. but if i never go to sleep i doubt it'll actually happen.        blah.        and now jamie needs someone to go with her to the movies to meet the guy she met off the internet.        boob.        jessica told me that franz ferdinand is coming to town this september. hm. maybe i can get the monies to go. although it's not actually going to be that expensive. i can take jamie...or someone. i love that freakin' band. happy voices and happy music. or...semi-happy music.        oh well.        it's slightly better then really sad emo.

       [musik] - Bright Eyes "Sunrise Sunset"   [mood] - bored             mwaha. i finally got one of these stupid things. i've conformed to what all the kiddies are doing with their ::xangas:: and ::livejournals:: not that i'm bad-mouthing the idea. i think it's kind of fun. to complain about your day to strangers and the occasional handful of friends.        yep yep.        so it's late, since i've have yet to go to sleep. ha. my mother gave me half a xanax in the hopes that i would be in bed before seven this morning. what a joke. i didn't even get semi-drowsy.        so...yeah.        half excited and half nervous about school starting. and no, it's not those cute little first day of school nervous jitters. it's "what am i going to do because leonard will be gone and this is my last year?"   suddenly i want to get insanely lost in my own head and never come out.        kosta called earlier, having a weird ass breakdown of sorts because he was feeling that his life was going nowhere. i didn't know what to say in response really. it was...i don't know. i experience the same thing a lot, but i just don't know how to deal with it when it's another person. my people skills suck. i couldn't exactly tell him, "hey it'll be ok and you'll figure it out" because that would have been a lie...i don't know if it'll be ok.        o  ne can only hope it so.
