      Do you ever wish you were somewhere else? I mean so badly you think of running away. I just wonder what life would be like if Igave up everything and split. Why didn't I ever backpack through Europe? I might be living in Greece. I may not have a large home, car, designer clothing, or an appointment at a day spa, but damn I would be living the dream. If you are a rich, good looking man with an accent and would like to run away with someone the total opposite of you, then I am your girl.   Well, back to life. I got my hair cut (beautiful as always). My hair is my one thing of beauty. I told my hairdresser that I must have been a very beautiful, skinny, fabulous, filthy rich woman in my last life, and I did something very very bad!!!!!! Atleast God had mercy and left the great hair. I did get a great makeover (I guess that's whatyou call it). I was actually able to recreate the look the next day. I look fabulous!   I am thinking of starting my own business. I am going to learn to embroider. I can then monogram any of my merchandise. I wonder if there is a market for an embroiderer in Greece?

      How exciting my own special place. I feel like someone might be listening.    Have you ever been to Georgia. That is where I live. Well, that is where I currently live. I am originally from Virginia. Georgia is, well, different. I went to the optometrist today. It took three hours. So many things like that have happened to me since I moved here. I finally let my irritation show in the third hour. Then I felt horrible. Why do we feel so bad (or even afraid) when we tell someone we are not satisfied. We spend an enormous amount of money every year on the service industry. Yet customer service in our country has become so bad that we feel we should write a thank you letter to McDonald's if the drive-thru attendant says, "have a nice day." Do you ever feel like you have come in at the end of something? Like the 60's seem so cheesy, but people said things like thank you and men held doors open for ladies. People seemed more happy. And nice! What do I know, I was not alive then. I am just going on what I see in the movies.    Ah, the movies! I love Hollywood. If my life were a movie I hope the leading man would be Brad Pitt. Or Sean Bean. Yes, I know they are very different. They are each beautiful in their own way. Brad is just beautiful. Sean is handsome and has an accent. In reality if my life were a moviethe leading man would probably be Jack Black. Oh well, at  least  he is funny.    Well, I have a hair appointment in the morning. Needless to say I will feel more Brad Pitt than Jack Black. Until the humidity brings me back to reality anyway.    Note: I am not the best writer. I know I have terrible punctuation. Please do not give me a hard time as I am a work in progress.
