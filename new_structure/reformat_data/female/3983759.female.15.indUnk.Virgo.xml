        I finally got my domain name up woot woot. At   urlLink  www.otherkinwolves.com   . Go me ::does dance:: To start off my lovely Wednesday, okay well it was my brothers birthday he's seven today HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHNNIE. I went to school and due to the junior class testing our periods were all messed up, so we had eight, seven, six, one, five, four, three, two. And during French i was on the computer andI got bored and sick of playing this game. Go to quia.com if ya wanna play with it, it stupid. But anyways I went and tried getting on AOL and the God damned school has it blocked. What the feck do they block people from sighing onto aim and AOL for. So I made an online journal woot woot. How fun is that!? But the weird thing is is that I already have a journal, as a matter of fact, in writing in it. What's the sense in that? Oh and here comes the White Flag song by Dido. ::hums:: aight over n out. OY!

        Its Sunday 12:36 pm and im still talking to Steph on the phone. I registered my new domain name and now my professional site will be up in about 72 hours WOOT WOOT. Go me!!   urlLink  www.otherkinwolves.com    . I also went to this cheesy site where this guy claims he's a graphic artist. But he uses psp7 and the graphics he charges big name companies for he makes in approximately 5 minutes. (10) if he's slow. I think I shall do that. &gt;evil laugh</post></Blog>
