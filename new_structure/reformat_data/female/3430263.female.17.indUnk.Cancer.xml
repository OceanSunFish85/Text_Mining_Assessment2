      hai nako. badtrip na nga, lalo pang naka2badtrip. nawala un pinost ko kanina d2!!!! badtrip........ hai. anyway, nd kme na2loy, as usual. badtrip pa koh xe naubos un card koh. i'm gonna be away for awhile. one of the reasons is that ubos na un card koh and i think it'll take some time bago pa me mkabili. also, badtrip ako!!! pag badtrip ako, naiinis ako sa mundo. another reason is that skul's gonna be here so i guess, nd muna me mka2post d2. bahala nah. bat ba gani2 buhay? keilangan pang mangyari ang mga bagay na nd moh nman gus2 mangyari. ewan. basta, badtrip ako!!!

      I lie beside a stranger  And I hear blue blood  Running trough his vain.  I really don't give a damn  Coz there's nothing in this world  That can stop me now.  I loved you the way I know  But you fit me back  Right in your pleasure glove,  Watch me now,  Don't underestimate  Coz you never ever see me run, run, run baby.   Run fast if you can  I'm gonna get you anyway  There's nowhere to hide baby.  Breathe in, breathe out!  It's almost over now oh baby. (2x)   Don't you recognize  This hardened heart of mine  Waiting to be found.  Lying on the ground,  Never will it grow  Till it make you stumble and fall.  I loved you the way I know  But you fit me back  Right in your pleasure glove,  Watch me now,  Don't underestimate  Coz you never ever see me run, run, run baby.   Run fast if you can  I'm gonna get you anyway  There's nowhere to hide baby.  Breathe in, breathe out!  It's almost over now oh baby. (2x)   You taught me things  I never dreamed to be  Now your down on your knees  Begging me please to spare you,  How I wish I could  But darling cant you see  It's a little bit too lateâ¦  Run fast if you can  I'm gonna get you anyway  There's nowhere to hide baby.  Breathe in, breathe out!  It's almost over now oh baby. (2x)  (Guitar Solo)  Run fast if you can  I'm gonna get you anyway  There's nowhere to hide baby.  Breathe in, breathe out!  It's almost over now oh baby. (2x)
