Cris has no idea how to score, frankie lacks of confidence and myself dunno how to approach the questions, even the MCQ.. i still need 17+ marks to pass.. God Bless me.. 17% for me is like Mission Impossible.. Imagine like I can take a UFO back home in the next minute.. miracle.. well.. shower time then come back n torture my mind again..

      How ah How? Keep asking myself this question whole day long.. How ah How?? This morning right after exam Michael asked me what's my answer for Question 3.. in return I asked him what's question 3 all abt.. He said chargor n chargee.. But until now oso I cannot recall the questions in exam..   Too tensed and many unhappy things happened this two weeks, glad that Meimei sometimes called and comfort me.. and oso Jasmine oso spends time talking to me..   I losT my appetite~ Hardly eat anything these days, fall in deep depression~ trying to be strong = ^ ~ ^ = well trying to Get Over everything, it's damn hard but I cannot give up trying..  Last nite discussed the law finance with Mike, half way through I asked him Mike wat's the time now? He said 11:10pm.. I thought only 9pm.. In me the time passes so slowwwww.. so so slow.. every single minute is a torture for me.. hey tears can u please hide inside my eyes and dun suddenly come out.. damn u  Deep Pain~ but who cares? MeiMei.. ^ _ ^ she is the only 1 who is always there.. She luvs me .. I oso luv her.. oso abalone~  Even doing the exam, he is still inside my mind~ shook my head and continued doing.. Came back home lied on bed.. tears just came out by its own.. I thought I oreadi numb but my tears still quite active.. haha (sarcastically)  I can make it.. just need a little more of time~

      All alone I have started my journey  To the darkness of darkness I go  With a reason, I stopped for a moment  In this world full of pleasure so frail  Town after town on I travel  Pass through faces I know and know not  Like a bird in flight, sometimes I topple  Time and time again, just farewells   Day by day,my story unfolds  All alone as the day I was born  Till your eyes rest in mine,I shall wander  No more darkness I know and know not  For your sweetness I traded my freedom  Not knowing a farewell awaits   You know, hearts can be repeatedly broken  Making room for the harrows to came  Along with my sorrows I buried  My tears, my smiles, your name   Songs of lovetales I sing of no more  Once again with my shadows I roam  I love you All alone as the day I was born  I love you Still alone with my shadows I roam

        I'm sorry I didn't mean to call but I couldn't fight it I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it and so I surrender just to hear your voice I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live with out you and maybe someone else is standing there beside you but there's something baby that you need to know that deep inside me I feel like I'm dying I have to see you it's all that I'm asking. Vida, give me back my fantasies the courage that I need to live the air that I breathe carino mio, my world becomes so empty my day's are so cold and lonely and each night I taste the purest of pain. I wish I could tell you I'm feeling better every day that it didn't hurt me when you walked away but to tell you the truth I can't find my way and deep inside me I feel like I'm dying I have to see you it's all that I'm asking
