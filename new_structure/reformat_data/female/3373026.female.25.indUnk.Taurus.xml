She would certainly be better than what's his face. I mean, a Â¨War on GlovesÂ¨ makes more sense than a Â¨War on TerrorÂ¨. At least gloves actually EXIST as concrete objects that can be Â¨defeatedÂ¨! I mean GOD, how can you declare war on a CONCEPT or an emotion!? Terror... oi vay. I will now yield the floor to my collegue, Mr. Hat, the gentleman from Tasmania. He is here to talk about the war his son has declared on the monsters that live under his bed. THAT makes more sense than the Â¨War on TerrorÂ¨ too. urlLink
