       My friend told me about this and at first I thought it was cool for some people, but not for me. Well, I realized that I can't keep going through this cycle of all of my feelings and emotions. Not that I don't have a great family and awesome friends that listen, but somehow it doesn't completely help. I feel like I am on this non-stop rollercoaster of emotions. One of my main problems is that I can never hate anyone. No matter what they do to me, if I ever cared about someone, they can do no wrong. Which really sucks because no matter what they do I somehowfind the good in their actions. This makes it so I can never let go. In my current situation, nothing was ever wrong. My boyfriend always made me feel like I was a queen. He put me on a pedestal and did everything right. He was so respectful and sweet. I never felt so loved and so special in my life. I didn't take him for granted either. I was always doing sweet little things for him as well. Then one day he out of the blue broke up with me. And from there I feel likeI have done everything wrong. I've tried to hold on, I've tried to let go. No matter what I still feel the love. I try to tell myself to let it go, but it is the one thing I believe in and then I smile again because I belive in something. Thus the cycle of up and down emotions starts again. Since the break up I haven't just been moping or anything. In fact I've been more social and outgoing than ever. But I am getting to a point where I am tired of it. I want to just feel OK in staying home one night and not having to worry about thinking of everything. Bcause that's what happens when I am alone. I think, and think and think and think until I drive myself to tears or else a gallon of icecream. I still love him, I do. And I know it was all real, I could see it and feel it and I know he did too. So what the hell happened?
