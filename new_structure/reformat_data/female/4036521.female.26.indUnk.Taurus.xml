      Ants are taking over my world.  Literally.  They are in the kitchen.  They are in the damn FREEZER!  They crawl into my cereal boxes, my stove, and in my bathroom.  What could they possibly want in my bathroom??  Ants are moving in, and Iâm about ready to move out.  I canât stand it anymore!  The Orkin guy comes and sprays the house, and it smells like Raid for about 20 minutes (uck) and itâs only effective for, oh, say, about AN HOUR.  Then theyâre back.  And theyâre pissed.  I think if I could look at them with a microscope they would have sneery little faces and would more than likely be giving me the finger.  The Orkin guy sagely tells us, âThese ants are not the same ants that your parents had to deal with.  These ants are much more aggressive.â  Um.  Bionic ants with attitude?  Gimme a helmet and a blowtorchâ¦ Iâm going to work.  Iâve been sewing up a storm lately.  I made an outfit (peasant shirt and shorts) for Marissa, a baby sling and matching changing pad (custom order from an eBay customer) and another sling to put up for auction.  I also got Boy a rad boxer-pattern, and let him pick out some material.  He chose a fabric with, ahem, male roosters all over.  Weâre calling them his Bock Coxers.  The lady at the fabric counter frowned at our sophmoric snickering, but WE really got a kick out of it.  So I made them, and my sister had friends over, and Boy proceeded to pull his pants down (in a very discreet way) to show all her friends his new undershorts.  As long as heâll wear themâ¦.  â¦  Anywho, Boy and I are seriously contemplating home-schooling Marissa this year.  I think it would be a challenge, but Iâm warming up to the idea.  I really need to do more research before we can make an informed decision, but Iâm kind of excited at the prospect.  She goes/went (itâs summer vacation) to a Montessori in the next town over.  It is/was good, but now sheâll be starting 1st grade, and Iâm not too impressed with their upper-level education.  When the kids are little the school follows Montessori pretty well (independent learning, working at their own pace, etc.) but as they get older itâs just like public school.  They learn one thing and move on to the next.  I suppose thatâs the practical way to do it, but why would I shell out $400 per month for her to get the same education there that she could get at a public school for free?  The class size is smaller at Montessori, and she would get more individual attention, but thatâs part of the benefit of home-schooling as well.  So, itâs an idea in the works right now.  Iâm sure Marissaâs dad (my ex-husband) would probably have a fit, but Iâll cross that bridge when I come to it.  I guess thatâs all for now.  Nothing too exciting has been happening around here lately (unless you count my sisterâs cat pooping repeatedly behind the couch âexcitingâ, in which case weâre having a BLAST!).  My dadâs coming to visit tomorrow, though, and once he sees how Iâve successfully managed to kill half his lawn Iâm sure Iâll have many many things to say.

      Today has been no fun at all so far.  Talked to AFLAC.  My employer still hasnât sent them the âemployer formâ.  So although I filed my claim on APRIL 26TH they still havenât processed it.  I sent them a nasty letter.  I officially hate AFLAC.  I tried to call my employer to find out whatâs going on (because Iâm pretty sure she wouldâve sent the paperwork) and sheâs not in today.  That sucks.  So then I called EDD about the Paid Family Leave that Iâm supposed to be getting, that was supposed to take effect on July 8th, and they had âtoo many callersâ and hung up on me.  Iâm supposed to get 6 additional weeks of paid family leave to stay home with my baby, BUT I HAVENâT GOTTEN A CHECK YET AND MY SIX WEEKS ARE UP.  Punks.  So, in light of all these recent monetary set backs, our cell phones got turned off.  And our cable.  And our long distance.  And our house phone.  Yipee!  I got the house line and long distance turned back on, and it looks like Iâm going to have to cash out my 401K to get the cells turned back on.  Cable can suck my toe.  Marissa watches too much t.v. anyway, and I donât watch it hardly ever, so itâs not a big deal.   I was starting to have serious reservations about home-schooling Marissa, and then she told me, âI WANT to go to public school.â  Okay.  Thatâs fine.  So in order to get her registered I have to schedule a physical for her, and make sure her shot record is updated, and bring in a utility bill, and her birth certificate.  School starts September 9th, so we have a little while yet.  I just hope there isnât a huge list of supplies that sheâll need.  Itâs so hot that Iâm sweating like a stuck pig who is sweating bullets.  Iâm sweating so much that my sweat is sweating.  Yesterday we broke down and ran the air conditioner (the thermostat said it was 90 degrees inside).  I had the air set up so that it would shut off at 80 degrees.  It never shut off.  So,weâre packing our bags and moving to Antarctica.  (and did I mention that Marissa and I had the oh-so-bright idea of baking cookies today?  Which means pre-heating the oven?  You know, that contraption that can pretty much warm the house by itself in winter?  Yup.  Weâre obviously not the smartest people to ever walk this earth.)  How much is airfare to Antarctica?
