         The best college for me is one that offers a degree in Culinary Arts or in Pastry Arts, because it is my dream and desirestobecome a chef. I have always like cooking, I love to cook for people, and it makes me happy; I guess you can call it my passion. I am passionate about learning to cook and prepare many different kinds of dishes and desserts. My favorite things to cook are meat, such as pork, steak, chicken and beef. Some recipes I want to try are Cornish Hens Waldorf, Broiled Butterflied Squab chickens and there are some pies I want to make like Mississippi mud pie, peach cobbler, chocolate cheesecake and blueberry pie. I like to watch cooking shows on TV. Some of my favorite shows are Emeril, Saraâs Secrets, Essence of Emeril and a lot of lot here shows Ialso desire to learn to prepare dishes from a diverse mix of cultures and ethnicities. The better my training the more opportunities there will be to help me become a world traveled chef.    The schools I'm most interested in are The Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago (CHIC), The French Culinary Institute New York City (FCI), The Illinois Institute of ArtChicago (AI), Kendall College,OrlandoCulinary Academy (Le Cordon Bleu Culinary program), LeCordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts -Las Vegas, Robert MorrisCollege.    The schoolsI am considering are located in Chicago,New York, Orlando and Las Vegas.The reason I maywant to go to school in Chicago is because it is close to home and my family. Chicago has a lot of job opportunitiesfor chefs. The thing about New York Cityis I don't knowanyonethere, butI do know it is one of the biggest food and restaurant citiesthatI know of. I have always wanted to visit or live there. The reason I want to go to Orlando, Florida is because I want to work at Walt Disney World makingcakes and cooking food forpeople from around the world. The reason I would love to go to school and workinLas Vegasis because there are alot of people having a great time and I want to be aroundhappy and fun people.    In comparing schools, I am looking at whether they have programs in Culinary Arts and Pastry Arts and how long it takes to get a degree. I am looking at class size.I am looking at tuition costs and financial aid available. I'm lookingfor safeand affordable housingor ifI will be able to live off campus.

       picture        this is a picture of me and my family happy because I just graduated fromhigh school and making my to college there because theyknew that I could do it if I just did my work and listen to my teachers. The way I feel in this picture is that I did something most kids don't do because they drop out and don't finish school to do what I have done. When you graduate you feelhappy then you have ever felt before and that feels good. I can say with a smile I'm going to college cause I graduated from high school and going to start my life on my on.
