      There are things I've always wanted to be: A stand-up comic (I'm not that funny) A writer of novels or children's books (I'm better at writing instruction manuals) Famous (without any kind of criticism)  How's that for reasonable? BTW, no one really knows about these "aspirations". I think, for some reason, I would like to be known. I want people to like me and think, "Hey. She's really something. Smart. Funny. Wow!" What I don't want is the ridiculous criticism that comes with fame. Nothing is personal, nothing is good enough. That's why I think writing would be the way to go; when is the last time you saw rags go over what writers are wearing, what their flaws are, etc.? They do a few interviews, sign some books. It is something to capture someone's imagination.  I have always loved details and was fascinated that there was a degree in Technical Writing that allowed me to focus on those details. What is hard for many people comes easily to me (especially with time to edit!). My husband has trouble writing and hates it; I love it (but I can't do math and he can). Since I earned my BA and MA in TW, I've wanted to move into a more creative aspect of writing. As my son begins to read I'm even more interested in writing for children.  I have ideas for books, but as I write them out I am still in my dry, technical writing mode. Nothing I put down would keep a child's attention (or anyone's for that matter). I am not ready to give up. I will keep trying, editing, trying again.

      I've been thinking about movie lines that have defined how we interact with each other. In my family growing up and even now we use lines from different movies to convey what we mean--usually for humor emphasis. Here are some of the ones we use frequently.  Sixteen Candles: "No more yankie my wankie. The Donger need food!" Better Off Dead: "I want my two dollars!" Cats and Dogs: "Not Good!" Jurassic Park: "Unix. I know this!" Meatballs: "Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!" (whispered in an encouraging way) Raising Arizona: "If'n you think circular is funny." "Son, you have a panty on your head." "Turn the right!"  My brother recently used a line from Jaws as his wife (who is 8 months pregnant) got into her car. "You're gonna need a bigger boat."  :D  Love that.  I know there are more because this is the main way my brother and I communicate. However, I'm having trouble remembering them right now. If you think of some, let me know. I'd be interested to know which ones others use.

      My husband returned from a business trip on Friday. Apparently the only thing on the plane worth reading was a Newsweek article about how more and more women are having affairs. The profile is that they are mid-thirties, been married around eight years and have kids. So of course I got the quiz on Juan the Pool Boy when he got home. Forget that we donât have a pool or even a koi pond in the backyard. I hardly think I can talk Juan into coming in to clean my inflatable kiddie pool. And once heâs there, I doubt heâd stay; the sight of me in my skirtini is not what Iâd consider stunning or erotic.  But the whole conversation got me thinking. All I need is for Matt Damon to realize what heâs missing by globe-trotting and making movies instead of living in my smallish walk-in closet as my boy toy. I mean really. What DOESNâT a 33-year-old housewife who is happily married with two kids have to offer? Iâm smart, have a dry wit, and Iâm clean. He wants me, he just doesnât know it yet. Letâs look at the facts:   Weâre the same age.  His middle name is Paige, my daughterâs middle name is Paige.  Heâs handsome, my husband is handsome. I like handsome.  The connection is so clear.  In  The Bourne Identity  Matt Damon is quite adept at wiping down a room. I can use that. You see, when I say âboy toyâ you may have the wrong idea. If Iâm going to have an affair, Iâm going to have to make it worth my while. My idea of a boy toy is Matty in an apron, holding a mop, and making sure my entire house sparkles. My girlfriends will oooooh and aaaaaah over my ability to juggle it all. âHow on earth can you juggle the kidsâ activities, a clean house, cooking, and still have time to read?â theyâll ask. Iâll answer, âMy dears, itâs all in the management style.â

      My brother and his wife just had their first baby last week. Itâs very exciting. They live in Hawaii, though, so we canât see the baby. They named him Trevor John. Iâve seen pictures and he is an absolute doll. My husband has been traveling a lot so we almost have enough for a Delta ticket to Hawaii. Iâm trying to figure out the best way to use that. I could go by myself, give the ticket to my mom or my dad to go, or see if Travis would use it to bring the baby to us. The problems with any of those scenarios are myriad.    If I go by myself, I have to find someone to watch my kids for a week. You canât just hop over to HI and not stay for a week. Plus, Iâll have to listen to everyone whine about not getting to go. They would be forgetting that Travis would be at work and Iâd be at home with Brandi by myself all day. My job would be cooking and cleaning, not playing with Trevor. Iâd have midnight feeding duty. It is by no stretch of the imagination what I would call a vacation.   If I go, I feel guilty because Iâm just the aunt. Iâm not the grandma or grandpa. Iâm very close to my brother, but Iâm still low man on the totem pole.   If I give the ticket to my mom, I feel guilty that I didnât give it to my dad. And vice versa. I canât hide the fact that I gave one of them a ticket and not the other one. It will come out somehow. And it wonât be pretty. My family  lives  for passive-aggressive behavior.   If I give the ticket to my brother he has to come over by himself with the baby or pay for another ticket for Brandi to come too. I canât imagine he would come without Brandi. Heâd miss her, yes, but more importantly he needs her to be the primary care giver for the baby. (And donât get your panties in a wad over what you consider to be a sexist comment. If youâre a mother you understand, if you arenât, you donât. Yes men help, but itâs the mother the kidsâespecially babiesâreach for.) Once they get to the contiguous US they have to choose where to stay. Will it be Oklahoma with me and within easy access for my mother, thus forcing my dad and his wife to drive 12 hours to see him? Or will they choose Colorado to stay with my dad and Brandiâs mom forcing us to drive with my mother for 12 hours? They canât split their time between OK and CO because that would entail another plane trip or an insufferably long (rental) car ride with a baby. I donât see a winning option here.    Letâs not forget that my brother is a Marine and time off is scarce. My parents are both teachers as is my dadâs wife, so their time off is also limited.  Of course, when asking my friends, they respond with the sound reason that Bill and I earned the ticket and therefore should use the ticket. I am not responsible for making sure my parents fly to Hawaii to see their third grandchild. My friends forget that I am a pleaser raised with a good dose of Catholic guilt (which Iâm almost over). More importantly, though, is the fact that if I donât give my mother the ticket Iâm going to pay for it in spades until she gets to see the babyâand even then itâs iffy. Sure, I can go to Hawaii and just enjoy the scenery and my new nephew, but at what price?
