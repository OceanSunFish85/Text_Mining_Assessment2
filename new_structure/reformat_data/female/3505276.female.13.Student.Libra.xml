      Wo...this is my first online diary?! So perhaps i might wanna give it a name so it sounds more...sweet...this is my teddy bear's name too!  Dear Brownie,           Hmm...went to watch The Day After Tomorrow with mummy,wow it was WONDERFUL! It can be counted as one of the best movies i ever watched.The effects are certainly better than what i was anticipating!Hehe...long time never went to take a break le...went to Orchard Road Shaw House ...the night view is certainly pleasant and sort of romantic yar.Now then i know the journey is not that long! So perhaps mummy shall take me to Orchard Road occasionally? Then with my friends we go Shopping too!          Then just came back from Science Centre from the LORD OF THE RINGS EXHIBITION,it was marvellous too.Wow,these few days are sure  MOVIE days.The exhibition showed the unique clothes and the weapons as seen in the movie,although i don't really like the movie,i still give thumbs up because i also learned some effects of how they do the movie!Today was a fruitful and learning day!         Yeah...just now went to play soccer with my siter,it was tiring!Cux that idiot sis kept on scaring me with the dog and seems that the cat and the dog became so good friends and trying to make me jump at my own shadow!HAHA..lalala...well that's all Brownie! :D

      Yoz...now i am planning for tomorrow ...cux i dont know wat to do tomorrow ...go to the sch lib and meet up with they all?The thought of this makes me sad...they seem to be drifting away further and further away from me...yes...it's happening...cause we have different interests-as in different point of view of society...they want guys-meet guys,fun during class,and i don;t know how to describe. WS had been my best friend she was a wonderful gal,she has what it takes to be a very good friend.The type i had been searching but yet other took her away.Not to be too blunt,it's that i was the one who had not been matching with her? I'm not that sure.I still have my other friends right? Do i have to be like that? No...i'm still satisfied.It's alright with me...Look on the bright side of life...  It's just that i have one shopping campanion less.Still,it made a great difference,a shopping campanion like her ...as i am a great shopper...always looking for excitement must go out one...my other friends always have no time for me to shop with...they are sort of 'workaholics' or they are spending their time on Idol dramas. haiz.not that i am backstabbing them but it's just that i have to go out alone...thinking of getting a boyfriend?...will there be a day that comes...hope so...but i shall have to love myself alot first...yea~wateva then  My passion is music rite? yea...now trying to figure out 'piano'...anyhow play one la~ still can play bits here and there :P ...woo....  Argh...pimple poke out again! SObS! y everytime like that one...i wanna grow taller! hmm...maybe by this year grow till 163?...or at least 160 cm pls god...lala...  Ewww...a mole on the eye meaning attractive? hehe...i have that...but am i attractive? Not so ?...agrees...  Your Life You never live your life in the way others want you to. You are an independent individual who loves challenges and excitement. You are ready to face with the result of your decision. You are usually the one your friends count on. Your Love Because you love excitements, you occasionally get involved in forbidden love affairs. You may fall in love with a married person and no one can stop you from making progress. You are very charming, although you might not realize it.  hoo...think all these really somewhat reveals the true self of me...haha...quite true though..i think    luv brownie bear bear :P

      Dear dear brownie                  today nothing...? Went to jurong east to walk about in the Cd Shop and splurged money to buy Fan Fan's latest cd...now no money ...how am i going to survive? So also no money to eat lunch so just bought a 70 cents bread...Maybe i should save more cux now i spent more money nowadays on shopping.                  okay...then went bm library orhz...as jurong's is opening only in 5th june...borrowed one chinese book on youth hehe...it talks about the life of a youth-romance,ignorance,etc...then went to band. Just another blowing day,preparation for Macritchie Performance,haiz 2 seniors never come.When J come,X neva come and vice versa~.Y was sick!Again?~take care...nowadays many ppl sick ...perhaps of weather?n that reminds me of The day after tomorrow! i wanna watch it again n again! Maybe i buy the VCD? i Saw the Book in Kinokuniya! still,the movie is better than book right...hehe never mind...                  Yea`reached home at 5 pm...tired...listening to FanFan's Cd...Superb...it's full of heart-felt songs. Full of emotions,other cds only talk about Romance but this talks most of happiness in life like angel and dream ...Zhui Chu De Mong Xiang! And i like singers who compose songs themselves...rather than like some "ppl" only depend on looks n sing horribly yet proud? Lolx...i wanna be a wonderful musician! Can i? i wait... i shall compose n pen my own lyrics yea...~                       I really can't express very well how much i luv music,why?i Dunno...Perhaps perhaps perhaps...Maybe because some songs are ways of communicating and heart-felt themes...Describes my feelings and mood and life...Though,it's some sort of weird? not weird i should say...it's because i seems to like music my friends don't...they like Jolin,Jay..lalala...haha ....and i dun really...it's okay la.                 Hmm...kinda hot now...drink water? Yea i should cux jus now drank lots of soft drink must use pure water to replace...later got diabetes?   kekeke...lolx!                  Tomorrow i stay at home and slack...yea cux these few days quite busy orhz then no time to rest...today i met the neighbour's friend again...we dunno each other..he's bout my age? not sure or perhaps younger than me...but he always has the weird sight when seeing me come out of lift n that's where i always see him...opps..?No nothing...prefer guys taller than me hehe lala! Ok ok...continue to pursue my dream! :D                 *gave brownie a kiss on the nose*
