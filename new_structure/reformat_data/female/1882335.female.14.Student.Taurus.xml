      This template is only a filler.  I'm working on something for it later, but not right now.  I'm too lazy and lack the motivation right now.  Ugh.  Ericka

      It's Ericka.  I've decided to create a blog in which I will keep track of such daily things as eating, speaking, whatever, really.  And when school comes around, it will show my studies and things, with the things I don't understand.    I have no clue why I'm starting this, lol.  It's just a whim for the day.  Ericka

      I'm not eating for a week. 0 calories for a week! I'm drinking water and only water. Nothing else.   My goal is a size 2 or less. Not stopping 'til I get there. Don't try to stop me.   hearts;Ericka

      Ate some stuff today, feel like puking it all up.  It's not just my brain that wants to.  My body wants to too.    Seriously.    Ugh, too lazy to do a layout.  What I'm working on is exercising my muscles for swimming.  I'm semi-bulimic as well as semi-anorexic?  Is that possible?  X.X  Ericka
