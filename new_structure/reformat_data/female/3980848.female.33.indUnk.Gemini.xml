          Thought the heat was never going to end. I felt so sick yesterday from all the humidity and 90 degree weather. The kids were cranky, I was cranky, and things were not good.   Today, it is a cool 71 degrees with low humidity. A perfect day to go to the fair again. I hope we have better luck than we did wednesday. Leaving for Mom's after the kids have lunch then going out to the fair when Dad gets off work. The kids are with J. right now getting his check and going to the bank. I should be taking advantage of this FREE TV time. Maybe I should take a nap.....         H. emailed to say she's not coming to Indiana this summer. Now I feel bad because we were going to try and make plans to go to MO to see her. Maybe we can find time this fall.....      Have to decide on what to take to the reunion on Sunday.....I am sooooo not into this. What really pisses me off is that J's brother and sister won't even TRY to come up for it so we HAVE to go.....

       Pthththththdddd...... :0P J's at the offce (or not) working. It DID get him off the golf course. *SNICKER* Thought for sure we were going to get blown away.....my palm plant on the front porch almost bit the big one.        A nice day with the kids at Mom's. Went to the county fair with T. Ate some eggroll, some Greek spinach pie with rice, some fried cheddar. GAWD....it's no wonder I have weight issues. Add to that a chocolate mint mocha icee......ICK! C., of course, wanted to ride the carnival rides. HA!!!! Me no think so, grasshoppa..... Got back to my parents' around 1:30 then swam in T's pool for an hour or so. Loaded up the kiddos and headed home. I. slept part of the way. Wish C. would do that---what a chatter box.        Really tired now but hate trying to sleep with out J. here. Guess I better go try anyway. My eyes are itching like crazy and my throat is scratchy.....that can't be good.     How the heck do you post fave links on this thing?

       Here I am.....checking the weather website again. Of course, it's not really telling me anything. Certainly not what it will be doing at 8:30 tomorrow morning when it's time to leave or not leave for Mom  Dad's. Part of me is kind of hoping it does rain. I'm not really into the whole County Fair thing if we're going again on Friday. Just doing this for T. and how lame is that?????        Golfed tonight....don't know what my score even was. We played the back 9 again. I guess it's God's way of teaching me that it's not THAT bad. I know that it pays to play with ladies who are better than me. It sure makes me want to not screw up. Of course, it's also nice to play at 4:30 instead of 5:30 or after like with MIL and M.        I really have to go to bed.....I'm sooooo flippin' tired after being up until after midnight.

       I told C. we'd do "homework" today.....I think this is what makes me a crappy mom. I have all these good ideas and never want to take the time to do them. We took some junk to the thrift shop. I went and signed up for a new phone contract and bought a new cell phone. I'm really trying not to think about our financial future right now. Of course, I can also justify all of it by saying I'll use my cell to call Mom and K. instead of calling long distance. Sounds good, right? Also took J's auto-deposit form into the office. It's only taken 11 years to get him to sign up. Answered my mail. I'm going to check the weather for tomorrow.

       Guess that means I made it through Monday.....Had gymnastics last night (I help teach.....i.e. try to keep the girls from killing each other or themselves). J. went to the office to back-up the computerat 7:45. "I'll be back in 15 minutes" which turned into 45 minutes and not having to put C. to bed. Such a big help.....right up there with the 3 beers by the time I got home from gymn. What's wrong with this picture?       I've got a zillion things to do and a bunch of emails to answer. Golf tonight. Mom's tomorrow for the fair. Then the weekly stuff of bills and groceries and the other boring stuff that J. takes for granted.

       GAG!  I'm really tired.....read, "worried".  The poops are getting worse and Mom's got me looking at I. like he's lost 5 lbs and should be in the hospital or something.  Of course, this whole time he's running around like a normal 2 year old yelling about "Bob!" and "Doo!".  He's really not eating very well so that worries me even more.  If I'd know motherhood was going to be so freaky, I would've gotten another dog instead.        C. is running her mouth off non-stop.  Like every other 5 year old on the planet, I'm sure.  She gets as pouty as a 13 year old when she gets in trouble.  Her room needs the bulldozer treatment.  I've been threatening all week to go through all her toys and get rid of the junk but, with all the poop, I just don't have the energy.      Maybe I'll go do the dollar store circuit and go to Cato.....I think I need to get out.

       Sometimes I just feel evil. After the morning I've had, we were leaving the mc d's parking lot and a kid-maybe 14 or 15 yrs old--was crossing the RR tracks. He got ready to cross in front of us and tripped. I actually LAUGHED. How evil is that? I thought to myself "Hate it when that happens in front of people" then let out a gufaw. Evil bad mommy....

       First---J. didn't come home until after 11 last night...fixed robert's breaker, a.c., and helped the dumbass put his motorcycle back together. All this while drinking and smoking, i guess. We didn't get to sleep until after 2am and I just want to die. Mom was here before 9am. Took my car to Laf and it took them 45 freakin' minutes to get what they needed to order a new radio. I'll have to take it back next week to have the new one put in and programmed. We made a quick stop at Hobby Lobby for scrapbook paper. Ryan's for lunch and I. was acting weird. He wouldn't eat. Then he pooped a big ole mess. We went home instead of to the mall and he pooped again. He acted OK but not quite right. Put him down for a nap. Mom left around 3. J came home and left for golf. I. ate a little for supper. C  I were playing in the l.r. when I heard a crash and I. was screaming. I went to calm him down---I guess he bashed his head on the coffee table---and he proceded in puking all over me. I showered then stripped him and gave him a bath. He sat with me until bedtime.       I am soooooo overly tired of all the stupid day-to-day stuff thrown in with J.'s refusing to be around. I know he's stressed at work but give me a f-ing break!!!!!

       First....golf sucked tonight. OK....I got a 62 but that's still not good considering my other scores for this year and the fact that I KNOW I played shitty. On the way home, my phone rings ( I barely heard the damn thing since it's the first time the new one has rang/rung/ringed) and it's J. He needs to go to Robert's house to fix one of his breakers. I flat out asked him if he was lying to me. I'm soooooo sick of this. It only took us a little over 1 1/2 hours to play and that ass starts calling me. It's OK if it takes him and his ass-munch buddies 3 hours to play 9 holes. I stopped at Arby's for a sandwich and moz sticks---which I ate all of---and now I feel like crap.Mom's coming tomorrow. We're taking the kids to Laf. to get my car display checked and do some school shopping for C. I am soooooooo not into this. Then J's got golf tomorrow evening and he may came home at a normal time or he may pull an asshole on me AGAIN! Let's see....should I just throw myself in front of a bus?????

      That means the weekend and Monday.....  J. had the day off for the fair on Friday so we all went to Grandma's and Mom and Dad's. When Dad got off work we all went out to the county fair. It was such a nice day. About 75 degrees with no humidity. Ate junk food. Saw the draft horses. I. and C. got to pet a baby rabbit. I think the lady was hoping to get rid of one of them. I saw a couple girls from High School. Missy B. (who without a doubt has an eating disorder as well as a small baby which just sickens me to no end) and Missy/Crystal (who does at-home lingerie parties and that scares me a little. She has at least 3 kids including the one she had in high school. Oye!) I also saw a bunch of people who looked really familiar but I guess 15 years is pretty much water under the h.s. bridge.  Saturday, Jim went fishing. Came home to clean fish. Left to get rid of remains then neglected to come home. Hmmmmmmm.....any-hoooooo, I tracked his ass down and dropped C. off to fish with him. SO HA!!!! They got home around 8:15.....Sunday, we slept in then went to the family reunion. It was fun and I got to gossip about K  T and M  T with stepmonster and Aunt Sandy. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks they're all lunatics. We didn't get home until after 5:30pm. Got the kids fed and into bed. Watched Secret Window w/ Johnny depp and John turturo. It was pretty good.....of course, I've probably read the story because I had it figured out about 1/2 way through. I watched Butterfly Effect on Saturday and I'm just not sure about that one. I may watch it again if it comes on PPV.  Today was a nothing day. I couldn't get my shit together if I tried. Did aWalmart trip for a few things. Like new undies for J. since his look like he's been using them to wash the car.....Had gymnastics tonight and it wasn't too bad. I can't wait for all these kids to get back to school. I think it wears them out enough that they concentrate at gymnastics. Now, they're just all wired and freaked out. Came home and J. had unloaded the dishwasher and he and C. were folding clothes.....can't help but think something's up.
