       This is my Fantasy stories diary. This is a set of stories about four Fairies who have been put onto earth and had their memories erased to live life as normal humans. They look exactly the same as humans and act the same, but they are fairies inside, and if they knew that they were, their wings would grow back and they could return to their kingdom.   Characters:   Katrina -Very Knowledgable and Intelligent. She has straight long black hair with a side fringe and green eyes. She is tall and slim.  Melody -She is the typical 'Bitch' of the group. She is generally nice but has a nasty streak. She has straight medium length blonde hair and Blue eyes. She is slim and medium height.  Grace -Beautiful personality. Grace is the caring one of the group. She has straight medium length light brown hair and Blue eyes. She is medium height and is average build.  Columbine - She is the quiet one of the group. She has short, dark brown curly hair and brown eyes. She is small and average build.   Episode 1- Heaven &amp;amp; Hell.   Katrina walks softly, barefoot along the grey stone pathway in her long white flowy dress blowing in the wind. She tiptoes every so often and acts as if she is balancing. She stops and turns around to look at Grace, Columbine and Melody .  Katrina : âDo you really think that there is a heaven and earth?â  Grace looks up from making a daisy chain and looks at Katrina.   Grace : âMaybeâ¦I donât think anyone is completely sureâ.  Melody : â Yeah, but I think there is, otherwise how would the whole concept of the Satan and God arise?â  Katrina : âYeah, I suppose, but maybe someone just made the whole thing up and started saying they were God or Jesus or even Satan or something? Youâll never know I guessâ¦â  Columbine climbs onto the willow tree and starts climbing until she reaches a big branch in the middle of the tree.   Melody : âBe careful Col, you might fall and hurt yourself. Actually, wait! If you fall and die, you might go to heaven or hell, then you can haunt us and tell us if they are real!â.  Melody, Katrina and Grace all giggle and all sit down together underneath the tree.   Columbine : âHAHA! Your SO funny!â¦Notâ¦ If I did fall you would feel really guilty I bet!  Grace : âProbably, but it would answer our question!â  Melody :â Yeah, you should feel proud if you died, youâd be relieving Katâs mind of a question that is very valuable!â  Katrina : â But we donât want her to die though just to answer a stupid question that we will all know the answer to sooner or laterâ.  Columbine sighs and climbs down the tree, hurting her bare foot on the branch.   Columbine : âOww! I think youâve put a Jinx on me!â  Melody : â Donât be silly, Jinxâs are so fake. Come on, your not superstitious are you?â  Columbine gives Melody an evil glare as they all stand up and walk down the pathway.
