      what i'm listening to:  syd barrett - opel  feel i may be levelling out, and i hope so.  worked one day last week.  thats going to wreak havoc on my bank account, especially since its sketchy from one day to the next whether or not they will let you take a sick day, or if you even fucking have any.  at this point, im trying not to care, you know make like a duck?  ive been working on my yahoo groups shit, but with yahoo groups for some reason, its up 30 minutes, down three hours.  up an hour, down for five.  ridiculous.  im trying to get all my shit off there and move it to my own server so it at least bears some resemblance to being reliable.  much more so than yahoo.  i've also been working on my art again.  computer generated of course, as i don't have enough room in this tiny room of mine to put my easel and paints.  my kids have that shit right now.  talked to my grandma tonight, since i have tues-thurs off the first week of august, weve planned a little vacation.  going to houston to the space centre and a little bit of sightseeing around.  havent been there in ages and thinking the kids will enjoy it.  a diversion would be extra nice :-)  what was that?  a smile?  there's hope for me yet.  my parents broke up, i just found out this weekend.  it sucks, man.  they've been together for what fifteen years?  i told my stepmom that i didnt care, she will always be my stepmom no matter what happens with her and my mom.  yep i have two moms.  that was a lot of fun at catholic school lol.  its getting really fucking late.  but im not really sleepy.  so im sitting here writing and waiting to see if yahoo groups comes back up.  no im not obsessive at all.    i just really have to say that im grateful my mom just let me fall apart and didnt get angry or yell at me.  she just listened when i had to rant and didnt judge me.  that felt good.  of course it may be a different story when i get my paycheck...  i think i may go back and make another picture.  my hairs too wet to go to bed yet anyway......

      what i'm listening to: pink floyd-saucerful of secrets   which is appropriate for how i'm feeling right now. i missed work today (oh damn) but only because i didn't wake up until 9pm. then promptly went back to sleep. fuck it. i've tried staying awake but it's not really working for me. all i want to do is fucking sleep. which is good, cause when i sleep i don't have to think. thinking is rather painful for me, and before the smoke-ears bit starts i don't mean like that. i mean the crazy shit that comes into my head. i'd much rather not think it. too frightening to think about.   i murdered my sims today. that was fun. i'm sure this classifies me as somewhat sick, but i invited the entire neighbourhood over for a party and then fenced them in my backyard, and laughed while they couldn't figure out how to get out. they deserved it. they pissed me off.   oooooohh, scary. lol   pretty soon the grim reaper came and took them away and i was left with a bunch of groovy tombstones. i've been told that sims that die end up haunting you, but i've yet to be revisited.   i've been busying myself lately with trying to keep out of trouble. not going as well as i'd hoped. i got bored and dyed my hair red and black. that was interesting. boredom for me is not good, especially if coupled with free time. i'm bored all the time now. work bores me greatly. i really don't want to be there anymore. i'm only there because i have to be, cause if i don't work, you know don't eat, don't pay rent.all the usual bullshit. not that i'm worried about eating anyway. i can hardly eat anything. i tried to drink the other night, cause i really needed the alcohol, i needed to not feel anything but drunk at that exact moment in time. well, it felt like fire, and i started puking pretty soon afterwards. not projectile vomiting but the way i've always done, just a bit up in the mouth. and it felt like tea leaves. so i told my mother this, and she said oh boy sounds like you have an ulcer. great. just what i always wanted.   so not only am i falling apart mentally (had to be sedated last night because i started freaking out) but also physically. i know i need to go to the doctor, but i can't afford it and my health insurance though this job is about as desirable as the wage... in other words, i may as well have none at all. you know i feel bad when i don't even feel like picking up my guitar. my guitar is like another child to me, and i try to spend as much time with her as absolutely possible, but just haven't felt like it.   my son just turned 10, holy shit. i feel as if i'm getting old, and the unfortunate bit is that there's no way to stop it. well there is one way to never grow old but i havent thought of that 'solution' since ive had children. i think you know what i mean.   waking up is a chore. going to sleep is much better. maybe i should see how much i can sleep, tomorrow's my day off. i live for those you know.   &gt;edited to add, i almost forgot. i've started with the computer generated artwork (since i cannot get my painting things in this tiny room) ... putting them  urlLink here . suppose i could add the link to the sidebar sometime.

      what im listening to:  ozric tentacles-erpland  isnt it funny when you sit down to type and your mind goes completely blank.  you sit there trying to think about what you want to say and theres nothing coming to you.  well, im at work, unfortunately.  i like my job about as much as i would like to rip all my fingernails out.  but theres not much choise out there.  so i suppose you could say im grateful to at least have a job... even if the pay is about half what this job should be paying, considering all that we do and all the bullshit we put up with, and the sheer frustration alone is enough to drive someone straight to an institution.  some days are good, like today, when the calls arent back to back ... when they are back to back is when the stress builds and pretty soon you just want to set down the headset and fucking walk out.  my life is full of stress anyway, i dont need it in the ten hours a day i am forced to sit here in one place, only allowed to get up three times (two breaks and lunch) through the entire day and only then when i get 'permission' from the 'teech' ... sometimes i feel like im in elementary school here, gotta ask to go take a piss, get a drink of water, its bullshit.  and they give us more and more responsibility but no raise.  even the team leads (read, supervisors) dont get a raise when they go from the floor to the 'good cube' ... utter bullshit.  i havent been feeling well lately, dont know why.  im tired all the time and get dizzy a lot.  been real pukey too, which is weird cause since i was a kid even, id have to be really really sick before i puke.  even when i was pregnant i wasnt sick much.  speaking of which, my oldest will be ten in 12 days ... hard to believe.  homelife sucks right now.  i feel like im walking on eggshells lately.  i just try to stay out of the way.  but it doesnt always work out for me.  i invariably get my head bit off for one thing or another at least once a week, even if its not something i thought was a problem at the time.  on top of that, the fucking dog.  i swear to god im moving if she dont stop shitting in front of the toilet.  why the fuck she cant shit anywhere else i dont know.  of course, she does it cause shes nervous ... problem is i dont fucking care.  i dont want to have to either clean it up or try to position myself around it so i can use the goddamned bathroom.  shes not my dog.  shes a good dog but damn she gets on my nerves, bad.  i cannot stand to be stared out while having dinner.  i cannot stand the stench wafting off her when she comes in from outside.  i cannot stand the barking at every little insect that happens to be flying too close to the house, god forbid the mailman come.  and the more splitting the headache, the louder she fucking barks, and she gets the other in on it too and forget it, your eardrums are wasted.    i finally ordered something on weds that im hoping will do some real good to me once it arrives (im hoping today but not counting on it).  i will definitely write about that later.  ive been doing a bit of experimentation.  the way things are with this so called life right now, ive been looking for ways to escape.  searching for oblivion.  total fucking numbness.  if i dont feel anything, i cant feel bad now can i?    i am getting my kids for the holiday weekend though.  thats a plus.  i dont like going so long without seeing them.  i only get to see them about once a month now, and i really fucking hate it.  i just dont have the energy to drive an hour and a half each way to pick them up and take them back home.  and its killing me ... making it all worse.    well, i have to get to work on some other shit...  so much to do, so little time.
