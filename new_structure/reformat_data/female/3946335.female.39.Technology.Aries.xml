      A while back, I had an idea for a business for myself, and now it is finally happening. I will not say the name of my business here, because my last name is a part of it, but I will tell you what the business is.  A couple of years ago, I started trying my hand at video editing using many different programs. I used our family's own home movies to practice. I learned how to physically get analog footage into a PC, then edit, add music, transitions, and titles. And, I learned how to burn the footage to DVD.  Now that I have some experience under my belt, I am beginning to do it for others. I take peoples old home movies, clean them up, and transfer them to DVD. I believe this is a good business to get into because almost everyone has old home movies that are in need of saving. VHS tapes do not last.  Right now I am working on a project for one of my cousins. I am making her a slideshow with music for her mother's (my great aunt) birthday.   I will not do much advertising because I am already getting work by word-of-mouth. However, I may put up a website in the future. If I do, I will post a link on my blog.  Bye for now...

        I have decided  not to post part 2 of my drug history. The reasons are:     Having that info out there in the world is scary    Writing about it brings back memories that I do not want to revisit    No one is reading this anyway     Now, if I find out #3 is not true and someone out there wants me to post it, maybe I will.(But, you have to ask nicely.)    My niece is here, so I have to get going for now. I'll post more later...

       Did you see Al Gore's speech? I thought it was excellent. Right now I'm watching President Clinton's speech. Man, I miss him.    Will post more tomorrow...

       No. I'm not being paranoid. Something strange is going on around here.    It all starteda couple months ago. Two well dressed men were outside my house. One of them stood at the edge of my property while looking at my house. When I asked what they were doing, they said they were looking at ablack bird. When I asked, "you mean that crow over there?," theyignored me. Then they walked away. I think their car was parked a few houses down.    My fiance  I started noticing clicking noices on our phone recently. It sounds like someone else is on the line.   Today there were two new guys outside my house. One stayed in the car while the other got out  walked, while talking on his cellphone. I didn't see where he went. A few minutes later, he got back in the car and they drove away. The car was awhite 4-door sedan,but not a cop car.   The Republicans may be up to theirdirty tricks again. They may be keeping an eye on outspoken liberal Democrats like me. The (unamerican) Patriot Act may be giving them all thetools they need to accomplish this.The ridiculous Republicans probably find these things threatening:     I've purchased anti-Bush books fromAmazon.com  I have donated several times toJohn Kerry For President  I have a John Kerry sign on my house  I am a member of MoveOn.org  I am a card carrying member of the DFL and the ACLU  I have sentfaxes and email to members of the Senate  I have signed numerous petitions for progressive causes  I havethis blog  I havea "The Road To Hell Is Paved With Republicans" bumper sticker on my truck  I've seen Fahrenheit 9/11  I own the other three Michael Moore documentaries  I will talk to whomever will listen about how the Cheney/Bushsyndicate is the worst "administration" in our country's history    I could go on  on...   So, if anyone is having similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it (unless this blog goes down mysteriously.) Feel free to comment on this post.

       It's been 24 hours since I posted part1, and I'm a little nervous. Although no one (that I know of) is reading my blog, it is still scary to know that this info is out there in the world.    I've decided to take a light-hearted break before I post part 2.   I'm looking forward to watching Big Brother 5 tonight. I'm hoping that one of the meathead jocks do not get HOH (head of household.) I hate those guys.  I watched the films "Wonderland"  "The Butterfly Effect" the other day. They were both good in their own ways, but Wonderland was better. Val Kilmer is a great actor.   Part 2 may be posted tomorrow...we'll see.

      When I was indrug treatment, the counselors used to tell us about the statistics. They said that women that do not get  clean  by age 30,have almost no chance of beating their addiction. I made it by the skin of my teeth.   Iwas a textbook drug addict. I startedsmoking pot at age 14. Bythe time I graduated high school, I was smoking it everyday.During that time, I took LSD/mushroomsmany, manytimes. By age 18, I moved on to bigger ( not better) things.I started snorting cocaine. I dropped the marijuana  stayed loyal to coke for another year or so.The part I didn't know was the reason I was doing this. I was clinically depressed I was using drugs to self-medicate.  When I was a kid, I was very afraid of needles. That fear was long gone by age 19 whenIstarted shooting coke on a semi-regular basis. But, with coke, there was one major problem - having to come down.When the money ran out  the drugs were gone for the night, the feeling of depression would be 1000 fold.   All of this was leading up to the big one. The drug that would become my whole life. The drug that took me from a contributing member of society to a thieving, sometimes homeless, suicidal, family-estranged, diseased junkie.   More to come...

       I've heard that the best way to get in Google's search results is by good  linkage . The more sites that link to you, and the moreyou link to others, the higher your site gets ranked.     Theseare some of my favorite websites in the political vein:    Michael Moore:  urlLink http://www.michaelmoore.com   Al Franken /Air America Radio:  urlLink http://www.airamericaradio.com/pub/globalDefault.htm   Jim Hightower:  urlLink http://www.jimhightower.com/   MoveOn.org:  urlLink http://www.moveon.org/front/     Other:   urlLink http://www.toostupidtobepresident.com/    urlLink http://www.markfiore.com/animation.html      and, for the motherload:    urlLink http://www.linkcrusader.com/anti-bush.htm    Something to really think about:   urlLink http://www.alternet.org/story/14399        That's enough to get you started!

      Idon't get it. How can the polls be so close? Sure, Kerry is slightly ahead, but why only  slightly ?  I know that people are loyal to their chosenpolitical parties, but there has to be a point when you realize that your elected (or in this case "selected")officials are no longer worthy of that loyalty. So, what is it? Are the Bushites brainwashed, or are they the largest group of ignoramuses that ever lived? Come on people - WAKE UP!!Look at what your belovedCommander in Thief has done.Unless you're a war profiteer, are you truly better off than you were 4 years ago? Or are you like the rest of us that can't deny the feeling of impending doom. THAT is the legacy of this "president."   The saddest part is that this administration has done SO much damage to us, and the rest of the world, that even if Kerry does win, he won't be able to begin to undo the damage. It is going to take decades, or longer.

       Personally, I don't find having OCD a bad thing. If I were to be treated for it, I don't think I would get as much done.        I was diagnosed with OCD a couple of years ago. Looking back over my lifetime, I believe I was born with it. I think my Grandpa had it, so it must be in my genes. It manifests itself in just about everything I do. From rotating the towels, silverware, glassware, soft drinks, etc, to checking  rechecking the locks on the house, to organizing  reorganizing everything, to always having a bottle of Windex nearby, to hair pulling, it can be exhausting. I think it's the hardest on my fiance, Tom. I tend to drive him a little crazy.     OCD seems to be the "it" disorder these days, if that's possible. TV shows like the excellent, "Monk," and movies like "As Good As it Gets" brings it out into the light. I find that comforting.  There are many celebrities with it such as Donald Trump, Harrison Ford, Cameron Diaz, Roseanne, Billy Bob Thornton, and the late great, Warren Zevon.   Gotta take the dogs out. I'll write more later.

       I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night with my fiance, sister, her daughter, and her daughter's friend. I have seen all of MM's films, and all I can say is WOW. He continues to be the most brilliant  importantdocumentarian of our time. This film is a must-see.   I knew the Cheney/Ashcroft/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz/Rowe/BushSr, and to a MUCH lesser extent, Jr, was the most corrupt administration in our country's history, but I never knew to what extent. I do now. Not only doesthis administration need to go, but in my opinion, they need to be prosecuted for war crimes.   I'll post more later.

      Hello world! My name is Liz. I was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1965. My family moved to a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1967.After living in the same house for many ofmy 39 years, I am now here to stay (I think.)My parents passed away, and I was left with our house.    I bet you're thinking, who cares! I just want to know about the title of this blog. I will get into it more over the upcoming days  weeks. For now, I will say that yes, I have OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder.) I was born in 1965, making me a part of generationX (those born between the early 60's  the mid 70's.)And lastly, I am a VERY proud liberal. I am making it my mission to reclaim the word "liberal." Over the last several years, the Republicans have tried to turn being a liberal into being a bad thing.    Here is the definition of liberal from Dictionary.com:    a. Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.  b. Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded.      Now, can someone tell me what's wrong with beingtolerant,broad-minded,  free from bigotry? Ok, I will say this, Iam intolerant of some people...for instance, the ignorant, the unintelligent, and the close-minded among us.        I don't want my blog entries to be too long, so I will close for now.   Have a wonderful Friday, and I'll "talk" with you again soon.        Sincerely, Lizzy

       My Uncle Richard emailed me this joke:      A Senate staffer is taking a stroll around Capitol Hill when he meets a little girl carrying a small basket with a blanket over it. Curious, he says to the girl, "What's in the basket?"      She replies, "New baby kittens" and opens the basket to show him.      "How nice," he said.       "What kind are they?" Little girl says, "Republicans."      He smiles and pats the little girl on the head and he continues on.      About three weeks later, he and another member of the Senate staff are again strolling on Capitol Hill when he sees the little girl again with the same basket. He says to his colleague; "Watch this, it's very cute" and they approach the little girl.      He asks the girl how the kittens are and she says fine. He then says, "What kind of kittens are they?" and she replies, "Democrats."      Somewhat abashed, he says, "Three weeks ago you said they were Republican!"      "I know," she says. "But now their eyes are open".

      I went to IKEA today to look for new light fixtures. I didn't buy any, but I had a good experience none-the-less. I was wearing my anti-Bush t-shirt, and got a lot of positive reactions. I've been noticing more  more positive signs about the November election. Except for one Bush sign on my block, and a smattering of Bush bumper stickers here  there, for the most part all I see is major support for Kerry - yeah!!  However, there was one news item this week about Kerry that irked me. He was asked: knowing what we know now about Iraq, would he still go to war...he said yes.  Yes?! I doubt that he thought that answer through. I think he was worried about the ignorant red-neck vote when he answered that question. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on that one.

      Shouldn't we have our silver jumpsuits and jetpacks by now? Look at any old science fiction movie. When they show the future (usually around 1975) everyone is wearing matching silver jumpsuits and flying around with their jetpack strapped to their back.  I told my fiance that we should get this thing started. We could go get some jumpsuits made and just start wearing them...everyday. Hey, someone has to get this thing started, right?

      I've been watching David Letterman since the very beginning. I've recently noticed that his opening monologue consists of a lot of Kerry bashing. Sure, he jokes about Bush, as well, but there seems to be something behind the Kerry jokes. Next time he has a political guest on his show, listen to his questions. Last night while interviewing Tommy Franks, his questions seemed to lean to the right. I always thought Letterman was an intelligent man...could I have been wrong?  Before Jay Leno took over the Tonight Show, I was a fan. Not anymore. As much as Letterman has been disappointing me lately, I won't change the channel. Leno's whole schtick consists of  taking cheap shots. I don't call that comedy.  Talk to you tomorrow...
