        Well this week has been great!!  Well besides the fact that I was sick Monday and Tuesday.  I hung out with my son all week!!  He is so wonderful!  I dont know what I would do without him!!  He really is the love of my life!!!  Things with Clay are still great but they did get kinda rocky for about a day.  Last night we went to the tat shop and Jason got a kick ass tat.  I will have to take a pic of it and put it on my website.  Then we went back to his house and I stayed the night.  We did not even have sex we just laid there and talked till we fell asleep.  It was really nice.  Today I am gonna go back over there and we are gonna go to the movies to see The Village.  well i am gonna go take a bath now.  I will update more later.  Bye

        I really dont know what I did to deserve all this happiness!!!I guess that since I have had such shitty relationships in the past that I finallydeserve a good one!!I really think that I am falling in love with him!! I have not said it yet cause it is not the time, but I have NEVER felt this strongly before!!! He asked me if I loved him last night and I said kinda so he told me that he kinda loved me too...LOL it was so cute!! We got to come back to my house cause my dad went to Austin to get my mom at like midnight. When we got here we went down to my room and laid there for a while and fell asleep. It was so great to fall asleep in someones arms!!! Then my brother woke us up at like 4 so he could take clay home. :( I wanted him to stay but o-well!!          Today is my bestfriends birthday!!! She is 19!!! It is also my mommy's birthday!! I think that I am gonna make them a cake!!

        Well last night was FUN!!! Actually the whole day was pretty good! I went to work like usual and had a good time with Kyle. I got to meet his girlfriend Alex, she was really pretty. then I came home and cleaned the kitchen so I could leave. Me and Britni went to Clays house to hang out over there, well while we were there Debrah called so we went and got her. When we got back Jason had gone to the store and bought a shit load of alcohol so we drank and played games. Then we decided to go to the playground and play. LOL that was so much fun!! I love to play at the playground. Well clay and I walked over to the ampa-theatre and talked for a while and while we were walking back up to the park he stopped me and said "Danielle do you ever think about me when I am gone?" And I was kinda in shock cause he is on my mind all the time! So I said "OMG Clay I think about you all the time!!" Then he got this huge smile on his face and gave me a hug. Well then I needed to know if he ever thought about me so I asked him and he said "He never stops thinking about me" So I asked him what he thought about and he told me that he wanted to wait till we had more time so he could tell me everything that he thought about so we decided that he would tell me today!!! I am so happy!!! I really dont think that I have ever been this happy before!!! Well I am gonna go change so I can go and see him!!!!

        Well yesterday we went to a show in Humble. It was great!! The best part happened while I was driving on the phone. Jason (clay's brother in law) called me and was like "Danielle when you left Clay could not stop talking about you!! He really really likes you." And you know I get all kinds of Happy!!! Then we got off the phone cause I was in lots of traffic and like 5 mins later he calls back and said "Hey Clay is to shy to ask you but he is right here and he wants to know if you will go out with him." I said that I wanted Clay to ask so Clay got on the phone and asked me!! WOO HOO I am so happy I have really never felt like this before!!! I was talking to Britni last night about the butterflies that you get in your tummy when you really like someone, I told her that with Craig I had them, never had them with Shane, and always have them when I am with Clay!! Well anyways i have to go to work now :( have a great day!!!

        He likes me just as much as I like him!!!! I am so happy!!! Tonight we went out to the Texas City Dike and went to this playground thing. Well Krystle and David were on the swings and Britni, Clay and I were on the slides. Well Clay kept hugging on me and kissing on me all night!! It was great!!! We had to leave after like 20 mins cause Brit had to get home and so did Clay but he walked me to the car and gave me a kiss and a hug :) Well while we were driving Krystle told me that she had asked David if Clay liked me, and David said yea Clay likes Dani a lot!!! He said Clay talks about her all the time!!! I am so happy I have never been this happy before in my life!!! It scares the hell out of me but o-well!! Well it is 2:00 and I am tired but I just had to get all of that out!!! Well bye for now!!

        DAMN!!! I really did not want to like him!!! I did not want to have feelings for him cause I am tired of having my heart ripped to shreds, but I do have feelings for him and now I know that I am running the risk of getting hurt! I told him last night that I liked him and he said he felt the same about me, but I am still scared!!! I hate feeling vunerable like this!!! Well now there is nothing I can do about my feelings!! I mean they are just there...lol I talked to Britni about everything last night and she said that she knew exactly what I was going through! Well Krystle is here and we are gonna go so bye for now!!

        I want this song played at my wedding!!  It is so pretty!!               "Warmness On The Soul"- by: Avenged Sevenfold          Your hazel green tint eyes watching every move I make.And that feeling of doubt, it's erased.I'll never feel alone again with you by my side.You're the one, and in you I confide.And we have gone through good and bad times.But your unconditional love was always on my mind.You've been there from the start for me.And your loves always been true as can be.I give my heart to you.I give my heart, cause nothing can compare in this world to you.
