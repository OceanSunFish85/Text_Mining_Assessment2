       And since I am so forkin' bored, I thought I'd vent for a bit. Until lunch anyway (which I am taking early, and extra-long, by the way). Hangin' a little today. Drank a few too many last night. Oh, well.       So I'm dating this guy, Jim, right? And he lives in Marquette, so, in my eyes, it's nothing too serious. I do really like him, but the 6 1/2 hour drive between us makes it a teeny bit difficult to havea real relationship. So I'm talking to him on the tele the other night, and telling him that I've made the final decision to move to Houghton in June or so of next year. And he proceeds to tell me that when he's working in L'anse, he will be able to come and visit me. Then we're talking about my plans to get a rottweiler soon after moving up there, and he asks me if I'll let him take the dog on occasion. Now this probably seems all sweet and stuff, butI'm not moving for another 10 months, and in all honesty, I'm not sure that our long-distance "relationship" will last that long in the first place. So obviously  he's  in this thing for the long haul; unfortunately for him, I'm not so sure that I am.      I have a feeling I'll be breaking this one's heart at some point... Which sucks, because I really do like him. He's very sweet, treats me like a princess, tells me nice things, refuses to let me pay for anything (I don't let him pay for  everything  though -- I'm not that kind of girl!!).      And I think I'm afraid of commitment on top of it all. I've recently come to the conclusion that I really don't care if I ever get married. Yes, it would be nice to have a pretty diamond ring, but I'd rather just have boyfriends, and get rid of them after they've served their useful purpose. I do want kids, however, which is where things start to get complicated... I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.      Due to this fear of commitment, I manage to find the silliest flaws in guys that I date. Jim, for example, has a funny-shaped head, and this stain-like thing in between his two front teeth (his teeth are absolutely perfect in every other way though, which is important). He also drinks too much (but no more than me), and smokes pot. But the thing is, I think that if I were to tell him he needs to quit drinking or smoking, he would do it, no questions asked. And that, in itself, is a turn-off. A boy needs to have a backbone, for goodness' sake.      But he sure is good to look at. And he's younger than me. And he's an excellent kisser.

       I basically started this blog as a way to vent about the shitty, shitty place that I live right now...      It all started when I graduated from college a year and a half ago. I felt like my next step was supposed to be to move down to Detroit. I know now that I never should have done that, and I was just trying to make my dad happy. That's me, alwaysmore worried about making everyone else happy, and forgetting that, in the end, it's always most important to LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE!!!      So anyway, here I am in Detroit, realizing that had I only wanted to make myself happy, I never would have left the UP. On the bright side of that, though, is that now I know FOR SURE that I do not ever want to live here, ever again. Somewhere along the line, I went from big-city to small-town girl... Who'd've thunk it???    So, my plan is to (behind my dad's back, of course), take the GRE, apply to Michigan Tech, get accepted, and moveto Houghton sometime around June 2005. We'll see what happens... So farI haven't really started preparing yet. Oh, and I need to sell my condo, as well. Which will bedifficult, considering that I am BROKE andneed at least a little bit of money to prepare the damn thing to sell. But that'sanother story for another time.
