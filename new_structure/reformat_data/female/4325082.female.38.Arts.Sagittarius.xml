      So today is the kind of day where I'm really tempted to have a meltdown. People yelling at me for things they don't even understand, people being mean, and on top of it all a gloomy day. But it's not worth it to have a meltdown. Perhaps the best thing is to sit down with a fine whine and some aged sheeze.

      &gt; &gt; Hi Tim, &gt; &gt; I envy your life on the road. Life is so simple out there. I always  &gt; hate coming home from "away". I don't care if it's business or  &gt; pleasure. I've always loved "being elsewhere." I love exploring.  &gt; That's why I'm starting to think that travel photography might just be  &gt; the thing for me. I hadn't thought of photography seriously until I  &gt; realized, early this summer, just how much of it I'm actually doing. I  &gt; love doing it, it's such a natural thing for me to pick up my camera,  &gt; and I'm realizing that I have a good eye for composition. I've got 20  &gt; gigabytes of photos, most of them taken while traveling. Plus I've got  &gt; CDs and negatives that aren't on my computer. It's time to see if I  &gt; can turn my love into cash. &gt; &gt; I might be going down the wrong road trying to write. I might be too  &gt; impatient for that. Photography is such an instant reward. Writing is,  &gt; too, but it comes from inside and you do it alone. Photography  &gt; requires that you interact with the environment, which you can do  &gt; "alone" but you're always looking outside yourself. I think I get more  &gt; energy from that. It's much more stimulating, and it keeps me from  &gt; overanalyzing and introverting into insanity. &gt; &gt; Well, I drove over 1200 miles last week. I didn't know I could do it,  &gt; but it was incredibly easy! It actually seemed easier to drive out  &gt; there than it is to drive here. I don't know why. The miles just flew  &gt; by out there. I had a great time. Ron got better after the first  &gt; couple of days, and we settled into a "comfort zone" where we actually  &gt; kind of enjoyed ourselves. I'm glad I was driving though. &gt; &gt; I dreaded coming home, as usual, but it turned out it wasn't so bad. I  &gt; always forget how pretty the "green" of a Wisconsin summer is. I've  &gt; been somewhat "non-responsible" since coming home, but I figure I'm  &gt; just chillin' a bit before jumping back into life again next week. &gt; &gt; I'm going to guess you're already on the road. 1200 miles is something  &gt; you average in about two days, huh? Well, I hope you have a good time  &gt; and do well on your tour. &gt; &gt; ~Kelly &gt;

      Welcome to my space to overanalzye, process and scribe what's around and inside me. Enjoy.
