      I've spent most of my time sleeping throught the whole day. The first thing i did was answering Janet's phone and we talked for almost 40 minutes, i guess? Then we somehow ended the conversation because there was a sms coming in. ( She called to my handphone ) Ahah, Siew chien is still the top.. we talked for almost 2 hours ( my god ) 2nd , Bluewhale ( 1 hour ) 3rd, Janet ( 40 minutes non-stop ) and 4th, Danny ( he called over from n9 and the duration is about 20 minutes or a lil bit more ). Danny's ranking was once the first but after siew chien came back, whoa ! LoL~ girls usually talk much than guys do, isnt it?  Hmm, i'm looking forward to kee tzuen's reply from friendster. It's always fun.. fun to wait for one's reply ... i'm quite eager, and i dont know why? i guess i hafta train myself with patience one day.. else i'm really gonna get crazy because of my stupid character. Well, not to deny, i get nervous easily, at times, and this is a bad thing to do since i cant even handle myself, how am i suppose to handle things i am supposed to handle? LoL~  Something fun went on today. Pigzi, aloha, lico, sky , and some strangers (keigo, joeytee ).. a few of us went on yahoo messenger and had some voice chat. I was actually facing problems on how to use my mic, and i somehow got it right ! LoL~ it was fun ..pigzi's voice sounded "man" comparing to aloha's , lico is really good in singing but aloha teased her that she cant "tarik" when she sang the song ( forgot which ) ..duh, that stupid aloha never changed his habit ( teasin others ), and sky is very very friendly. Both lico and sky cant stop chatting when both of them are holding the mic.. LoL~ they call the 2 women, pasar malam -__-'' ( which is sooo true ! ) Aloha did something.. weird, i supposeD?  he asked weird questions and proved it himself, which is, are we able to hear one's voice from the phone if the mic is put next to it? the answer is YES. Everything wasnt right and sky can even sense it ! we cant seem to hear aloha's voice cause lico put the mic at the wrong place...( yeah, the talkin part ) and everyone was laughing.. She looks like a happy-go-lucky person to me, which makes my mood even betta , i would say ! But the bad thing would be.. since i'm using the older version of yahoo messenger, my ym kept on hang and i missed the aloha's voice part !! and it's just not fair ( acting like a mad cow.. ahahhaa )  I went to Siew chien's house. For the first time, i was being so punctual and i arrived earlier !  We first worked on the card i wanna make for him.. it didnt turn out that nice but i've done my best ( at least that's what i think ) Then she taught me alot of things i hafta do.. and i feel so "spirited" to do it.. i must do my best and not disappoint her , don wanna let myself down at d same time.. i cant bear the shame. She's helped me alot in everything.. MAybe i know i just needed a guiding friend, who's willing to teach me things. And I know i'm some type of person who is never keen in learning, lazy always... duh -___-''  Okay, i MUST study at all times... i lost to tht kim in some "fields" so i must win her in studies !!!!! ( i know this sentence looks stupid to anyone who's reading.. but who cares? )

( wheneve i see this word, i was thinkin of you ) 3) the msg u typed " who cares about sleep .. blah blah blah " that was when i started to learn from you. too bad we dont really keep in touch. 4) 18 june 2003 . u were at the club.. your pose was so cool ! leaning against the wall.. i will never forget bout that. i even sms-ed keson and told him about it. we talked for a while, only a while. i appreciate that though. 5) u loved to buy tissue in watsons .especially the cute ones. i think of you on kuching age group swimmin competition 2004 while i went to watsons. i missed u alot that day. i bought tissue that day too. 6) i can remember on year 2003, during swimming competition, u dont bother to get in the pool for warm up. it was a sunny afternoon and it was definitely very hot. u were reading your books. i like u since. 7) i kept most of all the sms-es u sent. guess that's why i don feel like changing a camera phone. ahah. nice fren.

Let me share with you how i think of my birthday before i forget anything. i tend to foget things, always. Duh ! Early morning, since 12.01am.. i started to receive sms from friends like eric fong, li chun, tai min, connie, roderick,and a net fren nicknamed "shemtam^leikei" ( don simply think ar..he's a apek in his thirties.. not the one whom i wan to make a birthday card )   I was touched ..even though those sms doesnt really cost much, but they bring the best wishes. I do feel good, it's just that "feeling" which i always believed in. U'll definitely feel soooooo gam dong when ppl get up or stay awake at 12am and have that idea of sms-ing ...even though that sms costs only the most 20cents..argh.. donno how to express better in words ( i owes forget words i want to use -_- call me "chi dun" ) haiya, u know what i mean la.. hehe .. we so fren already, no need to explain too much, right?  I dont get much sleep this few days. I wonder why. When it's about time, i always get into the bed and start to dream.. but cant get into sleep ler, i always think up and down.. till i really cant tahan in bed, i'll just walk downstairs and watch tv or online.. writing my own diary. I've this own habit of writing a online diary since.. donno when. Just found out that i've got alot of things to express but lack of listeners lor. So , you are proven true. Very true. Keep things in heart. But dont worry.. i'll sure kacau and "fan" u with all my problems till u cannot tahan.. About your charges.. forget about it la.. we sooooooo fren already, no need talk about cash one..hehehehe. Hmm, perhaps one day, i'll let u see the diary of mine.. only if u are interested. It's okay for me.. i guess. Cause i know u "watch mouth like bottle" .. ï¹P  About the pizzahut part, it was fun. I never talked so fast and crap so much..The jokes might be dirty, but as long as everyone is happy..i'm happy :D But i think my wallet is going to cry cause i seldom use my own money ..today didnt get money from my dad cause i know they had already spend alot on the food.. so i better shut up and curi curi take my own money from my angpao &gt;.  Well, late afternoon, my heart was filled with disappointment. I felt as if they all pakat to fool me cause everyone sms-ed me telling they are not going to turn up. The worst part would be they are not turning up and yet they didnt give me any further notice. That's bad, isnt it? I dont mind if they're not coming, but at least they hafta tell me earlier.. so that i can save more money from the food.. the food sucked my blood..But since everything passed, so let it be lor.  One surprise thing, Amie Pang. hahahaha.. she's really a funny girl.. also kiasu type..likes to bug the teacher for marks.. but very funny. Very "real" person.. not a hipocrit, unlike some others lor. I'm not really close with her.. But i'm surprised tat she phoned and drop by to give me that present. Feel like "dui bu qi" her.. shouldnt had tel her it's my birthday.. so that she can save more money.  At night, i can feel as if i'm crazy. I told my ah ma that all 6 boys are my boyfren ! ahah ! stupid act !  One more thing, thanks for sharing everything with me.. I'll strive hard for Spm this time. i'll try.  good night and enjoy your holiday in kuching ! dont be haunted by the memories, okay?   i'm not good in words, but i supposed u can understand me la. haiya ! reply your letter liao.. this time i crap too much la.. hahahhaa. i'm going to keep this email as part of my diary, so that i wouldnt need to re-write my diary lor. lazy hor?  Smile always. AhBit.  p/s : wei loong dint come ! actually i expected him to come .. cause my birthday is only the best excuse to meet him up.. i haven met him since year 2003 ! sigh. Take care.

      I haven been sleeping early during this holiday. It's not a nice feeling at all. I cant even get into my dreams ! I've got nothing to dream of ! Does this resembles that i've got no more hope in life? Dreams actually means something.. isnt it? Just chatted with Tin Cheng. He's actually a nice person with a kind heart. He loves giving advice and i bet he gives advice to anyone who needs it. Argh. I promised him to get 9A1.. but let's forget about the A1.. as long as it's A.. i'm satisfied. Tomorrow ownwards, i'll strive hard for my target.  My one and only Target..and that's SPM. Like Siew Chien has always said, try your best. I know, and i'll try. Seriously, this time.

      While walking down from the 3-steps-stairs, i slipped and fell. I'm just unlucky anyway, the old lady just mopped the floor and i just walked past that place, and slipped. Darn, i've got a scar on my left hand ( humerus , lol learn too much bio ) and have a big bruise on my back. Never felt soo unlucky before, especially when i've got alot fatter these days, i cant deny that it hurts alot. i was about to cry but i didnt. I only act cute to the kids and my sis, telling them how hurt it is. Hehe!  Studied only a liltle today. I aint satisfied with the old guy who teached my driving. He's not even serious at all. Duh, forget about it.  Let's talk about my feelings today in school. It's okay, i just dont like that girl, and i've no reasons why. I wont let myself lose to her anymore. Let's wait and see. It's right to say that i'm one type of person who's very obsessive ( ä½ææ¾ ? ) , and i dont like the feeling when Miss C is wif HeR. She seemed like she's another different person, more like a stranger. Well, i hate it when i have that kinda feeling. It's like u cant trust anyone else in this world and u can only work on yourself on anything, being mean to anyone and let others hate you.   I'm crapping again. Anyway, good night...  p/s : left 2 months, i'm going to lose weight for goodness sake.

      Dang, again. I'm addicted to games. Well, i cant deny that i can addict to anything easily. i promised myself to study yet i didnt do anything about it. I told myself to go at least the gym to get rid the circles of fat around my waist but once i'm at the club, i forgot everything and hardly feel like doing any workout. Darnit. how can i achieve my goal then? what about the weight? studies? Shit. i'm not well-disciplined anyway.  Ate pizza today. No, not only pizza. i had lots of food. Went out of control and got a bulging stomach.

      Dang. i can never remember what i want to write about when it comes to writing diary online.I always have alot of things to say at different moments, but i never have d habit of jotting these ideas down, on a notebook or even on a piece of paper. Argh, am a lil stuck. what the heck. -.- Let's start wif my day. Supposed to write PiescesGuy a letter today, but i dont really haf d mood to sit down and write something. I can only be serious when ppl around me are really serious or realy NOT serious.  Went to d library. Drove car today. 2nd drive. it was nice, kinda nervous though. Feel like tellin everybody that i can actually drive a car now, but i dont think it's nice to tell everyone, they'll feel like i'm "showing off" of which i am not. I only wanted to express my feelings , for the sake of sharing. I almost finished biology chapter 2 !!! i must hurry.. must not let that GIRL win me this time ! let's see ! Made some cookies. The kitchen was in a mess though. My wrong. But that's something normal, ppl like me never get things straight, hehe!!! Time for bed though. Will try to jot down everything from now on. Wanna make my life more worthy. Am still trying.   p/s : i got fatter by 1-2kg .. Eeww~ i ate alot ! -.-

      I've no idea why i seemed to call myself stupid these days. eg. i felt asleep when i studied for bio, then coach chung woke me up. The moment i wake up, i slapped my face ( è¼è¼d ) and call myself stupid or useless. Sometimes i feel that i cant really achieve my target. Or i dont seem to have a target of my own? 8As. I never seemed to work hard for it though, not trying my best but am still trying. Got fatter. CAnt resist good food. Dang.  I've got a strange feelin that laobah will be leaving irc. I dont want that to happen. How i wished i can tell her how much i liked her as a fren or even a closer relationship, lao ba. I cant deny that i rely on her as much as lao bu, i just liked her.she's someone who keeps things to herself, only to herself. I know and i admit that i am a burden to her, eventho i liked her that much ( and i dont think she can sense it ) but i dont think she'll like me in another way. How i wished i can tell her how important she is to me. just like lao bu. Duh. I'm only making things worst. How i wished she and lao bu can always be at my side. Well, i know it's a selfish thought and that's quite impossible.   Tired. Here goes my day, wasted online.
