       The S fish tank is almost fully set up now. I added a bunch of new fishies yesterday. In addition to my existing harlequins, I now have 6 neon tetras, a midnight blue male guppy and 3 fancy female show guppies. As soon as I find a freshwater hermit crab, and perhaps a pleco down the road, then the tank will be completely complete.      I have given one of the guppies a new porn name,  urlLink Alysia Maelene , but now I need many more names (and a way to tell all the fish apart) for the rest of the new fishies.      On a sad note, Bondage Betta seems to be dying. He's in quarentine for now, and is showing some minimal signs of improvement, but I don't think he'll ever make it back to the community tank.

       So I randomly and sort of impulsively cut my hair today. I had been growing it for the last 6 years and now it's way short. We weren't going to cut it this short, but in order to donate hair for wigs for kids with cancer, the cut hair needs to be at least a foot long. So, 14 inches got cut off and now my hair is up to my jaw. I don't think I like it. It's going to be one massive pouf when it goes curly. I can't even pull it back anymore. It's so sad. But I guess it will grow out. Eventually.

       It's almost lunch time and so far today I have really done no work. I am at work and I am being paid to work. But I have done no work. Everyone is really quiet and keeping to themselves today. It's finally Friday. I am too sleepy to concentrate on anything. I'm ready for a day of nothing but lazing around. Too bad I'll be cleaning out closets and "staging" rooms at home so the house can be sold.       The one thing I am looking forward to this weekend is getting my hair cut. After 6 years of letting it grow long, I'm ready to take the plunge and chop it all off again. I'm still not sure what the end result will be... I think I will just let the hairdresser do whatever he wants to do with it. I'm anxiously anticipating the end result.      The school screwed me over and cancelled one of the classes I was really looking forward to next year. I spent a good chunk of time trying to pick new classes from the very limited pool of classes that aren't full yet. I've managed to do it. My school year will not be as I had planned, but it will fulfill all my requirements and I will still get out at the end. Barring any other unforseen bumps in the road.      At this point I have very little left to say, I'm just rambling in an avoidance of doing work. So now I will go find some other means of procrastination.

           The fishies at work had babies. I salvaged 7 of them.     I'm still working on fitting my own fishies with S names... I'm also busy looking for some kinky SM themed decorations for my tank. Oh the joys of long summer days with nothing more to do than think of themes for your fish tank. And I'd just like to say that it was my boss who came up with the S theme! I have a cool boss.

        And I'm mad about it!  I paid good money for my extra large type recycling bin to hold all my many recyclables.  I just hope that whomever the culrpit is, he or she is putting it to good use and this was not just some random act of crime on a bar night.  Now I need to get a new bin!  Bah!    But on the bright side of the world, I acquired a new book today,  urlLink  Call me Crazy       by Irit Shimrat.  It is yet another book on mental illness and the need for reform in our mental health system.  I do need to find other books that have nothing to do with my present life.  If I keep working/learning/reading about mental health, I'll end up in the looney bin myself!  But I do enjoy it.  So I shall go read.

                Well, I have finally decided to abuse webspace for my own personal   pleasure. I have no real plan for this blog so it will evolve   over time. I also have no real desire to advertise or tell people   about my own little space. I'll just let people find me if they   happen to. For now, I suppose I get the hankering for blogging   whenever I am bored or blah, so expect my own little stream of   consciousness ramblings whenever I need to think about something and have no one to bounce ideas off of.  However, now it's bedtime and I will most likely post more soon.

       I have bad dreams.  I don't like my dreams.  I wake up hating the person I am in those dreams.  They're getting much too frequent and crushing my days.

       On my way to work this morning I witnessed a man seat dancing and mouthing along to the music emulating from his diskman.      I was strangely disapointed that my own music was not as inspiring and enjoyable as his. So, I am now on a quest, a mythical and what might be a dangerous quest, to find new music that makes me want to get up and dance.      Oh, and missing the last train leaving Georgetown is no fun at all.
