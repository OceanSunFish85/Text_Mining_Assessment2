       After days complaining about everything, itÂ´s about time I posted something more interesting. At least, for those who really care!!    Well, thatsÂ´s it, here is a list of the hottest guys in my modest opinion. As there are so many, I decided to put them into categories. LetÂ´s go then:    COUNTRIES: every part of the world there is that guy, a real symbol of beauty.The winners are:    Spain : Antonio Bandeiras - Madonna was right. HeÂ´s really charming.   Great Britain:  Hugh Grant and Orlando Bloom. Both are really good looking. Every time I watch Notting Hill, itÂ´s easy to understand the reason Julia RobertÂ´s character was down over heels for him. In case of Bloom, well Legolas - should I say anything else? David Beckham - Victoria is definetely lucky - watermouthing.   Mexico:  heÂ´s just arrived - Gael Garcia Bernal. Besides, heÂ´s idealistic. This is cute, isnÂ´t?   United States  - since itÂ´s the place of Hollywood stars, the categories are sub-divided: * Tom Cruise - my teen crush. * Brad Pitt - his movies are awful, but heÂ´s hot. * Tom Welling - the young Clark Kent is handsome and also heÂ´s playing the role of my favourite super hero. * Paul Walker - I was watching MTV Movie Awards and suddenly, a curly blond haired boy shows up. WhoÂ´s that? was crossing my mind. * Josh Harnett - sweet, sweet, sweet. * Dr Carter and Dr Kovac - without them, I wouldnÂ´t see ER. * CSI Warrick - uauh!   Brazil   * Reynaldo Gianechini - heÂ´s got it all! * RaÃ­ - I met him and love at first sight. He kisses his fans. Nice!   Italy   * I usually look forward to watching an Italian team match. You always find out one at least. They might play badly, they look good though!   I canÂ´t remember anything else, but they are here. I may have forgotten a few. ThatÂ´s my teen moment so enjoy it!!  PS: We accept some support!

       OK, what would you do if the world fell to the darkness? Well, that would be the first time that the whole world would join together and have a target as one. But I think I would spend all day long doing.  If I have to go to hell, then IÂ´d better justify that reason... Yesterday was the end of my work days with a party. By the way, my friend saved my day. I thought that a video was spoilt, but it turned out ok.  BAD NEWS  IÂ´m pissed with my fatherÂ´s second wife. SheÂ´s a bitch and a motherfucker. This was the very first time I felt betrayed and made as fool out of me. She wants to kill my family. IÂ´ve never thought I would hate someone as I hate her. God get this out of me. LetÂ´s forget because her punishement is on the way, I believe it. I have to believe... After this, IÂ´m through today :(

        Lovely line and one of my favorites!!! By Bowie, just in case... IÂ´ve been thinking how much time we waste in recollecting what it could be good or bad. ItÂ´s definitely something that we love doing and BAM: "I could have done an useful thing!". Should I follow my instincts or just stay cool and guess what itÂ´ll come up next? The funny thing is that we wnat to be strong and itÂ´s important to go on even when the situation seems to be awful.  Difficult question! IÂ´ve always liked those people who come to you and know exactly what they want to do and how theyÂ´ll perform that task. My dad used to be like that and IÂ´m afraid I didnÂ´t take after him. IÂ´ll miss his goodwill and I think I hadnÂ´t become what he wanted me to be. But time is something hopeful, so I still have a chance. Well, today IÂ´ve spent my day with my whole family. I was cheering for my team. That saying is when your team is doing badly and so is your life is unfortunatelly true.  Anyway, TROY waited for me and I went to see last Wednesday. I donÂ´t know much about the story, but I could notice that the story really matters despite the Brad Pitt and cast. Although, Hector would definitely be the general of my army.     FREAKY TEEN SHOWS    On Saturday, my sister and I remembered the freaky and embarrassing moments of our teen lives. I remember having to prepare a dance for Physical Education. My friends and I had decided not to do the activity. But, in the last minute, one of my friends panicked and changed her mind. She went there and just danced whatever she could do. The picture was either amazing or ridiculous. Of course, that we laughed to death.  Then, there was another time when we were supposed to prepare a dance again. The problem was we were in 15 people. In short, about 12 people rounded up three girls in the middle. These three basically did all the dancing while the rest just watched. Could this be any more stupid? How come a few teachers used to assign such activity? Just God might asnwer this. As soon as I remember more episodes IÂ´ll take them down.

       IÂ´m so back over here.  Well, yesterday I couldnÂ´t write anything because my time was short. So letÂ´s catch up with the news now. In the morning I went to my English school and it was pretty funny. I had a lot of fun. Then I was going to tell my boss about my decision( I was not feeling able to give a business class). When I got there, she had gone for lunch and nobody hadnÂ´t been able to tell me when she would be back. I couldnÂ´t think about how I would start that conversation and so on. By the time she got there, I told her my decision and of course I told how panicked I was about the class. I donÂ´t think she liked but she put up with it much better than I thought. Of course, as IÂ´ve already seen before, she must have been cursing my name all over the place, but who cares... Anyway, guessing that my time  at Evoluta is about to end,  I really need to do something else. How can I start I wonder??? Later, I gave tests to my students and came home. When I got here, everything was pretty calm. My sister said I was a chicken to the decision above. I know. The effects will come down soon, I suppose. LetÂ´s get over with it! Plus: today IÂ´ve had classes again and I Â´ve already told them about my proposition. I like those students. TheyÂ´re nice.  BOOK THE MONTH: The Da Vinci Code  Good and gripping!!

       Today IÂ´ve had a training teaching at UP Language Berrini, as they say, and again I found out that IÂ´m sick and tired of teaching.  BORING!!!!!!!!!! I love speaking English and learning new things about the language. but being a teacher has become a sacrifice and a real pain. Everytime, I talk or see someone whoÂ´s getting along with teaching well, I also feel jealous because I used to be like that and then itÂ´s gone slowly.  I wish I were a jornalist or work with something different and fun. This would be a sort of job where IÂ´d feel great being there rather than staying home for a change.  I remember having this feeling when I worked at PBF. It was good and I felt my locker as something sacred, really mine. It was a good feeling. Today, IÂ´m bored most of the time and complaining too much. Why canÂ´t the oppotunities knock on my door? Why are they taking so long? I want to change , to move and do something I really enjoy. IÂ´m not 18, but I want a revolution in my life.

      This is the end, my only love the end...For everything bla bla the end...  I donÂ´t remember but today most things are coming to an end... I can feel something in the air. But letÂ´s go to facts:  Yesterday there was a guy in my bed: my nephew :(.  I love him and I feel really grateful for his immense love, but letÂ´s face: that could be another kind of guy in there. Should I wait and complain?   Of course not, there are more things to be done: IÂ´m thinking about taking a trip...seriously!! All I know is that it should be somewhere nice and with lots of cute guys.  Today I have to work hard and I should be thinking about something better to do in July.  IDEAS: pop up!!!!!!

      Today, well I had my teeth filled. It was hurting as hell. Of course, I hardly ever take care of them properly.  take care    News : nothing, but IÂ´m pretty happy to go on my imaginary column. Album of the month: Vive la Fete!!! delightful  :) ItÂ´s sort of retro, but really and rockÂ´n roll lovely!!   Time to start tomorrow : big day - I think at least.   Movies of the month : Harry Potter and Prisoner of AzKaban and Motorcycle Diaries. Both are beautiful!!!! PS: I havenÂ´t got time for TROY ( Will they wait for me?)  href="http://www.kryptonsite.com"&gt;  is my favorite site for my favorite TV serie.   Topic of the day:    should I stay or should I go? ThatÂ´s the question: if you go out you might feel like doing something at once. But then the depression comes because the immediate things take a long time to work out. For instance: gym, diet, hairdo, new books, new job and new guys. Gosh!! Life is in a hurry!!!When do the things we want will come true as soon as we decided? This would be so much better than winning the lottery...Decision: going out is funnier tha staying at home. Life is also too short...people say... bla bla bla.   Today is enough!!!!!!!

       IÂ´m just about ot start a new webdiary, which is, letÂ´s say quite difficult since my life doesnÂ´t have too much to say. But anyway, work is coming to an end and so is my money... This is sad, especially if you start thinking about that pair of shoes needed or wanted so much as well as the bills to be paid. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! News: I want to start a diet. I just need to find the right day along with the stars and the moon.  News 2: I guess IÂ´ll be looking for something better. Peole say I can make money. IÂ´ll believe it...
