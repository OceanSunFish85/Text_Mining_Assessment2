      So what if I couldnât drive??! Itâs not like it is a crime to not to know how to drive? I mean, itâs not like I am troubling anyone by asking them to give me a lift, right?? Right??!! Well, ok.. maybe in some cases when I go partying with my friendsâ¦ but then again, they offer to pick me up.. I didnât force them, did I? Did I?? Malaysia has lots of public transports to choose from.. so, why the worries??   Consider thisâ¦    Men prefer their women to be more independent. You are independent if you know how to drive. I do not know how to drive.    Can someone tell me whereâs the validity to the above statement?? Can anyone see the logic?? I don't think so.. but even if there's a yes among you people who read this.. I'll say, "Screw the men!" It's not my problem if they couldn't accept the fact that I can't drive!

      I hate my company.   Iâm miserable and itâs all my bloody inconsiderate bossâs fault.  Although I also blame my Iâm-24 hours-busy-bf and all his smooth talks that for some reasons stop my questionings on his lack of attention towards me lately. I point my finger of shame at J for telling me that I can be pushy when I choose to be, my âso-calledâ dedicated lecturer who was supposed to provide me with the information on the 2 important major courses Iâm taking this semester so as not to land myself with another super stupid C+ and the entire family of Hitz FM for playing all the wrong songs at the wrong time.   I find the following people and creatures guilty of conspiracy to inflict misery upon me: my handphone for giving me trouble in typing texts, the taxi drivers for repeatedly taking the wrong routes when I repeatedly with my sweet looking face telling them, âPlease take the Pusat Sains Negara route and turn into your right after the traffic lightâ, my missing brown sandals for not showing up although it has been nearly two weeks now, my totally chubby legs and most of all the boy bands in general for their I-canât sing-but-thanks-to-my-good looks-performancesâ¦   I positively loathe men who approach the forever-so-romantic-in-the-head-women with their you-are-so-beautiful-pick up lines in order to get into their pants!!!
