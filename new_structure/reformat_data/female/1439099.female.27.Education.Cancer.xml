      Ok, I'm a Gorge Virgin and am nervously excited about the trip!!  So I thought that it might be a good idea to start a 'stuff list'  &gt;- Tent (sleeps 4) --  Jasara    Wayland, are you bringing a tent as well? we're good for the first 2 nights, but mimi will be arriving a needing a place to sleep.  i have a tent that sleeps 3 (but really 2 comfortably) that i can bring if i need to.   ps. love that you can edit somebody else's post. :)  -Luciana

       Oh I said, I was driving with a friend just the other day  Down the sea an old man wrote a book and told a good story   So we sat and sipped the wine with him  We sat and had a good good time  And listened to wisdom of the old  'Cause they know what's on the line    "It's a good good time tonight"  Sitting there he said,  "It's a good thing to have good friends  Young and old the same."    Don't believe what ya say  Well style's ok, but you've got your style of your own  Don't listen to the tv, just make your own way home.    Its a good time tonight  Come maybe with you  And don't believe there's a light that's brighter  Than the one that shine's from you.    You're a good good time  A good time tonight, for sure  And roll up your feeling, let the whole thing roll on    It's got a bit of soul, got a bit of soul  Got a bit of soul in everyone  I'm telling you friend, telling you friend,  You got to shine on shine on.  Gotta shine on, shine on, yeah  Shine on, shine on.    He said that the brightest thing is the things at the borders  And you hear one thing, said  This is right sometimes you hear this is wrong  But in your heart you know  The truth it always shine on    Difference says between you and me  Ah, but they can lie down  'Cause the wine taste good  And the dance is feelin' fine, fine, fine     Cuz we got a good good time tonight  And we're gonna have it here  Always good good friends your coming  Lay it on me.  Lay it all on me.  Lay it on me.   Don't worry about what's on your mind.  Feel alright here tonight  It's a good good time tonight  It's all a waste  Fill your head with good things  Fill your head my friend     Hope we don't start  Hope we don't start  The stars stay forever  I hope that I do too  Here tonight with ya'll  Here tonight with you   So cry cry cry, if that's what makes you  And laugh laugh laugh, if that's what does it to you  Cry cry cry, if that's what you need to  And laugh laugh laugh, if you in the mood  Cry cry cry, if that's what you got to do  And laugh laugh laugh, if you want me to  Cry cry cry, if that's what you got to  Laugh. Laugh. Laugh.

      First... You're all DORKS.  So am I.  Second:  Flights? That's groovy.  Hotel plans? That's fine.  Tickets? Whatever.  I'm interested in how we're going to get the essentials. Ummm.. Bud. Green. Wacky Tobacky. Hippie Lettuce. Fun Broccoli. Reason For Visine. Herb. Gange. Ganja. Dubage. Munchie Instigator. Muse for the cheez-it and bbq lays sandwich. MariJane. Weed. KB. Shwag. Nugs. Z. Glaucoma Medicine. Brain Freeze Leaves. Dankity Dank.   I cannot be at the gorge without: burning one down. firing up a jernt. puffing a phattie. blazing up. smoking my mind. taking a ride on the hippie train. sitting in the circle. two words: BONG LOADS. Taking my glaucomamedicine.   "Sure.. It's medicinal. If Idon't smoke it, I could goblinder." "Dude. I'm soooo wasted." "The chick.. she can't hold the smoke." "These guys were light weights. All it tookwas a fat chronic blunt." "Do you have a joint? You'd be alot cooler if you did."    Yeah. You know what I mean.  Wait.. What was I talking about.

      Okie dokie folks... Here's what we've got so far...   The Car!  -Explorer... estimated 3-Day Rental total (with tax): $285.69  Here's how it breaks down...      Wayland researched hotels and found the Embassy Suites Seattle Tacoma Airport.        *Marjorie... it would be great if we could all be at the same hotel for much-more-fun and for caravaning purposes, no?  (Spoken from a Gorge Virgin)  WOO HOO!  It's getting closer... I can't wait!

      Okay..i'm back in planning mode and trying to figure shit out.  Wayland..i understand you booked the car. Can you post how much it was and how much we all owe?  Same for the hotel?  Also, I realized today that on Sunday Mimi is picking up the rental car for our trip, and yet, at the same time, i'll have the car we rented for the gorge. Not to be a pain in the butt, but is there some way we can figure out the pricing for that since i wont be utilizing the car monday? If not, not a big deal..just trying to watch my pennies.  woohoo! exactly a month from now we'll be tailgating! yay!
