        Dag nab it. Look what I found               Kindergarten classes are provided for all children of kindergarten age in the Rochester School District. Michigan Statutes stipulate that before a child can enroll in kindergarten, he or she must be five (5) years old on or before December 1.       Each spring the district conducts a Kindergarten Registration to identify and enroll youngsters who will enter kindergarten in the fall. Informational evening meetings are held in the spring for parents. Newspapers will announce the dates.       It greatly assists the districtâs planning efforts if all kindergarten students are identified in early spring. Parents should contact the Student Enrollment Office or plan to attend Kindergarten Registration if they have a child who meets the age requirements.   Pupils are assigned to either morning or afternoon sessions based upon geographical location. Sessions are three hours and five minutes. Daily attendance is stressed because kindergarten is an integral part of the total instructional program."       *grmbl* Leslie could have started last year if she were in Michigan. She was ready. We fought them in Kansas to let her to no avail. AND she's been in half a day preschool for 2 and a half years. I want to go back to work and only having half a day school for her complicates things substantially.
