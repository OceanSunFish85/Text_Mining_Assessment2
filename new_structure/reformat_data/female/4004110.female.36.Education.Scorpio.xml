						   Today mom, liz, jess, kayssen, and i went to silver dollar city. we got off to a late start, but it was a lot of fun. we all got soaked...and then some. mom says the best part was a toss up: the lost river, the american plunge, and funnel cakes. jess bought a marionette that looks like a red bird. kayss got tired and cranky. liz didn't throw up on wildfire, but the nachos at denny's did her in. i have decided that i need a new ride-buddy; someone who screams, but doesn't vomit, someone who doesn't care if they get twisted, turned upside down, or nearly drowned all in the name of fun. someone like....me. lol. guess that's it for tonight as it's actually morning now. time for bed! so i can start all over again in the morning with the trip back to agnos.

						   and it's always full of heart-rending horrors. you know, i spent several years getting "out of touch" with the news; avoiding papers, radio, internet, and television. while i was in school, it was vital to reconnect in order to perform, first for instructors, then for students. guess the real news could be summed up with a caption to read, "what is our world coming to?" mothers killing babies, husbands killing wives and children, people killing each other---and themselves. like we don't have enough problems, without self-annihilation.   i have a 22 year old step-son serving in Iraq. it is very rare to hear from him, and the worry is always present that each IM may be the last. what would you say, if you knew the words you spoke would be the last ones a loved-one heard? what would you say, if you knew with certainty that as your beloved's voice died away, so would one or both of you? i don't know, but i think it would be a good idea to make sure everyone knows how very  dear  they are, don't you?

						   i'm hopeful no one i actually know will find this page...sure wouldn't want people knowing what kind of crap is truly floating around in my head.   okay, so let's roll, and see what we come up with:   it is a beautiful day outside; sunshine and cicadas, not too hot, not too humid; just right. it would be a wonderful day to walk out to the orchard, or see how big the koi are growing in the goldfish pond out back. if only the chiggers weren't so bad! so i'll wait until later to brave the back yard.   it's funny to think about having a "back yard." why? because my back yard is about four acres, not counting pasture, or the orchard. i spent several years living with grandma and granddad in buffalo, mo, and we had a huge yard. loved every inch of it: stealing bird eggs from the nests, roaming the field looking for unbroken skeet discs, playing hide-n-seek. later, in miami, ok, and again in springfield, mo, the neighbors were so close there wasn't much of a yard. kind of a mini-yard.   this yard is set up for me. i needed a place to "be alone," so it has a 1000 gallon koi pond, plenty of flowers, and huge shade trees. bug and i sit out on a wicker love seat and watch the fish roil the surface in the mornings. i have one fish in there that is almost two feet long. pretty soon i can take up pond fishing... =) why do i need an "alone" place? because i have a problem with depression. it's something i live with every day. sometimes worse, sometimes better, but always there. having the living things (i.e. fish, plants, dogs, cats, children) around helps to remind me that: a) life goes on, and b) there are things worth living for. things like: the first cherries of spring, bluebirds sitting on fence posts, mimosa flowering in the sunshine, and watching a full moon rise over the small sand beach not far from here. silly things---the most worthwhile of all the "little reasons."   anyway, today my teenager was able to tear herself away from The Kids Next Door (cartoon) long enough to accompany me to the grocery store. or Mall-Mart, asshecalled it when she was small.  grocery shopping is really an excuse for three otheractivities. the first is to be able to drop the top on our little car and go for a long ride. thesecond is to see a few of the people i know, and visit a little bit. the third reason--well, the  TRUE  reason---is so we can go to McDonald's and buy a cheeseburger for  ladybug . bug loves a greasy, salty, carb-enriched burger any day! she says it's much nicer than a big bowl of Beneful. can't say i blame her.   so now i'm playing with the 'puter, and waiting for the sun to sink a little lower so i can go outside and work on the desk i am refinishing. it's funny, in a sad way, that i am working on this dratted desk now. i am a teacher without a position. i stayed at home for several years, went to college, graduated, and am now unemployed. it has been a year, and it is killing me. i have had several interviews... if you have ever applied for a position in a field well known for its nepotism, you may know very well the frustration of not having the contacts needed to secure the job. rats.   so i have a degree, a certificate, three closets full of clothes, shoes, and all the other stuff, a room full of supplies and posters, AND a beautiful antique oak teacher's desk complete with roll top...and nowhere to use 'em. funny. oh well, i'll begin grad school in the spring if nothing turns up before then. gotta make plans. keeps the ball rolling, anyway.

						   As a person living in a small/tiny area of Arkansas, my computer connects to the internet via dialup. One of the things i do while waiting for the email to download from the server and pass through a secondary spam filter is to scan the Netscape headlines. Some are amusing, some stupid. Many are tragic, and these are the ones i want to opinion on at the moment.   When the little Ramsey girl died, the media sharks covered each detail with a voracious appetite. EVERYONE was blamed except, maybe, the president. While i could understand the lengths gone to in order to find the murderer, i also felt that the family deserved the respect given, by most people, to a family mourning the loss of not only a family member, but of a  child .   Surely, you have heard the saying that there is nothing worse than the loss of a child? Or perhaps this one: it is not right that the child die before the parent. Coverage continued far past the point of decency--i stopped reading.   Then Laci P. vanished---pregnant, husband suspect, ect. And the newscast was all over it again. While i can appreciate the media acting as an agent of aid in the search for the missing young lady, once she was "found" the media should have let it go. Who is left to take the brunt of the pain the media inflicts with a constant barage of comments? Why, the family, of course. His family, her family, and those friends each have that are "like a sister" or "like a brother."  Now, Lori H. has vanished---pregnant.... You get the picture. Once again, the media is being helpful, to a point. To that young lady's family: i am so very sorry that this has happened. My heart is with you as you search for your beloved Lori. May she be found alive.Love to you, and courage.
