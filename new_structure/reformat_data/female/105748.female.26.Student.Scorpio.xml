       face="verdana, arial, helvetica"&gt;Wow, Ching.    I'm amazed that anyone watches soap operas - seems like everyone I know has 'em going on in their own lives.  Or maybe they watch 'em for advice.        How's your writing going, Ching?  I always liked your stuff!

      Welcome, Jay / Daf !  I'm glad that you made it !  So what do you think so far? Like it?    We have our own drama (or tragedy, depending on how you want to look at it) going on in my parents' household. The past two weeks have been a blur, really.. We had our house-warming- slash -birthday party for Brian, which was a lot of fun. Shortly after that, my mom's purse is stolen at work. Her and dad close their bank account and create a new one, get replacement ID cards (driver's license, etc.), cancel credit cards, inform Sprint (her cellphone was in the purse).. Thankfully, her keys and her prescription eyeglasses weren't in the purse (her eyeglasses cost her $400 ~~ mine didn't even come close). I'm not even going into the fact that it was a Dooney  Bourke purse.. That's the smallest thing that she was worried about. She was more concerned about the contents. Everything has been taken cared of, I believe.. The only thing left to replace is her green card. I don't know how much it costs to replace it, but I heard it's not cheap. It's not like replacing a driver's license.    [ Speaking of which, Brian and I had our driver's licenses replaced a little bit ago. So now, we have new ones that have our new address on them !  ]    Going back to the drama.. This is the same week that Matt and Jen broke up, so Jen (and Logan) moved back in. She was in the process of getting my old bedroom reorganized as her bedroom is now the office. That was fine with me and mom and dad welcomed her home with open arms and everything. Within the span of a week (if it was even that), she gets herself kicked out of the house !  She had not even unpacked, yet !  Yes, my sister is seriously messed up. You think she would've grown up now that she's a mom and almost 21 ~~ but, NOOO !     Among her list of offenses: (1) sleeping while she's supposed to be watching Logan, (2) partying ~~ even when the baby is sleeping over at mom and dad's house, (3) not coming home from partying, (4) not being around when it's her turn to babysit her own son, (5) not caring about the welfare of her own son, period.. The list goes on and on and on. On nights when she parties, she doesn't even bother to call and check on her baby. Mom said that Matt prefers that Logan is with him at all times, doesn't like it when he's away from the baby and when the baby sleeps over at my parents' house, Matt always calls at night to check on how he's doing. Matt has more "maternal" instincts than my sister !  Can you believe it?    The last straw was when Jen brought home this guy, Justin, who she had only known for a couple of days. She had asked before they went out if he could spend the night and mom explicitly said no.. For one thing, we barely knew this person. She barely knew this person. The had not even been dating a week and they're already sleeping together. You don't flaunt such blatant irresponsibility in the face of my mom. She is a very patient, understanding and giving person, but there's a line that one should never  ever  cross.    The following morning mom wakes up and notices that Justin's car is still outside. Of course, she begins to wonder. She knocks on my sister's bedroom door (she's in my old bedroom). My sister, in her infinite wisdom, steps out in her underwear. My mom tells her that he needs to leave.. If not, both of them have to go. Guess what my sister does. She goes back to sleep. It's like talking to a wall, I'm telling you !  This goes on for a little while. I guess mom tries again, but gets the same response. Ignored, my mom resorts to calling dad who then advises her to call the cops. They don't take her seriously at first (probably thinking that she's bluffing ~~ if there's one thing I know, it's that my parents do not know how to bluff ~~ you better believe it because it's real and it's happening), but when they hear my mom give the policeman descriptions over the telephone, they finally decide that it's time to skiddadle.    The policeman came for a brief period. Jen and Justin were already gone at that point. Mom talked to him for a little bit, wanting some sort of reassurance that she had a legal right to do what she did. He agreed with her and assured her that she wasn't responsible for my sister any longer. Brian and I arrive shortly after. Dad had called me early in the morning and asked me and Brian to come because he was worried about mom and what Jen might do. The whole family thinks very little of her at this point.    So anyway, that's how my sister got kicked out of the house.

        Hi, I'm here. Actually, I heard that Yahoo Clubs will merge with Yahoo Groups. Groups is real cool, as you know! Clubs  is  a bit limited, though.       Here's what's new with us: Jessica (our Ching-aged daughter) is 8 months pregnant - still living at home, lost her job, boyfriend she's not too serious about. We're hoping the baby's going to settle her down a little - she was REALLY drifting.       Andy (our 17-year-old son) has left home, and apparently dropped out of school, to live at his girlf's parents' house. He's gotten a good job (for a 17-year-old) at a performance auto shop, plans to get his GED and hit community college. They already have a baby together - that made things at home  real  rocky.       Kim  I are having a hard time with all this - we're going to counseling to try to get it straightened out. So far we're hanging in there, though.       Job's going well in that they like me  give me raises, but what a PITA! Had to cancel all my vacations for the next 4 months. Grumble.       Church gig's pretty good too. Can't get a sub, though - so I'm TRAPPED!    Help me! Help me!       Daf (tried some HTML - guess we'll find out if I did it right)

      Thanks for joining, Pia !   There aren't any members yet so I'm really glad that to see you here and to know that you're in this with me.. I'm trying to transition from  Yahoo! Clubs  to here because hardly anyone ever visits the old club anyway.    By the way, we rented  Dude, Where's My Car?  yesterday and it's really retarded. It's a collage of all the stupid movies ever made. Think  Dumb and Dumber  meets  Half Baked  (two movies which I have never ever seen and refuse to see ~~ I really cannot believe that I let Brian talk me into watching this one) with a little bit of  Men in Black  and  Galaxy Quest  thrown in.

      We went to see  Atlantis  the other day. It's pretty good. Brian has been looking forward to watching it since the first previews were shown. I liked it but it's not one of my favorite cartoons. I liked  Shrek  better. I also liked  Iron Giant  better.  Atlantis  didn't move me as much as the other two animated films did.    Speaking of animation, the one that we are  really ,  really  looking forward to is  Final Fantasy . I really don't care how much of a story it's got.. I'd watch it even for just the animation !!  The previews look amazing !     Mom is coming over after work today. She's bringing Logan. I am really looking forward to this afternoon because we will play, play and play. Tonight, Brian and I will attend the weekly Swing Club gathering at WSU. Brian has really come a long way. He knows lots of different turns now. He even knows a lifting move !  Dancing is so much fun !!

      hey congratulations grandpa Jay.   Glee, whats tv patrol? So sorry to hear about your uncle.  My Grandmoter died last year and she was partially blind due to Glaucoma(blood pressure in the eye).She moved back to the Philippines two years ago after my grandfather died.  She was much happier in PI since all her friends were there.  She got to go out and exercise, shop and go to the beauty parlor.  I think your uncle would get better care here in the US but as far as happiness, nothing beats being with people you know.  Its two weeks before my sisters wedding and my brother in law still hasnt ordered the tuxedo's  auurgh..   I just received word that my sister's former roomate Frances has a part in Aida the Disney musical in Broadway.  Woohoo!!!  If you guys want good seats for this play its good that you know someone that is part of it because they can get you good seating.  Full price seating but great seats!!!.  Okay enough plugging, I gotta get my own tickets too.  Dot wants to see it with me and her cousin Kathy.    I saw in the news that another volcano is erupting in Italy.  Wow, is this a sign of worse things to come?      Net

      I was watching the Filipino news program TV Patrol, and I saw the Mayon Volcano erupting. Dang, that's one huge mf! I'm fortunate not have any family members living near that area.      I just got word that my father's brother died from a stroke. He was the only one who did not come to America. I felt sad for him because I think they did not give him a chance most likely because he's blind. I think if he were here, he would have had a lot more opportunities because the government can help provide all sorts of aid for blind people. Then again, I should not judge. I really don't know what his life was like back in P.I.      My poor sister. She has been suffereing from sinus pressure. The doctors don't know why her sinuses won't drain properly. She's going to undergo a cat scan Saturday. I hope it's not anything serious. She's suffering from so much pain she basically stopped taking pain relievers because they don't work.      Nothing exciting is going on today--I'm just going shoe shopping to match my dress. My mother reserved for all four of us to attend my godbrother's wedding Saturday. (Of course, my sister can't go--she has the cat scan.) I wish I did not have to go. But it would be rude not to go since my mom already RSVPed. I just don't know the groom and his family that well. I would feel like I was crashing a formal event.      I went to the Waves of the Word: Movements of Poetry (a benefit for APIA Youth Poetry) Wednesday night. That was da bomb! If you ever get the chance to see the Chicago spokenword group I Was Born With Two Tongues or NYC's spokenword/music crew FEEDBACK, check them out ! I think they do tours and benefits. California, esp. the Bay Area, has its gems: 8th Wonder. All three groups are a must see.

      Good morning, everyone !  Portland is bugging again so we won't be able to publish for the time being. Everything should be okay in the next 24-48 hours. Just be patient and keep blogging anyway.    Hey, did you guys hear about Mayon Volcano? It's been errupting sporadically for the past two months and after a two week lull, I heard it errupted again !  I'm so glad that my family is far from that area. If you guys still have family in the Philippines who happen to live close to the volcano, I hope they are well. You might try to get in touch with them just to make sure everything is okay.

      You're right.. There was a small reference to the video store.. But for the most part everything happened at the convenience store. As far as level of achievement, though, they're all the same to me. Convenience store, video store.. You can even throw in fast food joints, if you want to.    " It's not the size of the diamond that matters; it's the size of the heart of the giver. " I agree. I couldn't have put it any better !     And YOU ARE going to send me a picture to but next to your name !     If anyone is wondering why this post is at four in the freakin' morning.. I'm having one of those days again.. I woke up, crying, from a really bad dream and now I'm afraid to go back to sleep.

      Weddings, marriages, engagements, brides maids, grooms men....ACK! I have set perception. I see the topic of wedding everywhere: videos, on TV, men's confessions of propsosal jitters on the web, people talking about their sisters getting married in online diaries, etc. I'm nervous just being a bridesmaid. So far, I'm the only person who volunteered to help the maid of honor with the bridal shower. My sister had the most difficult time finding fabric for the bridesmaid dresses. She had to deal with so much rudeness at the fabric store, and the other store she went to got robbed. Speaking of engagement rings, my sister's was a half carat in a platinum ring. My mom estimates a thousand. My engagement ring was cubic zirconium (sp?). No one noticed, not even me. My ex-fiance admitted it to me years after the fact.      Vince, I can empathize with your situation. I would be nervous too. Then again, I don't have any pressure to propose to anyone soon. Last time I suggested marriage to my significant other--she kinda laughed. Anyway, Vince don't worry. I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever you give her simply because it's coming from  you and it's you she loves. Well, that and the fact that she would probably be so excited about your proposal she would overlook the size. It's not the size of the diamond that matters; it's the size of the heart of the giver.      Ching, I was hoping you would narrow it down for me--otherwise a blurb can easily become a long meandering personal essay. *sigh* oh well. I'll think of something. I bet you are dying for a photo of me. LOL tough titties...ain't gonna happen.      Regarding OD, happy reading, Ching. Some of it maybe redundant cuz you already know my life story; you can skip those entries if you want. As for the rest of you, if you want my diarist name, just send me an e-mail at gleetv@yahoo.com (those who write why they need to read my drivel will get the quickest response).      I heard Berlin and Depeche Mode were gonna be in the Bay Area. Maybe they already played. I cannot keep up with everything.      A video store? I thought Clerks took place in a convenience store, at least that's how I remember it. I'm going to have to rent it again. When I first saw it, I was watching it with the sexiest guy who was not the least interested with me much to my frustration and chagrin.

      I got the email, Glee !  Printed some entries to read already.. The info that you were asking about is on my previous post. As far as what I want on your blurbs.. You all have total creative freedom. Write/say whatever you don't mind the rest of the world knowing about you !     We didn't have any money, Net, so my engagement ring cost hardly anything.. I cherish it nonetheless. To me, it's the thought that counts.. Besides, I wasn't even expecting an engagement ring at all.. So it was a pleasant surprise.    Brian used to work at a video store !  That's probably one of the reasons that he enjoyed  Clerks  so much.

      I have been so depressed lately.  Been worrying about popping the question to Dot.  I has dawned to me that my sister is getting married in a few weeks and this is putting some pressure to me about propossing to Dot.  In all my wonder years, I have been told to set the example, and now sister is showing me a thing or two. Im the eldest of all my siblings and I should be setting examples!  Augh!! Good Grief!!  Whats a man suppose to do?  Dot has also been hinting that she prefers an engagement ring that's worth ten grand!! Looking at my money market account, if I withdraw ten grand that leaves me with nothing.  You are the weakest link, goodbye.    My branch manager now is also putting the pressure on me and my co-worker Mike.  We have to set the example to the rest of the crew.  Either shape up or ship out! he says.  Well, Paul, I say to myself, If you really want to make a difference, why dont you do it?  Note to self... Getting too personal on Blogger.  Just keep it to yourself and hit the stairmaster in the gym....     ~NET    PS Yet to see Final Fantasy.  I will give my review later  this week.  CLerkS was unusual but if you dont get the sarcasm, try thinking of yourself working in a video store with nothing else to do.  I think it shows the realism of people that I know.

      I read about  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  in last month's (actually the July one, I'm thinking last month because I already have the August issue) Elle magazine. It got rave reviews. Brian and I both want to see it, but I will doubt that we will be so lucky considering  where  we live. It probably won't make it to the theaters here, so we will have to wait for it to come out on DVD rentals.    OPEN DIARY: Give us your diarist name !

      I watched all four movies you mentioned. I like them all with the exception of Clerks. I only liked the cadence of the banter of one of the clerks, and, yes, those scenes are unforgettable. But I didn't think it was funny--just weird.      Charlie's Angels was indeed goofy. I thought it was funny. I also loved the soundtrack cuz the music reminded me of my youth. I can't believe I used to listen to Motley Crue. I also love dance movies. Gladys has the Save the Last Dance DVD. We love the audition scene (the music for that was great! the R mixed with the orchestra music--nice blend of classical and soul).  I even watched an Australian foreign film about a ballroom dancer who wanted to win a tournament so badly and a Japanese foreign film about a man who took ballroom dance because he was lonely. Yes, I'm corny.      I could not send you an URL with my section if I wanted to. The only way you can read it is if you press "random" and by luck you find it OR you know my dairist name OR you know the age I put down OR you know the location I put down OR you know the name of my diary OR they feature it on the "recent entries" OR I'm the Editor's Choice (most unlikely).

       Mall Rats  is good. It flopped on the box office when it came out and the critics hated it, but Brian and I are big Kevin Smith fans.. We've seen each and every one in that series:  Clerks ,  Mall Rats ,  Chasing Amy  and  Dogma . It all kind of ties in with various references in the movie. I even got Brian the comic book,  Chasing Dogma , that tells how Silent Bob and Jay got from where they were in  Chasing Amy  to the spot where they just happened to be in  Dogma .     Charlie's Angels  was really goofy. One shouldn't take it seriously.. A lot of people who do, end up thinking it's retarded.. It was meant to be a funny movie (to me, anyhow). I thought it was funny !  One of my favorite parts is the dream dance sequence. I'm really into dancing movies:  Save the Last Dance ,  Dance With Me , etc. I loved that dress !  I actually got myself some underoos(I can't wear them now because they shrank), just because they looked cute on Cameron Diaz !  You all know how impressionable I am !     I want the URL to get to  your  section of opendiary !!!  Come on, Glee !

      I finally saw Final Fantasy yesterday. WOW! The animation was great! Talk about detail--every strand of hair, every wrinkle. The captain looked like Ben Affleck (sp?) though.      Guy Pearce stars in Memento. I don't know who he is so I don't know if that if information would be of any help. Still, go see it!      My sister Gladys bought many DVDS which I had the opportunity to view at least a few. Let's see...    Mall Rats   Power Puff Girls   Cinema Paradiso (excellent! Don't watch the dub in English. The Italian priest sounded like he was a Jewish rabbi from NYC.)   Camille Claudel (also, excellent)  Charlie's Angels (entertaining. I also liked the special segment in which they described their training for the martial arts stunts.)   Say Anything ( i love this movie! I just like John Cussack sp?--I cannot spell anyone's names lately)     I missed Dido when she played in the Shoreline Amphitheatre in the South Bay Area. I decided not to go, but sometimes I feel like kicking myself for not going. I did go to Ani DiFranco in Berkeley, which is only 30 minutes drive from my home city. This was the fifth Ani concert I've seen. She opts for smaller venues than the collesiums and giant stadiums. She is very funny and personable when she talks to the crowd. She is very experimental with her music. For example, a spokenword piece in her CD can be incredibly rocked out in one concert or have a funky bassline in the next concert. Her older songs don't have a brass section, but in a concert she would have trumpet players and other horns playing. Her roots are in folk music--the grassroots political music. If it weren't for her blend of rock, R, funk, and jazz  combined with lyrics that either captured the complexities of love relationships, fought against big music industry, and constantly questioned the governement; well, I'd just say "another dyke with a guitar--yech, phooey!" Now, I see a mighty mite on stage who challenged the big guns on her own terms and won.

      Whatever you do, do not watch the English dubbed version on  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . It's hard to take the film seriously with the semi-acceptable English dubbing. The translations are so raw, it ends up sounding silly. After watching it dubbed, I appreciated that they showed the subtitled version of the film in the theaters.

        Our rentals lately:   Fantasia 2000  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon   and then we bought a bunch of used rentals:   After Hours  A Boy and His Dog  Peggy Sue Got Married  After the Fox   ...and one more I can't remember right now.  For a while, we were buying up movies all over the place - but they really need to be   re  watchable.  We've got a bunch of stuff we'll probably never watch again:   Bird on the Wire  Vacation  His Girl Friday  Liebestraume  The Fisher King   etc.   All the stuff we bought this time hits the rewatch mark.  And  Fantasia 2000 , though not as good as the 1940 one, is certainly one worth seeing a few times.   Crouching , though?  Probably not.  Daf

      I haven't been to any good concerts lately.. I love both Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks.. That must have been an amazing show !  I've never seen either of them perform live.  I can imagine what it must've been like, though.. Noone special has been through Wichita recently. Vanilla Ice (yck ! ) performed at Rita's just a couple of days ago. I'm not that desperate to go to a concert. So I passed. The last concert Brian and I went to was a while back.. Godsmack, Stained, Cold and Systematic.    How does everyone like the new layout? I forget who designed it, but it was one of the winning entries in Blogger's Template Design Contest. By the way, you all need to give me blurbs about you that we can put on the members column to the right.. It's kind of bare right now.

        Note - tried posting this yesterday - firewall probs.  Here goes again...    Present!      I should be a grandfather by next week... Jessica's as big as a house.      Work's a bitch - mandatory overtime now through September. Found out today that we're rehiring a friend of mine (who left for greener pastures, then got laid off), and she'll be working for me. So that's cool.      I don't wanna know my score. It's one of the few things ALL the voices in my head agree on. g      Two concerts in the last two weeks - Stevie Nicks with Sheryl Crow (opening act Jeffrey Gaines), and Wynonna and her band. Stevie was Stevie - no surprises, really - good band, fun crowd, she and Sheryl work real well together. Wynonna was excellent! Covered a lot of different styles - blues, RB, rock, gospel, pop-jazz, contemporary Cbristian- not really much country, though there's this country feel that's different from other styles (more emphasis on 1  3, backbeat a little stiffer - if you care about that stuff) - and that was prevalent throughout. She sang covers of Fab Thunderbirds, Avalon, Joni Mitchell. Had a gospel trio behind her that was excellent, plus a real good band.      Either show's worth checking out. Sheryl Crow's coming back to Michigan without Stevie in a couple of weeks - I love her stuff, but her voice isn't all there live (not just the show we saw - I heard a live CD later, had the same impression). So we'll probably skip it.      Anyone else see any good concerts?      Daf (= Jay)

      Thank you for clarifying that for me. You would think I would know who Perverse Angel  and Brian are by now, wouldn't you? hee. Brian used to be Dark Angel. A bit of Ching trivia.      I cannot view the picture. Your link leads me to a page that says "Forbidden." It says I need a "local referer." I have no idea what that is.      I heard that Final Fantasy had some really bad scriptwriting in terms of dialogue. But, like you, I'm really interested in the animation. I'm gonna grab the bargain matinee tomorrow.      If you must know what has been keeping me busy, I joined a diary community at www.opendiary.com. If you are nice, maybe I'll give you my diarist name.

      Daf = Jay.  Perverse Angel = Cherrie = Ching.   Ching + Brian = Together Forever.    I'd forgotten how much I love doing social math.  I can't see the picture either. I know what the problem is, though.. That image is stored on the Yahoo! server. Yahoo! and GeoCities no longer allow you to link to anything stored on their servers. You can see it as long as you go directly to the source, or it's linked from a website on Yahoo! or GeoCities.  urlLink Click here  if want to see the photo.     Final Fantasy  is great !  You have to go see it. It's the future of animated films.

      Please don't hold those results against me; those ARE my good qualities. just kiddin'      No, no, no. We should NOT have this constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriage. I was just trying so hard to sound impartial earlier  just so people could check out the issue and the site themselves. However, I'm not impartial. If this amendment passes, it will be part of the U.S. Constitution thus nullifying any state or local laws that permit same-sex marriage or civil unions--some say it may have a negative impact on domestic partnership rights/benefits. Married couples have benefits: health insurance, medical visitation rights, medical decisions involving a sick spouse, custody rights, adoption rights, inheritance/possessions, etc. Same-sex partners cannot have those rights without having a legal union to legitamize their relationship. Okay, I'm done with my ranting and raving.     Hi, Ching, I'm glad the party went well. You flips sure know how to party in Wichita. My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and she observed Filipino families are fun-loving people. I have yet to see FINAL FANTASY.       I have never seen a VCD before. I have seen a VCR/5-disc changer DVD player and a FM radio/VCR/TV. So, once again I'm baffled. Hmmm...speaking of baffled. I cannot view the pic with Dot. Probably something wrong with my computer. *sigh* oh well. I feel like such an airhead. I cannot keep your names straight. Net = Vince, right?  Net + Dot, right? Daf ? Where is Daf?     ARGH!

      Friday the 13th came and went without any glitches. We saw  Final Fantasy  yesterday afternoon. Has anybody else seen it? Pretty amazing animation ~~ you can see strands of hair !  The characters looked so real !  It more like a movie-movie, instead of an animated film. The story was okay. Not really all that spectacular, but the spectacular job they did on the animation made up for it (to me, anyhow).    We (Dave, Donna, Brian and I) attended Logan's birthday party at my parents house last night. There were a lot of guests. Logan came away with so much stuff !  He is going to be one spoiled little boy. I can already see it !  The rocking horse was a big hit !  Logan loved it !  I was really pleased about that.    Mom is having a second party for those who were unable to attend Friday night on Sunday. That's how it is here in Wichita. The members of the Filipino community are so sensitive. You have to make everyone happy. No one must feel left out. Otherwise, you're done for !

      That's pretty funny, Glee !     Well.. Well.. Well.. Guess who can't sleep? You guessed it !  I've been tossing and turning all night. I'm actually amazed that I didn't wake Brian up as I got off the bed. I hope he doesn't wake up from the keyboard noise. He's kind of a light sleeper. Thank God that the computer is now in a different room !     I've got lots of stuff planned for today. Two loads of laundry, one load of Dryel, dishes (hopefully only one load), got to the bank to do a change of address (yes, I've been procrastinating), pick up paycheck and book from Pat (lady on my team at work) to Jodi Anderson (lady on Brian's team at his work that used to work at Spiegel) that I left at work (I forgot it as I was leaving the other day and I forgot it again yesterday ~~&gt; Can anyone say Gingkoba?), go to Walmart to get refill on birth control, stop by Brian's work to bring the previously mentioned book (if I remember), watch  Thirteen Days  with Brian, go to Brian's parents' house to help assemble Logan's present and for supper, meet Misty (with new dance partner, Jorge) at swing club, return movies ( Monkey Bone ,  Down to Earth  and  Thirteen Days  ~~&gt; I'm telling you, between movie rentals and new movies, Brian and I watch about five movies a week ! ).. I think that's everything. As forgetful as I am, I can't help but feel like I omitted something. Oh, well.. Perhaps it wasn't  that  important.

Jann Arden appeared on the Regis and Kelly show and she said a blonde joke: "There are two blondes, each one on the other side of the street. One blonde yelled, 'How do I get to the other side?' The other blonde responded, 'You ARE on the other side.'"

      I am always having a hard time keeping up with your contact info. Thanks for the new e-mail addresses. I'm going to the Ani DiFranco concert tonight1 Yay! I showed my sister the photos from the archives of one of your other blogger groups--SMEAGHE TODAY maybe it. (What does SMEAGHE stand for?) You probably beat me in chess too. I might have a chance with Scrabble. However, my SAT vocabulary might not help me. I need those obscure short words to put me in the lead, and that's what I lack. But I kick gluteus maximus when it comes to air hockey and pinball. How do I create line breaks with this thing so my paragraphs don't  run together into one?

      I really like "Web Cloggers," too !  I submitted our blog to BlogHop already ~~ under that name.    Yes, Brian and I bought a Scrabble set recently. He got tired of me beating him at Chess !  Ha. Ha. We would've played Monopoly, but Brian's grandma hates it. I asked her once, "Why? But I heard that you're so good at it ! " She finds it boring because she always wins.    I have some close up shots of my hair from the back and from the side. They're in the archives of SMEAGHE TODAY. Is that where your sister saw it? Or is she just basing her opinion on the portrait below? The portrait really doesn't do it justice. I loved what the hair stylist did to my hair !     The email address that you should use is  ching@digitalrice.com  or  ching@liquid2k.com . Brian and I are thinking of getting a cable modem. We are sick of our slow-ass connection. I think, with his promotion and everything, we'll be able to wing it.  =)

      Okay, okay, The Spark people are the closest to the truth than I like to admit. I'm the one in denial. I think Ching has some idea about my slut ranking. I told her the number on my tally sheet, and she was in some sorta shock. I just think it's weird that I would be gayer than the typical lesbian. I thought it would be more likee I'm straighther than the typical lesbian. Some people (including my girlfriend) think I walk like a guy and think like a guy. And I feel like I'm in drag in a dress.    Speaking of dresses, I'm going to be one of the nine bridesmaids at my younger sister's wedding. My sister got engaged in April on her birthday. When will I get married? When it becomes legal in California. BTW, my sister really liked your hairdo for the Filipino ball, and she and I never saw a dark barong before.    I did not see fireworks, but I heard them go off. Then again, they sounded like gun shots so I stayed at home that night. I think the only highlight of the 4th of July is having a long lost friend drop by and she came out to me.    What's with the Scrabble games, Ching? You just bought a new set? When my girlfriend visited me, we played Monopoly four times in a two week period. Before I met her, I would play one Monopoly game every decade or so. I really believe you get to see the true colors of person once you play Monopoly with them. I watched my sweet, innocent girlfriend turn into a greedy, ambitious, little cheater.   The movies I saw this summer were Shrek and Tomb Raider. Both movies I enjoyed immensely. My sister and her fiance were disappointed with A.I. to say the least. He said, "Speilberg owes me 8 bucks." I've been wanting to watch Memento for a while now. And I can't wait for Final Fantasy.    Ching, what is your main e-mail address?   I thing Web Cloggers is the best name (that I suggested--I'm sure someone else could come up with something better). It goes with  your slogan about the basis of your chingay sites.

          Love is always a wonderful thing [blush].   I took the gender test - 86% male - and there weren't even any questions about fantasy baseball!  Also took the sex text - it says one more person, and I'll be in love.   I really only see that happening if (a) Kim finally gets sick of my sh*t, or (b) I outlive her.   I quit at two tests - they block the spark from here - I had to go through SafeWeb to get there.   Daf

        This is our portrait, taken at the 14th Annual Filipino Dinner-Dance. We both look stiff, but it looks great considering the photographer only took one shot. ;-)    I saw  What Women Want  in the theatres with Brian when it first came out. It was actually his idea. Looking back, I'm not so surprised that  urlLink TheSpark.com  guessed he was a woman. I really like it. It was pretty funny. We were actually contemplating on buying the DVD the last time we were at Hollywood Video. They're having a huge sale.     and then, um, well, you know...      We did some of that last night, too !   *giggles* It was make up for the other day. I was being really moody and grumpy (my only guess is that it was PMS, but it came kind of early). Everything was pissing me off. We were over at Brian's parents' house. We were sitting in our lawn chairs on the driveway watching the neighbors blow up fireworks. I was feeling neglected so I ignored him the rest of the evening.. But we made up already.  =)     By the way,  urlLink TheSpark.com  says that I am 33% gay: 2% gayer than average.

         Web Cloggers sounds good !   Our 4th of July:  Played a 9am mass.  Kim was supposed to come, but has been having food reaction problems lately.  So she stayed home, and we canceled a long-distance shopping trip we had planned.  Did some shopping closer to home, rented  What Women Want  (pretty good, not great), did some gardening, surfed a little, tweaked a couple of songs I'd been working on (maybe I'll post an mp3 when they're closer to ready).  I drop my vegetarian routine for major holidays - so we did some burgers on the barbie, had a few beers, watched our movie, and then, um, well, you know...  Didn't see our kids all day!  Sad in a way, but made for a peaceful day.  Our counselor said (Wednesday night) that she doesn't think we need to come anymore - we worked through the "partnership" issues, sounds like we're to a point where we can handle whatever curves life (and especially life in the form of the kids) throws at us next.  Knock on wood, the garden actually looks good this year - first time!  We put down some really good soil this year, I'm sure that helped.  Daf

      I kind of like  Web Cloggers , but we'll leave it open for other suggestions. If there are no other suggestions that are better than  Web Cloggers  by the 20th of this month then that will be the name of our blog. What do you guys think?    Speaking of tests, Brian took the Gender Test and  urlLink TheSpark  said he was a woman. 83% sure, to boot !  I took the test and it guessed me to be a woman also. So basically, Brian and I are a lesbian couple. Kidding !  It's really not that accurate I suppose. Perhaps not enough people have taken the test.    We had a barbecue at our house yesterday to celebrate the Fourth of July. It was a small one. We were expecting just Brian's parents, Brian and I. Brian's mom canceled because she wasn't feeling good. Earlier that afternoon we (Donna, Dave, Kevin, Brian and I) had all gone to watch  A.I.  (it reminded me of  Bicentennial Man , but I liked  Bicentennial Man  better because it actually made me cry ~~ Brian says  A.I.  would've made me cry, I just wasn't in the mood for it). I think the heat may have gotten to her. It was really hot out yesterday. It was affecting my mood: I was being sorta grumpy.    Instead, Brian's granparents (Clark and Betty) and his dad came. Brian grilled some pork chops and we had corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. We also had some cantaloupe and watermelon. Brian and Dave (his dad) opted to skip the fruits and go for Nest Crunch ice cream bars instead. Dinner was really delicious. Brian and I are getting good use out of his grill. I don't regret buying it for him.    We played a game of Scrabble to kill time because it was still bright outside. I won. After Scrabble it was dark enough to start blowing up fireworks. We had quite a few: mostly sparklers, nothing illegal (except for the free firecrackers that the store was giving away). It was a lot of fun. I think Brian's grandparents really enjoyed themselves. How did you guys spend your holiday?

      Hi, everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed their 4th of July. I received a surprised visit from a friend.  My summer has a running theme: getting reacquainted with friends. BTW, Ching, thank you for the invitation. I'm new to this so I hope it works out.  I revisited the spark.com website. I remember taking the purity test a months ago, but I cannot remember my score. I scored 52% slutty on the slut test (with the worldwide average being 46%). For the Gay Test I'm 56% gay (the typical lesbian is 39%). And according to spark's Gender Test, statistically my gender is male. Spark is inaccurate. And I think the people who run that site dislike Canadians.  Names? Web Cloggers, Net Hoggers, Ching's Loggers

          Yahoo has all kinds of fantasy sports, Ching - I think I saw about 30 on their list.  Baseball's the only one that trips my trigger, though.    Hey, I forgot to tell you - AIM magazine (a publication of World Library Press, who makes the little missalettes that you see in a bunch of Catholic churches) wants me to write an article about my teen choir.  1500 words, $250.  I'm excited and nervous - probably why I haven't written it yet, or even started.  Deadline's a couple of months from now, so there's plenty of time (famous last words?).   As far as my "published composer" status, that still hasn't hasppened yet, either - contract's signed, but no other info.  GIA (the publisher) told me it could be 18 months - it's been 16 so far.    See ya,    Daf

      Jen is doing okay, Pia. She has her own place (a crummy apartment with no air-conditioning unit only God knows where -- she gave Mom the address after she moved there, but Mom wasn't paying attention or didn't care, probably a little of both, so we don't know where it is). Mom was pretty upset and Dad was really angry at first, but they got over it. Jen has been pulling antics like these ever since I can remember. Mom and Dad are used to it now, sad to say. Matt takes care of Logan for the most part. Mom and Karen, Matt's mom, take turns baby-sitting throughout the week.    Your fantasy baseball team sounds interesting, Daf. I'm glad that it's doing well. I'm not much of a sports fan, much less a baseball fan. I don't know what anything is. It's interesting, though !  Don't they have fantasy football and fantasy basketball, too?

      Gosh Ching! What happened to Jen?! From the way it sounded, it seemed inevitable that she and Matt would break up. So who has the baby now? I hope they are both okay. I can only imagine how horrible your parents feel. It is difficult when you still have to worry about your grown children.  Anyhoo goodluck! I hope you had a chance to talk to her. Maybe you can talk some sense into her.

          My Fantasy Life      Well, there are fantasies, and there are fantasies.  But here's a surprise one for me - fantasy baseball.    A 'net acquaintance of mine was putting a league together, and asked me to join.  I spend way too much time surfing anyhow, and wanted to tell him "no".  But baseball was always "my" sport, so I decided to give it a try.    When I was a kid, we used to play something like this - my best friend Bobby had a board game with a bunch of circular "cards" with a big hole in the middle.  Around the outside of the circle was the player's name, accompanied by lines marking off a pie graph version of his stats.  So, for example, Mickey Mantle would have a big section of home runs, along with a HUGE slice for strikeouts whereas PeeWee Reese had a much smaller homer slice, but also a lot fewer strikeouts, and bigger slices for singles and doubles.  I forget the name of THAT game - it certainly didn't have the word "fantasy" in it.    Fast forward 35 years.  Nobody has games with spinners anymore - there's probably even an electronic version of Hi-Ho-CherryO - and we're not stuck with stats-from-the-past.  So fantasy baseball, or at least this flavor, involves putting a team together, and then pulling their stats every night - best stats wins - but it's the league founder who determines the points.  So he decided, for example,  that you don't get anything for being walked, and that pitchers don't lose anything for taking a loss or allowing runs.    So at first, I had no idea who to draft - so I went for an all-Hispanic/Asian team.  Because of the way the draft went, I didn't get all my picks, but had what I thought was a pretty good team.  Pretty soon, though, I was "floundering" (ironic, in that "Flounders" was the name of my team) around 6th or 7th place, out of a league of 8 teams.  So something had to change.      Nobody had drafted any rookies, so I went out and got the hot ones.  and a few cold-career/hot-season guys.  But I couldn't get past 6th place.    But then I got the secret - it was the starting pitchers.  You get points for innings pitched, strikeouts, wins, complete games, shutouts.  But you only get 3 starting pitcher slots, plus 2 relievers and 3 utility pitchers.  Starters only pitch every 5 days or so - so how do you maximize your pitchers' innings?  You (1) load your bench with starters, and (2) make as many of your guys combined relievers / starters as possible.  (1) lets you swap scheduled starters in every time it's their turn - this is way more productive than keeping hitters on the bench - 'cos you're hoping your hitters are playing every day anyhow.  (2)  Lets you put any pitcher anywhere - so you can have a scheduled starter in a reliever's spot.  Guys with this designation (combined starter / reliever) tend to be last year's relievers, who've been promoted to this year's starters.    So you're thinking, "nice theory, Daf, but how does it play out?"  It took about 4 weeks, maybe 5,  to move from 6th place to first.  The Flounders are  smokin' !  Two weeks in first place, and pulling away.    This is just so cool, 'cos I always wanted to win at baseball, and never could.  First baseman, average glove, no hit.  Even in my old "spinner" game, I usually lost, 'cos Bobby was such a baseball geek.    So, for the moment anyway, the Flounders rule!  All the rest of you teams (especially the naughtybeavers, for picking such a tasteless and obvious name), eat Flounder dust!   Daf

      I agree with Daf. This is a guy who is  definitely  not worth waiting for !  You can do so much better !  I can't believe that your friends are actually telling you to wait for him.. Wait for him to what? Wait for him to grow up? He does not have the right to make you feel low. Why be miserable when you have the opportunity to be happy?    By the way, I don't know if you guys have noticed but I've moved the blog. It's no longer at  chingay.net/groupblog  because  chingay.net  seems to have disappeared off the face of the web..

        Hey April...  ...RUN.  Don't just walk away.  RUN.     The right guy is worth waiting for.  Try to find a grown-up, though.  Grownup is more a state of mind than an age - you can tell if they're grown-ups because  (1)  they know that they can't have a healthy relationship if Mom's still number 1 ("Dr. Freud!  Paging Dr. Freud!  Your patient is ready!");   (2)  They actually  want  to have a healthy relationship; and  (3)  They won't resort to name-calling.  Whatever a "Puta" is.  Sounds like something less than a compliment.   And how did I wind up being the only one here who doesn't know Tagalog?  Daf

       ching, here's a very long entry. you wanted me to elaborate, rite? i pulled it from my diary.   AUGUST 5, SAT  louie broke up with me! yea, for real.... he was constantly confusing me on whether he really loved me or maybee he thought he loved me crap so, the day before our TWO YEAR-SEVEN MONS anniv we fought on the fone. both of us have been working alot, seeing less of each other, and frankly, we have been sooo happy and not fighting at all  after some silly statements, at the end he said that i was a bitch. i told him he did not mean it...and that he doesnt knoe what he's saying. in restrospect, i think he heard me saying that he couldnot speak english words well that wasnt what i meant i told him i was "bitchin"--nangungulit....not a bitch! i was hurt  hmm....sometimes even i dont say sum words well butt, the point is...he kept saying it, and  he ended up telling me that the reason why my father left mah mom was because of me.....a bitch! he kept calling me PUTA....PUTA.... he wouldnt stop!!! so, i made a remark, bent on revenge: i told him not to compare me to his mother.   his mom is really a prostitute....she asks money in return for sex....up to now, here in htown  he told me that his mother will always be first in his heart and his life. why??? dont really ask me, because ive been asking myself that how can you love someone that try to kill you even before you were born? and up to now? yea.....malas ko ano. so, he did not talk to me for like five days. last nite, we went out tho watched rush hour 2 nothing happened and it was sad to be next to each other without holding hands or sharing a coke see, i know u probably calling me stupid for even setting up myself to a never-ending fall but, gurl, i wanted to see him baddddd to prove whether he loves me still or he has definitely deleted me out of his life and what to do with the car. i lent him my name...my credit. i know....mistake ***sigh*** well.... i failed to get any of those at least he's talking to me and u kno, i havent cried as much that's a first. u wanna knoe another one? well, i havent begg him to come back not once i did tell him tho that cool off to me means were still together just sorting things out but he wanted a break up and to date other girls...play the field... be free... why are guys like that? i know we're still young and that's why i never told him no... because if we ended up together, i wouldn't be blamed for him missing out on anything. i sabe to him that i will wait for him however; IF he goes and messes with another then he should not even try to woe me but tell me to stop hoping he promised lets just hope that this is the one he keeps  at least this butt, i pray to GOD that  he does not regret or pay for his decisions bec im starting to think that i can live my life without him   ***LAKE SUMMERViLLE*** AUG. 25  to make ammends for not taking me to the  FRiO RiVER with him, LOUiE invited me to go jet-skiing with his bball crew. i went.. it was weird. LOUiE  i were acting as if we were a couple... well, it was whenever he felt like i mattered. he left me to fend for myself many a times. i survived..... he came close to me, held my hand, kissed me, and all that. butt when he started groping my body, i almost slapped his face! like the numbness i felt, my face showed no emotions with each thrusting sexual move he tried to enact underwater.... making rude comments on whether we never did it at a lake or if i missed his company in my bed. i told him we already broke up, di ba??? and he would ignore me.   enihow, he proceeded to be lovey-dopey with me. i played along.... thinking maybee i can hurt him in his own game. he told me that he had lots of girlfriends... but i am his GiRL forever.   i got bruised and beaten-up bad because LOUiE thought he was an experienced jet-skier. he even enraged LiN --one of the nice gurls who was responsible and spent money on the trip-- we ended up stuck in the middle of the lake. LOUiE rode away....left LiN  i to be dragged-off to shore. my arms hurt and i drank lake water..... awful!!!! then he tells us, that when we were cursing his name, as we were being pulled by his careless driving, he got hurt. ***scoff*** um.....i'm so sorry, i'd forgotten how sensitive he was.   get this.... he will marry me eventually. if and when he forgives me, he'll decide to take me back!!! aite.....that was the last straw. i am going to make this bad boi bleed. i will finaLee bee the bitch he tells everybody i am, and teach him one of life's lessons. "be humble."   it bothered me that the people there where being misled... but it turns out, that i was the one that was being fooled. they said: "mabait ka pala. you're nice naman." sooo....what has LOUiE been telling them? this weak wolf in sheep's clothing confused the hell out of mah mind!! in front of people, he's exactly like his brother MiCHAEL, all angelically good, but depressingly rotting of evil inside. ***scoff*** humff, he had the audacity to force me to drive home. i said i couldnt because if i opened mah legs i would have a major accident. he said that i was a problem. that he wouldn't have driven if i was not there, that this is the last time he would aske me out. um.....missing something here!!! i DID NOT ask him to take me with him. and he does not have the power to make me feel low. i told him that he was pathetic to even play-off being all macho and respected. he was neither.

      April, it depends on the nature of the break up. If YOU screwed up, then YOU have to take him back.. If HE cheated on YOU, then you're not obligated to take him back. If the break up was over something really petty, then it's worth taking the time to work things out. Brian and I always work things out. He doesn't believe in running away from your problems. He doesn't believe in just throwing all that you have worked for away.. Like I said, it depends on the circumstances. I am not going to pry, but you are welcome to elaborate on your situation.. Perhaps then we will be able to give you more suitable advice.

Yesterdy was my 13th day of working straight, and having the weekend off does not justify my having a b*tchiE manager. im happee cause you guys are happee ('o',)

      I agree with everyone's advice. Brian and I have both had our share of failed relationships. The key is to learn from each experience and grow as a person. Stay positive.. Don't dwell on the negative. Keep yourself busy. And when you least expect it, the right person will come along.

      Hi, April! I have to agree with Daf's "stuff that'll heal the hurt" list. I heard a story about a man who asked his mother, "How can I find Miss Right?" His mother replied, "Become Mr. Right."    You can take this opportunity to become a better you or enjoy the aspects of yourself or your life your fiancee could not appreciate. You now have more free time to be with friends and family. You now have more time for hobbies and activities. You can try something new, learn something new, do something new.      Become Ms. Right...Date Yourself....And Be Good to Yourself.

      That's a beautiful story, Vince !     By the way, our barbecue was a blast.. Except Richard lost his keys.. It was about 1:00 AM. Time to leave, when Richard suddenly realizes that he doesn't have his keys on him. We looked everywhere: on the couch where he and Daniella had been sitting, in his car, on kitchen counter.. We looked everywhere !  Then we thought maybe he left it in Jeff's (Jeff = Richard's roommate) truck because they were outside chatting earlier in the evening.    Kevin, who had stayed around also, ended up driving the three of them (Richard, Daniella and Mike = they all rode together) home. Brian and I strip and go to bed. At 2:45 AM we are sound asleep (totally) when the doorbell rings. I didn't even make an attempt to get up. Besides, I was feeling too lazy (and sleepy) to put my clothes back on. Brian scrambles to put his bristols (clamdiggers for men) on. From my half-closed eyes I get a glimpse of Mike as he walks past the door.    "What was that about," I mumble as Brian returns to the bed. "Richard's keys weren't in Jeff's truck," Brian tells me. "They're checking the yard right now."    The following day I find out that Richard had found his keys (thank, God ! ). It was laying in the grass out on our backyard all along ~~ where they had been rough-housing (Richard got a birthday-beating.. It's supposedly a tradition between Richard, Jeff and Mike from way back when.. The three of them went to high school together). Brian paid for it that day. He has to wake up early and be at work by 6:00 AM. He was late. He didn't get in trouble, though.. I don't think. At least, I hope not.

      THE STORY OF ROSE  The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, "Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?" I laughed and enthusiastically  responded, "Of course you can!" and she gave me a giant squeeze. "Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?" I asked. She jokingly replied, "I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel." "No seriously," I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. "I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!" she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this "time machine" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped all of her 3 x 5 note cards. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, "I'm sorry I'm so jittery.  I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know." As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, "We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one  productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and live life to it's fullest each day to achieve my dreams, I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly rarely have regrets for the things we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets." She concluded her speech by courageously singing "The Rose." She challenged each of us to study the lyrics. At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral -  a tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by  example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.

GREET ME !     August 10th marked mine and Brian's second anniversary. We celebrated yesterday, the 11th.. He was all secretive about what he had planned for us for the whole day. Our first activity was one-hour, full-body massages for the two of us at Sveta's. After that we went on a picnic at Sedgwick County Park. We then went to see a movie of my choice (because Brian said it was my day and I got to decide everything)..  Legally Blonde . It's a really cute movie. We went home, took a shower, got cleaned up.. Dinner was at 9:00 PM and then we went dancing at America's Pub after that. Brian, who usually hates dancing, danced with me all night. I was so happy !  He really made my day !

      The Seven Dwarfs visit The Vatican  The Seven Dwarfs got of the plane and were greeted by the Pope.  On their way to Luggage Claim Dopey asked the Pope: "Your Excellency, are there any midget nuns in the Vatican?"  The Pope says" Nope."  This disturbs Dopey.  "Your Highness" says Dopey, "Are there any midget nuns in Italy?"  "Im afraid not." says the Pope.  Again this disturbs Dopey  "Okay, are there any midget nuns in the world?" asks Dopey  "Afraid not" sighs the Pope.  Suddenly in the back of the pack the other six dwarfs were laughing out loud.  "What is so funny?" says the Pope? One of the dwarfs replies, "Dopey fucked a penguin, Dopey fucked a penguin."  ~Net

      I heard Kevin Smith is coming out with J  Silent Bob movie. Isn't that cool? I saw the Chasing Dogma comic book you mentioned at this really cool comic book store in Berkeley called Comic Relief. Speaking of comic books, I saw Ghost World last night. It was funny. The character Enid sorta reminds me of Daria. The movie is speckled with oddball characters and chockful of sarcastic wit.

      I don't remember how much it cost, Pia. Fred just sent me the ticket. I think he got it for free because of all the frequent flyer miles that he's accumulated.

      There is no doubt that it will be way cheaper over there in Kansas Ching. The thing is Jeff and I couldn't figure out a time when we'll both be available for a few days of vacation. School will start soon and he has to teach. It sucks I know. I wanted to see you new place. How much did it cost when you flew here 2 years ago?

      It might be expensive over there.. After all, we're talking California. You should get it at a local tatoo place here, Point Blank, when you come visit... Come on, I'm giving you an incentive to come visit us. Come visit soon !  Okay?    P.S. You get to decide what you want.. Just sound off some ideas, Brian will draw something, we'll email it to you and then you can decide if you want it done. How does that sound?

      That's funny !  I've seen another hands-free kit that comes with masking tape. Personally, I prefer the rubber band because it won't stick to your hair like tape does.  =)    Gimme a break, Daf !  I feel tubby because I'm so short.. I'd need to be a "0" to look right !  Wouldn't want to be as skinny as my sister is, though.. She looks like she hasn't eaten in months !  Street drugs will do that to you.. Kidding !  I don't know if she's still using. I really despise her lifestyle, but we've all given up at this point.        Hey !  Check this out !  This is a drawing of Brian's that his friend Josh is getting tatooed on his back. It's so cool. I've seen it partially finished (just the black out-lines).. Josh will return to get the colors filled-in shortly. It's so huge. There's going to be lots more he says.. He's going to put a background (a heavenly backdrop on one and hellish one on the other) and everything.. He will be a walking mural soon.

      I was driving home late from the Melville office when all of a sudden sounds of sirens and lights flashing behind me.  I was on my cell phone.  The police officer told me to pull over.  For those of you that might not be in the know, New York State and Suffolk county has issued a cell phone ban while driving a car.  The lady officer informed me of why I was pulled over.  It didnt occur to me that they would be flagging down drivers at such a late hour - which was 1 am!  I got a summons for 175 smakaroons and a word of advice from the officer to get a hands free device.  I thanked her for her concerns and drove home.  Got home and reading e-mail I got this offer for the newest hands free device in circulation.  check it out!!!

       Express makes me feel so FAT !      I've been wanting these hip-slung, light-weight jeans from J.Crew for a while now (a while = 48 hours).. but the money is tight (the jeans are $68 bucks) and I can't afford to be buying everything that I want on whim.  Anyhow, I saw this add in a catalog for some Levi's 518 jeans.. I was like, "Wow !  Only $42 dollars !   This is it.  We're there ! "    So we go to the mall right after we drop my friend Misty off at the airport (a whole 'nother story in itself).  We went to both Dillard's and J.C. Penny with disappointing results.  The good thing was, they were cheaper at the mall.  At Dillard's they were only $35 and at J.C. Penny they were $29.99 ~~ shows you how much of a difference it makes going to the right store.  The bad news was that it didn't come in my size:  Levi's 518 don't come in S (short length).  I so wanted to cry !   More and more, those $68 hip-slung jeans from J.Crew were looking good.    Brian talks me into going to Express. I hadn't been there in a while..  We try to stay away from Express because everytime I go there I end up dropping $200. This time around I only spent $60 and got a pair of jeans, a v-neck shirt, and a $25 Fast Cash coupon (for $25 off any $50 purchase) out of it. Not bad, considering that for $70 all I would get from J.Crew would be a pair of jeans (and a $10 gift card ~~ it's their current promotion).    I'm a 3/4 in Express jeans (in skirts, I'm still a 1/2), though !  Can you believe it?  At least J.Crew jeans make me think I'm really a size 2.  I still like those hip-slug, light-weight, aged denim jeans, though..So today, I'm going to return a pair of J.Crew jeans that I received the other day and exchange them for the new ones that I like !   =)

       Jess named her after my sister Alison, her favorite aunt, who died 12 years ago of Hodgkins'.  I guess actually calling her Alison had a little too much emotional baggage with it, so she used a variation instead.  Works for me, but MY mom gave her a bunch of crap about it - "Baggage? Why would there be baggage?  Alison would be a wonderful name!"  And she wonders why Jess never calls her.  If I'm a PIA like that when I'm in my 70's, I sure hope someone gives me what for.  Mae is 'cos both Jess and Tom were born in May, and it had a nice ring to it.  And I was wrong - the baby is Alyssa Mae Ostrander - she took Tom's last name.  Also worked for me, though Kim didn't seem thrilled about it.  Anyhow, they're home with us now, and life is good, at least for the moment...  Daf

      Congratulations, Jay !  Alyssa seems to be a really popular name. Just recently, my new boss Carroll became a grandmother herself. Her daughter's baby was named Alyssa Marie. I really like the name Alyssa. I'm contemplating using the name for my first daughter, too.    By the way, have you all seen  Planet of the Apes  yet? It's really good. I liked it a lot !     P.S. Net, if you get TFC (which is the only way one can get TV PATROL if one doesn't reside in California) you'll be able to watch it.

      Net, here in the San Francisco Bay Area there's a tv channel that has various ethnic programming (in Chinese, Vietnamese, East Indian, Japanese, etc.). From Monday through Friday, Filipino programming comes on around early evening 5ish PM, one show that is on is called TV PATROL. My tagalog is very poor, but from what I gather it's a sensationalistic Filipino news program. It has things like miracles seen near a statue of the Virgin Mary or a feature on circumcision on young boys or some gossip on actors. But on occassion it also has news clips on government and one time I saw them show the Mayon Volcano eruption.  I don't like watching that channel because I cannot understand most of it. No one in my family is a good translator. If anyone has seen TV PATROL, correct me if I'm wrong cuz when I see/hear news from the Philippines I'm not really sure what is true and what is tabloid anymore.

       Hey Ching!   I'm still agnostic on the details.  We're trying to know the unknowable, prove the unprovable.  As (my hero) Douglas Adams pointed out, a God who requires faith of his people isn't going to provide proof, 'cos then who needs faith?  I chose Catholicism (after growing up Presbyterian) so I could worship with my wife and kids, and 'cos I like some of the Catholic music, and they invited me to play in their ensemble.  I accept our theological assertions as possible, but, of course, unprovable.   I spent a long time away from the church... 18-28, I think.  And really only active in the last 9-10 years.  It was easy to walk away, and kind of hard to come back.  Glad I did, though.   And you may have heard this before, but atheism requires as much faith as the most stringent forms of Christianity, because atheists are saying, essentially, that they believe there's nothing beyond their perception or understanding (or that they understand the things that ARE beyond their understanding well enough to know that whatever causes them, it's NOT God).   In my case, I was visited, near as I can tell, by the Holy Spirit, who gave me a fully arranged 6-part-harmony gospel-style setting of the Gloria.  I'd never composed anything even halfway good before, then all of a sudden BAM!  Woke up in the middle of the night, song wouldn't go away for 3 days, 'til I finally sat down and charted it out.  My choir (this was back before I was a director) loved it, and it brought down the house when we debuted it Christmas Eve 1996.   So it's easy to believe when something like that happens to you.  It's much tougher without any overt contact - then it REALLY takes faith.   Sorry if any of this sounded like preaching.  Not my intent.  I'm glad to see you've got an open mind about it!     And I hope your sister straightens out soon.  Her baby needs her clean and sober.   Daf

      Those are wonderful services that you mentioned. As you all know, I am an atheist..  But I'm leaning more and more toward agnosticism of late. Life is just too magnificent. I compare my life to the less fortunate and I just can't help but be thankful. I don't think that it's all a coincidence either. There's got to be a higher power out there watching out for me !  Brian, on the other hand, has always believed in God. He used to always tell me, "How can we be together for ever, if after you die you just turn to dust? I'll be in heaven all by myself ! " Brian doesn't go to church, but we have resolved to start attending church soon to give our future children balance. When they are old enough to make a decision, we will allow them to choose whether or not to continue attending.    Brian's brother Kevin recently lost his job at Sam's Club. He has had a difficult time finding employment because of his felony (teenagers, drug possession). They are working on an expungement. In the meantime, several potential employers have turned him down because of this. He began attending church again.. A good thing.  We are hoping that this will help turn his life around. He is kind of stuck in his high school days (he is my age -- we went to the same school and belonged in the same class -- class of 96 -- we never knew each other, though). He even used to date girls that were still in high school (up until recently) to his parents' dismay. We are all hoping that he'll grow up and mature and look to the future, instead of looking back at the past.    Our siblings aren't really the creme of the crop.. But Brian and I have both decided to still give them the privelege of being Best Man and Maid of Honor. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, however, we have enlisted the aid of a couple of friends. Richard, who is one of the groom's men will be assisting Kevin and Misty, a friend of mine from work and one of the bridesmaids, will be assisting Jen.    Speaking of Richard, he and his fianc Daniella, came over for dinner last Sunday. Yes, they are now engaged !  Initially the plan was to gather all their friends together and propose to her on Valentine's Day (he had already purchased the ring and was just going to hang on to it until then).. However, in light of everything that has happened, he proposed to her on September 11, fearing that if the shit hit the fan, he might not have the opportunity to profess his undying love and affection (think  Forever Young  -- he's just as big of a movie buff as Brian and I are). Anyway, I cooked Menudo for us (I cook a whole bunch, too, anticipating that Jeff -- Daniella and Richard's roommate -- and his girlfriend Karen were coming). Karen was going to bring Flan (one of my favorite desserts), but due to some unexpected complications neither Jeff nor Karen were able to attend (long story, I may tell you later). We played some chess (Daniella recently learned how to play, Richard is playing even more frequently now). I invited Jen to come over and help eat the food.    Speaking of Jen, she arrived bawling.. About that whole thing of being forbidden by Matthew to see their son. Are you ready for this? (You are about to hear Jen's account of the whole situation.) Matt and Jen and their friends Russ and Cora (another couple -- Matt and Russ are best friends and were roommates for a really long time) and Jude (Matt's brother) got together one night and they were drinking (and probably doing drugs, too, knowing Jen) and they got really fucked up. Cora got a bug up her ass and wanted to flash Matt and Jude (yes, they were really fucked up). They were saying that she could on one condition: Jen must mess around with Russ (yes, they were really, really fucked up -- either that or they're just plain stupid -- then again, it might be the second one). A person of sound mind would think, "Gee, this must be the guys' way of deterring Cora from making a complete fool of herself ! " but my  retarded  sister takes it literally and goes on to mess around with Russ. Granted, Matt should have known better. He knows how stupid and unstable my sister is.. I'm beginning to think that he might have done it on purpose to find reason to get mad at her and forbid her from seeing Logan -- but then, I can't convince myself that he is both that smart and that conniving. So anyway, Matt popped a gasket and there you have it. Jen is now talking to a lawyer about taking primary custody over her son.. Which Brian and I both think is a bad idea, knowing her history and knowing how little she cares for him. What do you guys think?

      I attended my sister's lingerie party. My sister is practical. She just wants Soen brand cotton briefs from the Philippines. Instead I bought her leopard-print undies simply because she whispered that's what her fiance would want (for her to wear--not him! j/k) The party was fun. I have never seen so many pink striped boxes and bags before. By the looks of it, it seems like most of us got the idea of going to Victoria Secret's.     Anyway, I talked to Liz, her maid of honor. She said that she has three sisters and each of them chose a best friend or a close friend to be their maid of honor. She thinks it's really ought to be the future bride's choice. If you really have doubts about Jen, stick with getting a best friend or close friend you can count on. The maid of honor is like the assistant to the bride. She helps with a lot of the preparations--she plans the bridal shower and what-not. It's not unheard of to have both parents walk the bride down the aisle. I think I saw it done a few times while viewing others' wedding albums.    Jay, great write-up! I wish I was there for that service as well.    There was a great thunderstorm in the Bay Area last night. The flashes of lightning and the roar of thunder frightened my mother. She postponed our appointment with the seamstress. We had a blackout, and we stumbled around looking for flashlights and candles. We listened to my auntie's battery-operated radio. The lights came back on a hour or so later.    Well, that's it for now.     Be good to yourself and each other.    Peace, Glee

We had one yesterday in Detroit (downtown's         about 55 miles from my house). Here's the writeup I did         for one of my church music lists:           It wasn't Yankee Stadium, and Pavarotti wasn't there, but it was a glorious worship experience nonetheless.  My soul was well-fed and nurtured.  About a thousand of us jammed into Fort Street Presbyterian Church in downtown Detroit at 4pm on Sunday to pray for peace, justice, and reconciliation.  Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Muslims, Lutherans, Sikhs, Methodists, Hindus, Presbyterians, Baha'i, Orthodox, and more, all praying for the healing of our nation.  Music was provided by the 100+ voice Spiritual Day Tricentennial choir (this year is the 300th anniversary of the founding of Detroit), a number of cantors (or other faiths' versions of cantors), and a very active assembly.  15 - 20 different folks led us in prayer, and provided reflections, including Cardinal Maida, who gave the statement of purpose.  The high points: ALL the music!  (list below) Baptist Rev. Edward Branch's reflection about where God calls us; Presbyterian Rev. Arlene Wallace Gordon's prayer, based on Ps. 24; Imam Abdul Hakim Jackson's reflection about Abraham, our common ancestor in faith (best snippet for the day - always act in faith and obedience, let God provide the results); Prayer litany led by 3 middle school kids - one Muslim girl, one Jewish boy, one Christian girl the common thread through ALL the prayers and reflections - the shared faith and purpose that unite us.  Here's what I know of the song list:  Prelude:  Spiritual Day Tricentennial Choir (I only caught the tail end, and did not recognize the songs, but participated where I could, when invited) Opening: America the Beautiful, assembly and choir Hymn: O God, Our Help (St. Anne, new verses by Carolyn Gillette - I'll put them below with copyright info), assembly and choir Musical Interlude:  Battle Hymn (cool arrangement for B-3 and drums), choir ..........................:  Total Praise (Smallwood), choir (those of us who know (and LOVE) this joined in) Chanted prayer by Jeremy Campion of the Muslim Unity Center Chanted prayer by (n?) from the Hindu temple Closing: T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer), cantor Stephen Dubov of Temple Beth El and assembly - lyrics below   O God Our Help, extra verses: ----------------------------------------------- O God, our words cannot express the pain we feel this day; Enreged, uncertain, we confess our need to bow and pray.  We grieve for all who lost their lives and for each infured one; We pray for children, husbands, wives whose grief has just begun.  O Lord, we're called to offer prayer for all our leaders, too; May they, amid such great despair be wise in all they do.  We trust your mercy and your grace; In you we will not fear! May peace and justice now embrace!  Be with your people here!  copyright © 2001, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette, 305 S. Broadway, Pitman NJ 08071.  All rights reserved.    T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer) ----------------------------------------------- May we be blessed as we go on our way. May we be guided in peace. May we be blessed with health and joy.   May this be our blessing.  Amen.  May we be sheltered by the wings of peace. May we be kept in safety and love. May grace and compassion find their way to every soul. May this be our blessing.  Amen.  (no copyright info given)  Jay

      April, youre getting married?  I thought you just broke up with THAT guy?  As far as moms walking their daughter up the aisle, I feel that its no big deal.  My mom walked my sister up the aisle since my parents are divorced and my sister insisted that Mom do it not DAD.  As you might filter, my sister holds a lot of animosity towards my dad.  My brother in law even tried to settle the disagreements but my sister Marie just wont have it.  The market is up right now.  I hope it stays there.  For those of you that are watching the economy, pay close attention to those Oil Futures.  If they start rising significantly, be prepared for a war with IRAQ.  Ching, what a mess Jen has made.  Awaiting the further exploits...  ~Net

      Speaking of walking down the aisle, my mom, who is not to be out-done, wants to walk me down the aisle (or down to the garden -- because it's going to be an outdoor, garden wedding) too.. So I guess she and my dad are  both  walking me to meet my husband-to-be. My sister, who I guess will be my maid of honor (still thinking about it, though), continues to dodge one catastrophe over another. First, she and Matt (the father of her baby) break up; then, she moves back in with mom and dad; a week later, she gets kicked out of the house; mom and dad do not want anything to do with her; she and Matt are friends again; mom and dad begin to tolerate her again (she actually weazeled some jewelry out of mom and my father's laptop -- even after all that went down -- can you say "spoiled" and "manipulative" ??? -- I don't care, though -- whatever will make her get her act back together -- I just feel sorry that her life is all fucked up -- then again, all our lives will be all fucked up anyway once the shit hits the fan -- but then, at least, that's not any of Jen's doing -- then again, maybe it is? -- she always has something to do with shit going wrong); everything seems to be going fine; yesterday afternoon she calls Brian and tells him that she and Matt had a major disagreement and now he refuses to let her see Logan. She is devastated of course! Wait till you hear  why  he's withholding visitation rights!  You'll find out on the next installment of.. "Jen's Fucked Up Life"

      Hello. Monday, SF had a Remembrance Day interfaith service. I watched it live. There were 12 to 14 different faiths represented. The most touching speech was given by a Muslim woman who wanted to give a "face" to who Muslims are. She said that she always considered herself a wife, a mother, a neighbor and that it was not until that "Tuesday" [Sept. 11] did she ever consider herself as the face of the enemy. She said the Koran does not condone violence or hatred. Another woman read from the Koran. A minister from the Metropolitan Church representing the LGBT community says that her community understood what it is like to be scapegoated and to be the recepients of hatred and violence. A Baptist minister got the most applause and a huge standing ovation when he said that the Koran mentioned removing "jehad" (sp?) from the self. He said the U.S. jehad is racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia. He said our suffering would not be gone until we remove this from ourselves. At that service at the Civic Center, people of every stripe was there. I have never seen such a peaceful and moving service such as this. It filled me with awe and hope. I wished this was aired live throughout the nation. This is what I felt our country was about. I want to see more things like this. I'm tired of the images of the towers collapsing over and over again. I'm tired of hearing about the violent bigotry Americans are acting upon other Americans.    I cannot get to my on-line diary. This sucks. I posted the e-mail my friend sent me about her narrow escape from the WTC. I am so happy my friend and her co-workers got out alive. Her story was amazing. The way she helped her co-workers was so brave. She's too modest to call herself a hero.   My sister knew that I personally dislike making decisions. She already knows I also dislike formal occassions, and she knows that she would be asking a lot from me to be just a bridesmaid. Her maid of honor is a friend from church who has already gone through numerous wedding preparations before--besides, she really loves doing that kind of stuff.    I think this is your wedding, and I feel you have the right to decide who your maid of honor will be. Same goes for Brian: he has the right to decide who his best man will be. Heck, at a friend's wedding, the bride did not have a maid of honor--she had a best man (and she had a younger sister); and the groom did not have a best man--he had a best woman.

      April,    Its no better here in NY.  I was at my branch Saturday and this lady covered in her robe from head to toe.  She made a black and white copy and looking behind her back just in case anyone was looking. It looked like she was so afraid for her life.  She came up to the counter to pay for her copy and the article was about how muslims were hurt too about the World Trade Terrorism.  She thanked me for the copy and left the store so fast like someone was going to attack her.  I felt a sad that she would be so afraid just to make a copy.  In the news, an american drove into an indian owned store.  I was shocked at what people are doing out there.  Just because they are muslim doesnt mean that they are necessarily bad. May God protect these innocent people.    Net

       Hey April.  We have to stand by our Muslim friends!  They've got to be feeling scared and hurt about all the unjustified crap they're taking from ignorant (!!!) haters.  It makes as much sense to blame all American Catholics for Oklahoma City, since McVeigh was Catholic.  Blaming hundreds of millions of Moslems for the twisted actions of a small group is unfair.  And stupid.  I'm pleased to see our leaders (with whom I rarely agree) reiterating this - we don't have a gripe with Arabs.  We don't have a gripe with Moslems.  We have a gripe with terrorists.

      Great news, Net!  We added Jennifer to our prayer book at church at yesterday's mass.  We had two managers from our company (Compuware) on one of the Boston planes - I didn't know them, but it still tugs at my heart.  Speaking of, I have to play a funeral for a two-month-old baby tomorrow.  SIDS.  She was only a week or two older than Alyssa.  I'm sure she's safe in the arms of the angels, but her poor family.  So I was so ready for some good news.  Thanks for letting us know, Net.   Daf.

      For those of you who dont have Flags.  Go to your Local Kinko's and ask for one its free.  Kinkos is giving away free flags on laser paper.  They will also print flags on vinyl material for 75% off.  I think it comes to about 25 bucks.  Just a little something the company I work for is doing for the community.  Want to have more fun?  Do a Flag Chain.  Print out 5 Flags on paper and give it to five people that you know.  Let those people do the same and spread nationalism!! USA, USA,USA.    ~Net

      Jennifer Chu is alright.  She survived the explosion.  Dot called her parents and they said that she was in shock but shes gonna be alright.  Im trying to avoid the city these last few days. Im staying with my mother in Queens.  Were all just trying to take it easy. Couple of days ago, the wind changed direction and the smoke from Downtown travelled to Queens. I left a window open that night and I woke up with a headache and a bad sinus. Almost like I had an allergy attack.  I took some coffee filters and used it as a mask tieing it to my face with rubber bands.  Thank goodness it rained,  the smoke conditions have faded.  Were all trying to get back to normal.  Monday, will be the beginning of it.  Oh and for those of you who are Jewish, Tuesday is Rosh Hassanah.  The coming week is also the UN Assembly.  Its gonna be a busy week for New Yorkers.  I wish you all a safe week.  ~Net (Cent)

      I feel sorry for those in the Washington DC and New York area.. I feel sorry for the US.. I feel sorry for the current president who has to make all these tough decisions..    We here in Kansas have been pretty much unaffected by it all. There were rumors that floated around about a price-hike in gas right after the incident. Of course, all of us gullible Wichitans lined up at all of the gas stations to fill up our tanks. Yes, I was one of them. Brian's dad actually took it further and went to Sam's Club to stock up on canned goods, etc. Roads surrounding McConnell AirForce Base have been blocked off, making it difficult for Brian and I to drive to-and-from our house and Derby (to take care of Pogi). The checkpoints have not helped Wichita traffic any.    At work we are collecting funds to donate to the Red Cross through our Eddie Bauer, Newport News and Spiegel phone customers. Many people are afraid that war will ensue.. I'm worried, but optimistic that the situation will come to a peaceful resolution. I'm hoping, anyway. Let's pray that this is all over with by the time my parents have to return to the states.

      Greetings from NYC.  Im okay.  I woke up Tuesday and saw the second plane hit hit the other world trade tower!  It was the worse shock that I ever saw with my own eyes.  I tried to call my friend from Morgan Stanley and there was just busy signals.  I watched the rest of the activity on television and saw both skyscrapers fall and after that I was in disbelief that this would happen in the city where I lived.  I could not use my cell phone and the cable was disrupted for like 15 minutes there was no sound just pictures on the tv.  Hope you friends and relatives are alright.  My friend from Morgan Stanley, Jennifer Chu, is still missing.    ~net

      Glee, the reason I was curious was because I didn't know if it would be appropriate for me not select my sister as Maid of Honor. I really don't want my sister to be my Maid of Honor.. I think it will be too much responsibility for her. But I feel that my mom and my sister are both expecting her to be my Maid of Honor. It sucks. Brian and I are both in the same predicament. He would rather not have his brother be his Best Man (because he really isn't), but we both want to follow the norm. I'm enlisting the help of my other Bridesmaids to make sure that everything goes according to plan. I wish my sister wasn't such a screw up.  Snatch  was a really good movie !  I hooked on  IncrediMail  !

      like all other book to movie "Count to Monte Cristo" will probably be butchered.  The director can only do so much.  Plus what we will be seeing is the directors ideas that were taken from the book. If you translate Brad in filipino i think it goes like Brad Pwet.. =)

      Rush Hour 2 was mad funny!  Dorothy gave me the translation while we were watching it.  Its good that they didnt put in dubs or translate it with text on the bottom of the screen.  It takes your vision away from the characters.  Better to have a translator next to you or view it on DVD when it comes out.

      Speaking of movies, Brian and I rented  Rush Hour  (I forgot that I had seen it a long time ago and I wanted to see it before watching  Rush Hour 2 , so we rented it). We watched it on Saturday night and went to watch  Rush Hour 2  in the theaters the following day. Brian had previously watched it with his dad, but he didn't mind watching it again. In part, because there were several Chinese people in the theater when they went the first time and they would start laughing before everyone else in the theater (they didn't have to wait for the translations). It annoyed the crap out of him !  It was a lot of fun. I love the out-takes at the end of the movie. Out-takes are always funny !     Tonight's DVD rentals are  Memento  and  Exit Wounds . Both movies came highly recommended.  Memento , by Glee and Louie (our favorite video store employee) and  Exit Wounds  by Brian's father David and our friend Richard. I didn't get a chance to watch  Memento  in the theaters as Glee had recommended a few months ago. I'm glad that it's now available to rent.  =)

      My friend Adrian and Rinna put action figures on their wedding cake.  They put Princess Lea  (Rinna) and Hans Solo (Adrian) as the bride and groom. My friends and I added the extra ones later on, Darth Vader as Adrian's Father-in-Law.  And Jabba the Hut as the Mother in Law... oooohhhh.  When the inlaws saw it.. they wondered who those caracters were suppose to be.   Well it was all in good fun.      Speaking of Steak, Last week was Restaurant Week in New York City.  Dot and I went to Smith and Woolensky with her cousin Kim and Kathy.  For 30 dollars you can order from the Prix Fixe Menu; appetizer-soup or salad; main course- Fillet Mignon; then dessert- Cheese Cake or Chocolate Mousse Cake.  Fillet Mignon is Medium Rare of course but for the 30 dollar price it was worth it!!!  Normally, a Steak dinner will cost around 60 dollars and up on average at Smith and Wollensky.  It will cost extra for the appetizer plus again for the dessert.  I think I spent about 200 dollars the last time I went at Smith's two years ago.   Glee, were you on a vegan or lacto-vegetarian diet?    Net    PS My brother Joe is running on the NYC Marathon this weekend. Volunteer water boys welcome...=)

      Hi, everyone! I'm back! I wanted to see if I could eat a vegetarian diet for 21 days. That quickly ended when I saw my father cooking up a steak yesterday. After a week of eating whole grains, pinto and/or black beans, baby green salads, hummus etc. I got so sick eating the steak. I should've started eating eggs, fish, poultry and then moved up the food chain.    I did not have the Reiki attunement. I already had my Reiki I attunement last year so it would be redundant to do it again. I was only taking this workshop as a refresher course--learn new hand positions and try to grasp what I could not understand the first time around. Reiki is "universal life energy." Many cultures talk about this energy: the Chinese call it "Qi" or "Chi, " the Japanese call it "Ki," and it has also been called "prana." Everyone has this energy, but it in order to be a clearer channel of this Reiki, one gets initiated by a Reiki Master (Teacher) through what's commonly called an "attunement." Reiki balances the energy in one's self and aids a person in his or her own healing process. A person who has an attunement can do self-treatments or do treatments for others.    I don't normally dress up for Halloween. My friend Amy said she was thinking of dressing as Anne Sexton (the confessional poet who committed suicide by gassing herself in the car garage). I said I would be willing to be Sylvia Plath if she would go through with it. (Sylvia Plath did herself in by sticking her head in a gas oven.) Amy has a habit of dressing in "obscure" historical figures. She's gonna end up dressing up as a Bolshevik or a French whore (I can't remember which historical period). Amy said I could dress as a pastry tray, but I said I'm too afraid of being attacked by birds.    Ching, I think Gladys (my sister) and her husband JP would be pleased to be starting a new trend in cake toppers. It sure beats paying 500 dollars for a candy version of yourself.    My mother is willing to get rid of the 70s orange flower-printed couch and matching loveseat. She is also willing to get rid of the oriental rug. Unfortunately, Salvation Army is not co-operating. They keep delaying their pick-up times. Grrrrr.  I swear the house I grew up in looked like a Filipino-version stage setting for the Brady Bunch.    Have a Happy Halloween!

      Sorry I've been out of commish for a while. Things have been somewhat hectic over here. I have not seen  Caligula . Brian, who is very opinionated when it comes to movies, has seen it -- but he has no desire to see it again. I guess I am out of luck.    I saw  A Clockwork Orange  a while back. I think I wrote a paper on several years ago. I own it on video and and I have the book which has the crucial final chapter that was conveniently omitted from the movie version. It's one of my all-time favorites.    Speaking of movies,  Final Fantasy  is now available on DVD. Brian and I bought it today at Sam's Club. We had to call his parents to bail us out because we needed to buy food for our barbecue this afternoon and both our Sam's Club cards were expired. And Sam's was the only place we could get 40 hamburger patties for less than 10 bucks !     The action figure cake toppers gave Brian and I a wonderful idea. We're going to be copy cats and use action figures as our cake toppers, too !  Brian loved the idea because he is an avid action figure collector. When I first read your message, Glee, I got very excited.. "I know exactly which action figure I want to represent me ! " I told Brian. He thought I was going to pick Xiaoyu from the video game Tekken (because I kick ass at the game when I play her -- I am totally invincible, except when Brian selects Eddie Gordo, his strongest character, to play against me). He was completely surprised when I told him that I choose Elektra (from Marvel Comics). "Then I'll be Logan," he says. "Wolverine? Why?" I asked. Brian explains that Elektra and Logan had some sort of relationship 8 years ago. Of course, only a handful of people will know the significance of the characters we selected. I'm so excited already. My mom will literally flip out !

       Hi Glee,  I don't like the gory stuff either.  Didn't mind  Clockwork Orange , though, mostly intelligent, a lot of the violence was implied rather than on-camera.  Next to  2001 , it may be Kubrick's best work.  What's a Reiki attunement?  Or should I go look it up 'cos you'll be gone for 21 days?     Daf

      Reply to APRiL: Were you referring to my friend Amy or the weddding?   I think  Caligula  would mess up my sensitive disposition, so I'll pass on that one. The sex wouldn't bother me, the gore would. Because  Clockwork Orange  is one of those movies that is contstantly being alluded in media and in conversation, I thought maybe I would watch it to see what the commotion was about. Is it the kind of movie that would give me nightmares?   I saw the latest David Lynch film  Mulholland Drive . If you like David Lynch's work, then you would probably like it. I don't really care for Lynch's movies. Then again, I don't enjoy being disturbed for entertaintment. My own life disturbs me enough.   Well, I'm going to disappear again. I'm finally getting my business license. So, I'm off to build my own business as an independent contractor. Also, I'm going to go through a Reiki attunement so I will be resting for about 21 days starting Sunday.

       There were a bunch of versions of  Caligula .  I'm pretty sure the "R" version skipped the orgy scene.  IMDB has a bunch of info on it.  Also, the DVD had a "making of..." segment that included interviews with Guccione, McDowell, the director, Gore Vidal (the author), and some of the extras.  The orgy scene was directed and produced by the Gooch himself, and did not involve any of the stars.  A lot of Penthouse Pets, enough guys to keep it interesting, and at least one "little person".  As for the violence,  Clockwork Orange  seemed more beatings than killings.  Not so with  Caligula , which had that decapitation machine (sort of a street sweeper with blades), several bloody murders - one including castration, and a "fantasy" scene early on where McDowell imagines all kinds of naked people dying horrible deaths - an early glimpse into his psyche.  I'd like to see  Spiderman , but  Monsters  is the one we're waiting for.  And  Lord of the Rings .  And  Harry Potter .  Can you say "arrested development"?    Daf

      When is Spiderman going to be shown in theatres? Havent Blogged in weeks... Got sick, dont worry its not Anthrax, just the usual sore throat due to the change in weather. Caligula can be compared to Clockwork Orange as far as violence is concerned.  That orgy scene was just plain porn.  How did that ever get an R rating I dont understand.

      Reply to Ching's post: No, she doesn't pop microwaveable popcorn. She has to get fresh popcorn kernels from the Solono County's crops. My friend Amy has an opinion about everything. She doesn't settle for less, if she doesn't have to, when she knows "the best" is readily available. Weird, huh?     My sister's wedding and reception were both a fabulous success. The food was wonderful, the reception location was romantic with a huge window view of the city and the bay at night, and the entertainment was spectacular: the groom serenaded the bride singing a punk rock cover of the punk rock band's  cover of the 80s song "Glory of Love." We, both bridesmaids and groomsmen, were all surprised he had it in him. Turns out it was his dream to sing in a rock band. The wedding cake was a simple round two-tier angel food with strawberries in the middle. It was decorated with red rose petals and the bride/groom topper was two anime acting-figure characters. I said an impromptu speech about the bride and groom in front of 300 guests. We had guests fly in from Canada, L.A., and the East Coast.   The newlyweds honeymooned in a bed-n-breakfast in the Napa Valley.   They opened their wedding presents yesterday. For some reason the couple has more knife sets than would be considered practical. They also have two disco balls--yes, that was on their wedding registry. Still, it's one too many. I noticed their bathroom and kitchen stuff were either black or silver or grey. I have a strange feeling my brother-in-law has taken charge of the interior decorating. *sigh* Well, my sister and her husband are living in the house my sister and I grew up in as children. (My mother, father, aunt, and I live in the carehome, the place of my mom and aunt's work.)

      More movies:   Cider House Rules  - excellent character development, real tear-jerky, Charlize Theron is hot hot hot (!!!), and the male lead (forgot his name?) reminds me a whole bunch of a friend of mine.  Pro-abortion stance might be disturbing to some, as well as an incest subplot, but very well done.  Best role Michael Caine's had in years!   Caligula  - always wondered what was up with this one - what happens when a star-studded cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud) works a movie produced by Bob Guccione?  Boy, did we ever find out!  I knew it'd be graphic, but the violence was downright evil!  And though I expected sex, I didn't expect stroker porn - but there it was - big 15 minute (?) orgy scene near the end, played like any other porn movie, except slightly better photography, and the sound of Malcolm McDowell hollering in the background instead of a fuzak soundtrack.  Kim hated it, I thought O'Toole and McDowell were very good, though McDowell was uneven.  And I did rewatch the orgy once more, but felt appropriately dirty and ashamed afterwards.   The Players Club  - Tawdry drama set in a black strip club.  Far enough outside my cultural experience that I question my judgment on it, but didn't really ring true.  Female lead was pretty good, and Jamie Foxx was likeable, but the criminal element was really two-dimensional.  Daf

      Finally got the first proof back from my publisher!  Yay!  Minor fixes only - left my lyrics intact.  We'll duke it out over chord changes for a while - I'm right  , but I'll give in if I gotta.  Won't ever get me much money, but it's kinda cool to know that people I never met will be singing my stuff (sorta true already - British music director used a song of mine last year, but I only wrote the lyrics).

      I loved reading the book  Grendel . My friend Albert recommended it to me. I heard the author was a resident of Chico (I attended CSU, Chico), and he died in a motorcycle accident. I loved the part in the book when this ram had this tenacity to climb this mountain and Grendel would try to knock it down. The ram reminds me of my more determined friends. Grendel, the character himself, reminds me of my friend Albert.     My friend Amy rented  Holy Smoke  on VHS. (She still has no desire to buy a DVD player.) Strange flick. Harvey Keitel in drag is just a weird image. Keitel plays P.J. an exit counselor who tries to deprogram Kate Winslet who believes she found love and enlightenment from Bubba, an East Indian guru. Amy made the best buttered popcorn--this side of Solano County.    I'm gonna take a leave of absence in the blogging for a while. This is the last week to get ready for my sis' big day, and I have to supplement my income to pay off my student loan and the mound of bills. Grrrrrr. [hums] Job hunting I will go..job hunting I will go...hi ho...merry-oh...job hunting I will go.

      Hey April!  Like the Mike Reiss.  Wonder what he thought of  Grendel .  One of my faves.  Also like Tom Hanks.  I'm so middle-class!  Speaking of (Middle class) - DVD players are under $100 now, so we bought one, and a few rewatchables we didn't already have:  Caddyshack, Music Man, North by Northwest, Round Midnight, My Fair Lady, Raging Bull .  Rented a couple DVDs too - LOVED(!!!)  O Brother Where Art Thou?   Great  Ulysses  references - sirens, Cyclops, the wife who's going to remarry.  I always liked the Coen Bros., but this was even better than I hoped.  Helps I'm a bluegrass fan too.  And  The Mexican .  Pretty cool plot twists, and some pretty dark humor.  More blood than I like (I like NONE,  Raging Bull  notwithstanding).  Julia Roberts was a little over-the-top with her psychobabble, but I'm sure there are girls out there just like her.  Daf

      When you are old and gray and full of sleep,  And nodding by the fire, takedown this book,  And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;    How many loved your moments of glad grace,  And love your beauty with love false or true;  But one man love the pilgrim soul in you,  And loved the sorrows of your changing face.    And bending down beside the glowing bars  Murmur, a little sad, From us fled Love;  He paced upon the mountains far above,  And his his face amid a crowd of stars.    W B Yeats

      Has anyone seen  Monsters, Inc.  or  Harry Potter ? I was wondering if either one was worth watching.    I agree w/ you, Ching. "Todo" sounds too much like "Toto," and "Burrows" sounds like--well, burrows. A digging dog? Start over: Use his nickname or middle name. I don't like my name--it sounds too vain: "Belladonna Proudfoot."    Ching, do you have a wedding date set?    Being a lapsed Catholic, I can appreciate the aforementioned joke. :)

      &gt;   Two priests are off to the showers late one night. &gt;   They undress and step in the showers before they &gt;   realize there is no soap. &gt;   &gt;   Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to &gt;   get it, not bothering to dress. He grabs two bars of &gt;   soap in his hands and heads back to the showers. He is &gt;   halfway down the hall when he sees three nuns heading &gt;   his way. Having no place to hide, he stands against &gt;   the wall and freezes like he's a statue. &gt;   &gt;   The nuns stop and comment on how lifelike he looks. &gt;   &gt;   The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls his &gt;   manhood.  Startled, he drops a bar of soap. &gt;   &gt;   "Oh look," says the first nun..."It's a soap dispenser." &gt;   &gt;   To test her theory the second nun also pulls his manhood, &gt;  and sure enough he drops the other bar of soap. &gt;   &gt;   The third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then &gt;  twice and three times but nothing happens.So she tries once more and, to her delight, she yells."Hand lotion!

There are 11   letters in "NOSTRADAMUS."     I know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED   CROSS," can't trust them.     I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE" has 11 letters in it,   too! Can someone help?    Anyone?    If so, send me email. No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11   letters....      Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven   letters!!    Nooooooooooo!!!!!!     I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE"   has 11 letters.....

      My brother finished the marathon Sunday at around 5 pm.  We had trouble looking for the family reunion area.  Last year, the family reunion was inside the park.  Due to higher security it was moved to Central Park West.  We got in the park on the East Side and hiked for 2 miles finally finding a route which made us go on a Northern path.  We ended up on 86th street where we heard on a loud speaker that we are suppose to meet my brother at the reunion area on 74th Street!  Dot and I sprinted down Central Park West towards 74th Street.  We spotted a water stand and grabbed a couple of water bottles.  People were cheering us down Park West and at the corner of 74th there were bright lights and my brother in a foil blanket waiting for me and Dot.  Crowds were cheering and we were so happy that we got reunited with my brother Joe. By the way I hope you dont mind the exaggeration in the last 2 sentences.  I got caught in the moment     Net

      Yes!  We do have one in Wichita.  I ordered my gown already.  It was so easy!  I can't believe other people take forever to decide!  I'm just mroe decisive than most I guess.  After trying on 12 gowns and 2 1/2 hours at the store, I ended up choosing the very first one that I tried on.  We took pictures of all the dresses that I tried on.  I forgot my camera, so it's in Brian's dad's digital camera.  He's supposed to give me a disk with the pictures.  I will show them to you.  We have to be really discreet because it's bad luck for Brian to my dress.  It'll be a surprise!  I still have to wait four months for my dress to arrive (it's one that has to be ordered), but I am so excited already!    April, you can get a free domain name thru  NameZero  or  yourname.dot.nu .

       Rock Star  stars Mark Wahlberg (previously Marky Mark, brother of Donnie(sp?) of NKOTB and leader of the Funky Bunch back in the 80's) and Jennifer Aniston (Rachel of Friends). He's this loser who is obsessed with this rock band (Steel Dragon). He sings the songs, wears the clothes and is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon cover band (he insists it's a "tribute" band). When the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the band, Marky Mark is drafted to replace him and the story goes on.. etc. etc. etc. Think Van Halen. All throughout the movie I kept thinking of the similarities: it's like the Van Halen story or something. Anyway, it's really good. I didn't think it would be, but I liked it. It even made me cry.

      My bestfriend is really Sheryll. She lives in the Philippines. You can find out more about her on the  SMEAGHE Today  page also. Pia is a really, really, really good friend of mine. I'm able to stay in touch with her better than I can with Sheryll because she lives in California. Pia and I have known each other since grade school -- so we've known each other for over fifteen years, by my estimation. I met Sheryll during my first year in high school (American translation: seventh grade) and we've been the best of friends ever since.    I'm glad that you like the look of the page Glee. I'd been tinkering around with it for the past few weeks and I think I've found a layout that I'm happy with. Hey, you're a word freak, aren't you? You should go to  games.com  and play me Scrabble. It's tons of fun !     Has anybody seen  Rock Star  yet? It's actually pretty good. I was surprised.

      Net, wish those were real smackaroos, could use them right about now. Gleetv222 was online that night. You just missed her by a coupla hours. What's your AIM?    Why don't they create sculptures in the likeness of those who were involved? I don't care if they were all White. Cities should hire more latino, black, and other people of color as firefighters. When these people of color get involved in another historical event, then they rightfully deserve their own commemorative sculptures.     Pia is Ching's best friend if I remember correctly.

I dont see her tonight. =)     Heres a thought to ponder, Some people here in NY want to erect a memorial for 911.  It would comprise of those firefighters raising the US flag on Ground Zero only instead of their actual skin color one will be Black, another will be Latino, and the third White.  In actuality there were no other firefighter in that situation that was black or latino.  Why is it that when one wants to erect a sculpture of art, some people want to add hints of color?  The sculpture by-the-way is going to be in bronze. Net

      Ching, the web page looks great! Even one of those little characters on the top right hand corner kinda look like me. Well, you wouldn't know. I never sent you my photo. You're gonna hate me for telling you this, but I did send two of my photos to another internet chum, and I even sent a videotape of myself to another internet chum. Yeah, yeah, I know. I've known you longer than those two, and you deserve seniority priveleges. But I sent you my favorite books and xeroxed pages from my diary, that should count for something, dammit! Oh, I'm tendrilling (a word I stole from Susan Swan's novel,  The Wives of Bath , it means rambling). I like the book list segment. You trust my judgment that much to give it its own section? ;)     BTW, Ching, read the latest two entries of my last adventure in the City at OD.    Vince, I'm sorry for the belated response to your offline Yahoo Messenger message. I hardly use YM. I tend to use AIM as Gleetv222. You can put me on your Buddy List for both YM and AIM.     April, I didn't know you are in TX. Jay, remind me where you are located. Vince, you're in the East Coast, right? Was it NY? Pia is in CA last that I remember.

      I loved  A Beautiful Mind . It made me cry. It reminded me a little of  Bicentennial Man .. Probably because the recognition did not come until several years later. I hope you don't mind my sharing this. I thought that since it's based on a true story, most of you would know about it and how it ends. Kind of like if I told you that they all died at the end of  The Perfect Storm , it wouldn't really be a  spoiler  because that's a given. I have not seen  Shine  (and I know I should; Brian has and says it's very good) so I cannot make a comparison. I guess the similarity to  Good Will Hunting  is that they are both math geniuses and the college campus setting.. But that's about all that they have in common. The story that ABM tells is way different. You'll have to see it. It's really good.    We went to see  Black Hawk Down  this afternoon. It's really good. I liked the movie.    By the way, Glee, next time you post something click on the " view web page " link on the left. You have your own special section on  urlLink our blog . Check it out!

      I love sinigang and adobo also. :) (For Christmas, my friend Amy bought me a book called  Sarap . It was a collection of essays about the history and customs of Filipino food.)    Wowzah! You look beautiful in those gowns, Ching! I wish I could attend cuz I have known you for years. I feel like I know you even though we haven't met in person. But, alas, I have to save what little scratch I have for when I move. :(    I want to see Beautiful Mind. I heard it's a cross between Shine and Good Will Hunting. What do you think?    I promised you a reading list. I don't know if you're in the mood to read novels, but that's what I've been reading lately so these are what come to mind:   Some Girls  by Kristin McCloy   Like Being Killed  by Ellen Miller   The Price of Salt  by Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan   Indigo  by Graham Joyce   Po Man's Child  by Marci Blackman

      The date of the wedding is August 10th, Saturday. The venue is Prairie Prines Christmas Tree Farm in Northwest Wichita. They've got a cozy, garden setting with a small pond in the back. That's where the ceremony will be held. It would be great if you guys could come !

      It's okay if he sees them because I didn't pick any of those dresses.. I might post pictures of the dress that I actually picked, but I'm still trying to decide if I really want to post them or not. I'd like to invite you guys to the wedding, but I can't guarantee accommodations. My mom has a small house, we have a small house and we don't have any money. Besides, I don't want to obligate any of my online friends to come. I don't want to be too pressumptuous. For one, I don't want to assume that any of you will actually take time out from your work/life to attend a wedding of someone you hardly know and have never-ever met in person. Secondly, Kansas is pretty boring. Other than the wedding and reception, there's really not much to do here. I'd be totally thrilled if you all came, but don't blame me (for the rest of your life) if you get bored and don't have any fun. I'm telling you now, if you're planning on any kind of partying during your stay, the night life is non-existent.    All that aside, if any of you are interested in attending though, just email me your address and I promise to send out an invitation and rsvp card.

      We saw  Driven  when it first came out in theaters. You've got Brian pegged, Vince. He could not pass it up. Then when it was released for DVD rentals, we rented and watched it again at that time also. And guess what. He got it as one of his Christmas presents.    I took the day off today to clean the house. We are having company over. It's feeding time at Brian and Ching's. You all know how much we've come to love entertaining. We are a couple of suzie-homemakers. Richard and I are making chicken  pork adobo. And I am making pork sinigang with leafy stuff (I don't know what it is called, I normally don't eat vegetables)  bamboo shoots. I even borrowed my mom's big rice cooker so we'd have enough rice for everyone! We'll take some pictures.. After all, this is our first official get-together for 2002. I'll have to post it in my personal blog.

      I just finished watching DRIVEN.  Man I never seen racing that razor sharp.. the graphics was fabulous.  My heart was racing till the end! I didnt watch it in the movies due to mixed reviews but this was awesome.  Brian would want to watch this film.  Oh and if you will watch this in surround sound it will sound like WHOA!!!  =)  Ching, are you going to wear a crown or a tiara? My sister wore one on her wedding.  I thought it was a finishing touch to a perfect day.    This is my second NEW Year's that I have not made the ER's top ten alcohol poisoning story.  I made it through my brother-in-law's party without drinking a single alcoholic drink inspite of the taunting and temptation.  I did get into the Merengue and Cha-cha sessions.      My coworkers have told me that security in TIMES SQUARE was strict and extreme.  You could not even get a back pack in the area.  Im glad the party when on without a hitch.    HERE's to a wonderful NEW YEAR ~

      Brian and I saw  Lord of the Rings  together, but he went to see  Harry Potter  all by himself yesterday. He got the day off and I had to work !  =P Brian and I both want to see  Hedwig and the Angry Inch .. Thanks for the heads-up. I'll try to rent it here. I hope they didn't ban it or anything. I hate the bible-belt !     All reading recommendations are welcome. I'm working on my sister's copy of  The Unmade Bed  right now. It's an anthology of erotic stories. So far, the stories have been pretty good. I sometimes read to Brian when the mood strikes.    Brian and I bought  The Fast and the Furious . He loves that movie !  The effects were great !  And I  love  Jordana Brewster !  She's so hot !   Wedding plans are slowly creeping along. We anticipate to finalize the guest list and order the invitations next week. My second fitting for my wedding gown is on the 27th -- and I am very excited. The gown fits like a glove !  As though it was made for me. My mom was teasing me about it. She said I can't gain weight between now and the wedding because if I do, my dress won't fit !  It really fits so perfect !  The only aspect that needed altering was the length -- as can be expected.    P.S. My holiday and gift stories are posted in my online journal ( urlLink http://ching.i85.net ).. There's lots of pictures, too !  Don't forget to check the archives !

      I saw  Lord of the Rings  on Christmas and  Harry Potter  on New Year's Day. I enjoyed both immensely.    Ching, I don't know if I already told you, but  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  is out on video. I saw it in the new release section at Hollywood Video. With all the activity that's going on, I'm not sure if you have any leisure time to do any reading. But I do have a few recommendations if you're interested. How far are you coming along w/ the wedding plans?   How was everyone's holidays? Any good stories or presents to mention?

      Yes, I met Jessica Hagedorn at the comPAss'  On the Verge: Conversations on Pilipino American Studies conference at UC Berkeley. She autographed my DOGEATERS. I just talked to the main organizer of comPASs ( Committee for Pilipino American Studies). He gave me her agent's information so I could contact her. She has a new book out. It's a compiliation of her two poetry books, and it's published by City Lights (yes, of the Beat generation fame). I'll buy a book, and get it autographed for you, okay, Ching? Now, hush...;)   Now, I'm off to look for possible venues. Tah, tah...

      Wow its been a couple of weeks since my last blog.  One of my sacrifices for let is to lessen my online activities. Its official, my job has shafted me for the second time this year.  First they told us that we will only get 1 performance appraisal this year (means one raise).  Now they might not even give me a raise since the head of HR says our region is now a Level 2 which means we are regarded as a low level producer.- levels of pay is lower. Time to call in the UNION.  No democracy occurring at work.  I am reminded of the time Sally Field stands up on a table and puts up a sign...    ~Net

      Well, now, I'm looking for a spokenword poets/artists/performers for a Vallejo spokenword group I named Phoenix Rising Spokenword Corps. I named it Phoenix Rising cuz that's what trying to survive and thrive in Vallejo is like--coming from the ashes. The soul of Vallejo is dying. Back in it's hey day it was a bustling Navy town. Now, it's dead with a dying economy. People go to neighboring and surrounding cities for entertainment, shopping, art, etc. What I'm trying to do is shake things up. People say there's nothing to do here. I say, "As long as there is 'nothing to do' there IS something to do cuz you have to build 'something' out of 'nothing.'" I have a big heart. People could understand if I want to do this for fame or money or self-promotion. But really it's cuz I have a message, and I need to get it out.   Well, coming up soon Celebration of Poetry and Arts: kick off benefit for DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour, featuring Jessica Hagedorn, the national slam champ Big Poppa E., co-founder of touring spokenword women group Sister Spit--Michelle Tea, and of course, Phoenix Rising. That's my dream...to bring all the arts and poets of Vallejo to commune, converse, etc. with their neighbors--from different cities, states,--heck, let's make it global.

       Glee, you've had a lot of challenges!  I'm pleased you've stuck to it - the prize goes to the persistent.  I made a lot of my progress by not having any idea how bad I sucked.  Later on, after jumping through some more hoops, I could say "wow, I was lucky I made iot through without getting discouraged", because I discourage easily.  I get lots of positive feedback, very little negative - I think it speaks more to the politeness of my colleagues than my outstanding talent.  I actually find my compositions and performances pretty mundane, BUT a lot of what passes for good songwriting and arranging is even worse.  And knowing that the big boys find my tossed-off work worthy of publishing makes me hopeful that they'll like the stuff we actually use in my church even better.  I was supposed to meet with a publisher's rep last month, and haven't had time (60-75 hour weeks on the day gig).  I'm going to try to set something up soon.  Meantime, Glee, you keep it up.  I'll be watching for you on Oprah.  Daf

      I have been writing poetry and short stories since elementary school. My teacher would assign us to do one limerick and I would create over 20. Another teacher would assign a short story and I would write two. I wrote letters to my sister. In high school, I didn't pass notes--I passed 10-page letters to classmates. I kept a journal since I was 15. I have over 85 journals with an average of 200 pages each.    I wrote for the West Wind newspaper in junior high and then the school paper advisor convinced me to be an editor for the literary mag The Zephyr. I later wrote for the Vallejo Sr. High paper and wrote an editorial that won me accolades from the school principal, and literally saved my high school newspaper's editor's ass by clearing up the mess that a local city paper reporter created by making a non-event into a huge one.    I read in several cafes in Chico. My poetry has been part of a Muticultural Humanities and Fine Arts  Club's art exhibit. I read my work on the college radio station and on the community radio station. I won a first cash prize for best essay with my poem "Anxiety Closet." I have been editor of the English Department's Watershed literary magazine. Later, I was published in two issues of Watershed. I have been in various Chico zines including Thrust Magazine edited by R. Eirik Ott, The Mask edited by Cristina Croooks, and CSUC's Women's Center's lit mag Her Own Voice. R. Eirik Ott brought a new type of poetry to the scene. He hosted Word Core open mics. I brought down the house with my poem "My American Tongue, My Ilokano Tastebuds" at one of his readings.     When I went back home to Vallejo, CA, I complained to a friend that I missed having a "community." I meant like-minded people who were into the arts. My friend Jacqui who was a Filipino community activist thought I meant "Filipino American community." Next thing I know I was reading to over 50 people mainly pillars of the Vallejo Filipino community--they were politicians,  business people, reverends, etc. The theme was "Silent Truth." That was the title of the event. Being true to my artistic vision I stuck to the theme and read poems with taboo subject matter, especially to the Filipino community. I didn't get booed. Worse, no one said anything about my work. A few days later, I was walking along the Vallejo marina when a member of that audience, a man I remember being introduced as the senior board member of the Filipino American Social Services, looked at me like I was dirt.    I was dating a punk pinoy poet named Rupert at the time. Together we organized another poetry event. It took forever just to get a flyer approved with the Vallejo Unified School District. My friend and artist Ryan Omega created a wonderful drawing, but for some reason, they disapproved the picture. I ended up not using the drawing and created another flyer with just text. The poetry reading met with a modicum success. I did not get the the young people interested. I ended up with older people trying so hard to be hip. I was hoping that I would get submissions for my zine Pocketful of Misfits, but I didn't get enough quality submissions that met with my editorial ideas. I wanted a zine that would be a voice for the displaced youth--the type that had something to say, but would not go to a newspaper or lit mag normally. I wanted to create something revolutionary--something radical. Something anti-establishment. I ended up with abstract death/suicide poems. And yeah, the older folks trying to sound hip or funny. Yeah, I saw some gems, and I thought well, "maybe." Then I lost the nerve. And when I mustered the nerve again, I lost the money.    I began reading at Booklover's Haven in Vallejo, CA. It was the only sanctuary for poets that wree not part of the arts cliques or circles that seem to deter new blood or anything away from the norm. It was quiet and supportive place. Then I read In Company Wolves Cafe in Benicia, CA. This place was filled with gay punk kids who pretended not to have money. My gay male friend Bobby swore up and down that he heard me yelling obscenities at the top of my lungs into the mic. I don't remember doing such a thing. Then again, I have selective memory.     I read at an Asian American/Pacific Islander open mic in Oakland, CA. No one signed up to read for the open mic. I was a newbie from a different city. I was scared. The hostess said to read as long as I want. I felt so strange. I read almost everything from my stack of papers. When the featured poet finally showed up, I felt like I read more work than he did. It was truly mortifying experience. I did not want him to think I was invading on his turf. He was a queer pinoy poet/performer/writer, and I didn't want to diss him. But somehow I felt like I did him wrong.    Benicia's Roasting Company, Boadecia's Bookstore's Open Dyke Myke, Justice League's pin@y spokenword, etc. Alas, I finally read at my first poetry slam at the Erotic Poetry Slam in Berkeley. I read first as the sacrificial poet. I must've scored the lowest. I knew the women would show cleavage for days. I did the opposite. I wore exactly what a male poet would wear--the same shit he normally wears on any average day: t-shirt and jeans. I spent my entire life dealing with this friggen idea of being compared and contrasted to the talents and beauty of other girls as a pinay. There I was at a poetry slam, and I felt the same thing--this friggen beauty contest mentality. I thought I had the far sexiest poem, the far most challenging to perform piece. Yet, I scored very low. The audience disappointed me--they were far too predictable. I read them too well.     On Feb. 21 this year on my 32nd birthday, I read at Listen  Be Heard for the second time--the first time at Rafael's bar though. They changed location from the Fetterly Playhouse. The audience showed their love. It was warm and supportive. The men's work surprised me with their depth and compassion. Even when they flowed with their freestyle, they had a message beyond saying ho's and bitches and gangbanging. It was about love and observations of life. And I loved them for it--kuyas, salamat. Martha Cinader was impressed with my reading she said that we needed to give me a "title." She and Lecrecia were already hosting the show--there were already enough hosts. She was thinking about it. So, now you're looking at the new house poet for Listen  Be Heard at Vallejo. Rap stars put Vallejo on the map. Jaime Kennedy thought he put slam poets on the map side by side with Vallejo. Nah, I'm going for the big time. Yeah, Oprah...    I wish I could wish something for my mom on Oprah. But there would be nothing Oprah can do for my mom. My mother needs her soul to be cleansed. That's on my mom--no one else can do that for her. My mother is very devout and religious born-again Christian, but she's not in touch with her soul. My Piscean nature could sense this from her. It's like in spite of all her praying, she's still very broken and barely hanging on a thread. It's sorta like having a person go through mediation practice--they are soo focused on how they breathe that they forget the whole point of the meditation and that's to just BE.    You have enough, you are enough...just be...

I'm having problems with gleetv e-mail address. I will have to get back to you about blog templates, design, etc. I'm trying to get Listen to sponsor this tour. I think I first will have to promote Grito Serpentino, a neochicano spokenword and music ensemble, that will be playing next Thursday at Listen When that's taken care of, I think she will be more willing to hear what I have to say. I swear I'm going to put Vallejo, CA on the map for poetry and the arts. :)

      GLEE: Since you already have a YAHOO! ID (gleetv) -- all you have to do is go to  GeoCities  and activate your free homepage. Hosting your blog at  blog*spot  is always an option.. But there are a couple of downsides: (1) there's an ad that appears at the top of the page (you can get rid of the add by paying $12/year though), and (2) you can't upload any files to their server. Let me know what you decide, either way.    Here are some templates that you could choose from:  urlLink blogger templates . Let me know which one you'd like to use and I will get it set up for you. If you have specific design ideas, just let me know and we will create your own custom blog template together.

       Hey, anyone have Tagalog lyrics to "Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee"?  A friend of mine needs it for a multilingual (English, Spanish, Tagalog) mass he's playing soon.  I know hymns don't float everyone's boat, but there's some great poetry there - if a bit stiff by modern standards.  Anyhow, hope someone can help.  Thanks,  Daf

      Glee, I can set you up with a blog. We'll just sign up for space at GeoCities, so it'll be free. Give me a list of possible names that you are interested in. P.S. Don't you think we need a mailing address?

      Hey, Ching and everyone!  I was thinking of updating my Amazon wishlist, but I'm just soo busy. So, here's a list of birthday wishes: relaxing CDs for massage, Ani DiFranco's Little Castle (? or was it Little Pink Castle?) CD, The Complete Works of Audre Lourde (sp?), blank journals, books on Reflexology or Reiki or hilot, pens, stationery, twin-sized cotton flannel sheet sets, aromatherapy candles, organic essential oils, organic cooking spices, vegetarian cookbooks with quick and easy recipes for the single busy person, books on copywrite laws, books on grantwriting...Well, you get the idea. Heck, if you are on the creative bent. Just send me a friendly letter in a decorated (mailart) envelope.    Ching, can you give me some tips, pointers about starting my own personal blog?   I'm going to read at Listen  Be Heard: open mic and jam session tomorrow on my birthday night. My parents are going to treat me for a birthday dinner and then I will have to go it alone at the mic. I practically had to lie by saying I had a business appointment (when I really was going to an open mic poetry event). How long do you think I could keep up hiding the fact that I'm going on tour, creating a book, and aspiring to get on Oprah? My mother is very concerned. She keeps telling me: "Be careful what you write." I think it's her own fears and her own hiya that's acting up.

      I found it !  Daf, this is your actual wishlist link --  urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/2Y0ADCORFQ6QT/  -- the other only allows  you  to view it.. It doesn't show up for other people. I added a WISHLISTS section below DIVERSIONS. Does anyone else have an Amazon wishlist?

        1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?     Spice cake, penuche icing.  From the Betty Crocker Cookbook for Children (1959?)    2. What's your signature dish?   Hot Dogs.  Boiled.  Kowalski natural casing.  Red Pelican brown mustard.    3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe .  Two serious ones.  One, munchie-induced, where I decided that meatloaf mixed with peanut butter (cooked together) would be real good.  Took one bite, tossed the whole pan.  The other, Christmas dinner, rolled roast and Yorkshire pudding.  My (late) sister was tarnexing silver, and the container slipped - Tarnex all over the Yorkshire pudding.  Waah!!!    4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?   Having my sister back.  The food is secondary, but it'd be cool to relive that one without the Tarnex.  Plus artichokes with drawn butter anf homemade mayo, pickled watermelon, Mom's "book club rice" (with Beau Monde seasoning, Ching!), Kim's Watergate salad, and Dad's spaghetti - a three-day cooking process, the technique buried with him when he died last year.  He put the recipe in a church cookbook once, but left out some details - so his was always special.  No red hot dogs, though.    5. What are you doing this weekend?  Well we're past the weekend now, but I knew what it would be anyhow - work.  70ish hour weeks through March.      Daf

      I'm looking up your Amazon wishlist right now.. Hopefully, everyone will build a wishlist. By the way, is it under Glynda or Glee? I'll try to search under Velasco.    Before I forget --       Happy Birthday!!       Good luck on your campaign. Let me know if there is anything that I can do to help (not financially, though). Times are kind of rough, money-wise.    I hope everyone had a wonderful Valentine's Day..

      I have a wishlist on Amazon. It's my birthday next week Feb 21. I'll be 32, but no one believes it. They think I transposed the numbers of my age--23. Well, that's a first. At least, I look I'm of legal drinking age.   I did the Erotic Poetry Slam thing at Berkeley, CA, Feb. 13. Anyway, I think I scored low because I was doing blatant self-promotion. I'm trying to raise funds for my new self-published book DEAR OPRAH. I'm going to do a DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour. Its mission is two-fold: 1)Get me published--alas! and 2)Raise money so I can fly to Chicago and meet Oprah. Any volunteers? I need donations, promotional materials, webdominatrixes--uh, I mean, webmasters/mistresses. Would anyone be interested?

      I came across something that may be of interest to you, Glee..  Small Spiral Notebook . The submission guidelines are  as follows . You may be interested in this also, Daf. By the way, do any of you guys have wishlists at Amazon? I was just wondering. Because I was thinking of linking to everyone's wishlists. You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of things that they want.    We went to see  Rollerball  this afternoon. It was pretty good. I love Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (also Mystique of  X-Men ) !  I still think Chris Klein is cheesy -- no matter what other people say. He's kind of sucky as an actor. I can't fathom how he's landing all these acting jobs.

        1.   What's the most romantic thing you've ever done for someone else?    In '87, when I moved to DC, Kim stayed in Detroit with the kids for 4 months.  It was really hard being apart.  One weekend I flew home without telling her, had friends drop me at the restaurant two blocks from our house, and called and told her to come to the porch - I was having a present delivered.  I walked down the street and up the driveway.  She was in tears.    2.   [pardon the cosmo question] What are your erogenous zones?    Uh, the usual.    3.   How old were you the first time you had sex? Care to expound?    16.  On a church retreat with a bunch of kids I didn't know.  Fran was 17, and, to this day, the most unattractive girl I've ever been with.  I wasn't ready for this, and it showed.  Monumentally unsatisfying.   4.   What's the most unusual place you've ever had sex?    In an Amtrak sleeper room.  A little cramped, but still nice.    5.   Do you have plans for Valentine's Day or is it just another Thursday?    I'll be working.  Probably overtime.  Sometimes this job really sucks (like RIGHT NOW!  75 damn hours this week.  Aaagh!).  Besides, it'll be Lent.  No fun allowed.     Daf

       Finally, 33 years after I first heard "The Age of Aquarius", I saw "Hair" last night.  It was, of course, a bit dated - but it was aware of its datedness.  The movie was made in 1979, from a play first performed in 1967 or '68.  Directed by Milos Forman.   For all the hit music that came from this (Let the Sun Shine In, Good Morning Starshine, Easy to be Hard, AofA, Hair)  I was completely unprepared for how good the performances were going to be.  Whoever the girl was singing AofA at the opening positively roared!  Cheryl Barnes did a deep and beautiful Easy to be Hard, and even the ridiculous Good Morning Starshine (Glitty gloop gloppy...) - sung by Beverly D'Angelo, no less - had a gritty feel to it, helped along by some gospelly sounding harmonies from the other leads.   There was a lot of Broadway style filler and silliness, too - some pretty good, some just weird.  But the story line just blew me away - I had no idea what was coming at the end.  If you can get past the silly parts and the anachronisms, this is a powerful movie - Treat Williams, a Pan-style character through most of this, becomes Christlike at the end, John Savage is an excellent and unassuming everyman as Claude Bukowski,  Beverly D'Angelo is full of surprises as the society girl who gradually loses her frosty society ways and becomes a regular person.   Also interesting to see some TV celebs - Nell Carter, and the house mother from "Facts of Life".  And some guest vocals from Ronnie Dyson and Melba Moore.   The famous nude scene from the play isn't there, but Beverly shows her goodies a few times, and lots of guys get naked - including a very funny scene at the draft board.   Best part for me, though, was the music.  The "hit" songs sounded so much better in this movie than the bland versions from 5th Dimension, 3 Dog Night, and whoever that was who had the hit with "Good Morning Starshine" (ick!).   Now - if you guys want to make Daf feel REALLY old, just say something like "I've never heard of any of these songs or groups or people".   Where's my damn oatmeal?!   Daf

      I was just re-living old web-clogging memories with Brian. Little did he know that he had a semi-famous girlfriend. I showed him the place where one of my old, unrefined webpages (as in, pre chingay.com, which was pre chingay.net -- both domains now defunct) was listed as one of "best of the cyber pinoys." It was at  Tanikalang Ginto (August 29, 1998)  if you must know and it was on Xoom no less. I don't know how many of you remember those days. But man! Those were the days, weren't they?

      Those were some interesting pictures.  Ive never imagined these electic peters would come in different sizes.  What was that game all about - Pass the Peter? Has anyone seen this Pinoy movie called "the debut"?  I've been tracking it for about a year now and for some reason they dont want to break into the New York Market.  They've finally placed screenings in the East Coast last Christmas out of all places Virginia.  Whats wrong with "the debut" producers that they dont want to cash in the movies worth in the larger Filipino Market in the East Coast?  Sorry for being such a pain but they began screening this movie called "Adobo" and it bombed in the reviews.    just putting my 2 cents into this.  Sex toys... coming to a small town near you.

      I was searching for a topic in a Filipino search engine when I ran across this reviewer's comments on Chingay's online diary. I clicked the link and I was hooked. Ching was honest and hid nothing. Often she commented on how she might get kicked off some webserver do to her content. ;)    Anyway, I read her entry about her various attractions and what it all meant. I responded to that entry w/ an e-mail. That began a very long daily e-mail correspondence in which I wrote her a litany of my survival. I sent her poems old and new. She sent me links to hers. I was drawn to her diaries, the way she was drawn to my e-mails. Often she convinced me to have my own website or online journal. I refused.   Soon we were snail mailing each other. I sent her books mailed in packages covered in rave cards or whatever I could find. I scrawled in the the margins of SF Bay Area independent weekly newspapers. We talked on the phone.    I joined her Yahoo! groups. I also joined an e-mail list group in which members took turning writing a bizarre story. If my memory serves me correctly, it was about an anti-hero who wanted to avenge the death of his pet boa who died as an adobo dish. The murderess was a bartender/songstress and a S dominitrax and a celebrity pet killer at large.   Really, I was a goner. I searched Chingay in various search engines. I downloaded her photos and saved them on discs. I wrote e-mails to her California suitor. I even sent her a postcard from Reno and even used the Carson City public library's internet access to contact her and tell her not to worry. I just had a little roadtrip and I was snowed in in Nevada.   We played Truth or Die on AOL Instant Messenger.   Yaddy, yaddah...then she broke my heart: She fell in love with Brian, insulted California, and refused to meet me. Well, actually, she felt lonely for Brian, she thought the Bay Area was very crowded unlike the open spaces of Kansas, and we could not arrange to meet. Anyway, I was crushed. I retreated from the Chingay Yahoo! club for a while. Then out of curiosity I checked it out again. Then whammo bammo, I'm naming one of her group blogs.

      I ran across Ching in one of my AL-ANON meetings.  Just kidding, I actually found her site on the web as I was searching for SKA on the web.  I ended up looking at a profoundly made site and was so curious that other Filipinos were as interested in Ska as was I.  I was known as VinzSka then and still now among certain circles but thats another story.  Ching invited me to her Beau Monde club and another group where we started telling this never ending story about a Cyborg and her Girlfriend.  Um er... or maybe thats another story yet again.  Anyway, Ching is Awesome as an internet friend. Altough we have never met face to face we have talked a great deal online and She and I have faced reality in our own sense.  Thank you for all those years, oh and I would also like to thank the ACADEMY... uh oh.. now Im just wasting time.  Okay theyre telling me to finish up...Okay thanks Mom!.   Peace out!    ~Net
