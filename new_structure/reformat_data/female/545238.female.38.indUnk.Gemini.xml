       Last night I watched the new Ozzy Osbourne show--cuz you gotta love the Oz. At one point he was talking to his son, and he said "Oi lahve youwall, oi lahve you to pieces, but you're driving me mad!" After the show I went to my brother in the den and said, "Oi lahve youwall." He responded "Oi lahve you to pieces!"   This morning at 4:30 I went in my robe and jammies to my mom in the bathroom getting ready for work. Arms outstretched like Jesus I intoned, "Oi lahve youwall." She responded "Oi lahve you to pieces!"   You gotta love the Oz.

       Datline:  Monday, Dec. 16  The Place:   The Warfield Theater, San Francisco  The Event:  Counting Crows  Toad the Wet Sprocket  âSuch a rainy night,â I thought, âThis is a night for pilgrims only.â Down by where I live, there were power outages due to the stormy weather. I grabbed an umbrella, put on my heavy Eddie Bauer jacket, donned a wide brimmed hat, and headed out. I neednât have worried, when I came up the stairs from the BART station on Fifth I was pleased to note that while the ground was wet, the sky was clear.  As I walked up to the venue, I heard the strains of Toad the Wet Sprocket music coming out of the building (I was ten minutes late.) I saw a large group of people standing outside, but the doors were open and no one seemed to be going in. I approached the guy at the door. âYou can just go in if you got a ticket.â I fall back into the group of people to fish the ticket out of the pocket of the Eddie Bauer, and who do I see walking past but Matt Malley, Counting Crows bass player extraordinaire!  Knowing him to be âthe Spiritual Oneâ of the group, I had a greeting all planned for just such an occasion. Placing palms together, feet firmly planted in a yogic mountain pose, I bowed towards him and intoned âNamaste!â I think I may have jumped out at him a little.  First he asked me if I was spiritual, and if I meditated, to which I answered yes, and a little bit. Then he was going to offer me a ticketâno need, I already had one. I happily shook his hand and wished him a good show. That makes two times now I have had a 30 second meeting with a member of the Crows. I know some people are lucky enough to talk to them for a long time, but Iâm so scared Iâm going to act like a dork all I can manage is 30 seconds.  So I go in, very stoked, Toad the Wet Sprocket rippinâ it up by this time. Got my seat up in the lodges, which was actually a very nice place. There is a beautiful fresco on the ceiling and lovely architecture. The people next to me complained about their seats and left and two girls jumped on them, and we bonded over what good seats they really were, they seemed like fun people. In a shameless ploy to expand my readership I gave one of them the URL for this journal. Hey, if youâre reading this, drop a line my way, send a message and tell me what you think.  So, Toad (I feel like a person that was into them would shorten the name to Toad.) rounds off their set nicely by playing their two hits which I donât know the name of but I will call them, âWalk on the Oceanâ and âAll I Wantâ Those are the songs that get played on the radio.  So the lights went out and Counting Crows take the stage. Lights slowly come up and they start with a very Byrdsy-sounding rendition of the old Scott Mackensie tune, âIf Youâre Going to San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair)â  Then:  Hard Candy Mr. Jones Goodnight Elizabethâa VERY good version with lots of audience sing along parts and a smokinâ guitar jam with Dan, Immy, and Dave all riffing up a storm. Adam added some parts (âI know you think its alright, It is not alright with me, etcâ) Richard Manuel is DeadâAdam sang up close with Dan in his face and then he shoved him away. I love those little comedic parts.  Adam was not talking very much. He came to the front of the stage and started mumbling incoherently at the people in front, then shouted, âJust be quiet!â at them. Then they did Omaha with more audience singing. Then he talked about the people at  urlLink Project Open Hand and how cool they were. Then Immy said something about one of them being his friends mom, but he said it in a mocking, falsetto voice, so Adam said, âYouâre such a dick!â Then he said something else that I canât remember, and ended by saying, âWeâve established what a dick you are, this is a song about what a dick I am.â  American Girlsâagain, not my favorite song, but I got over myself and got into it. Rain KingâOh Susanna part in the middle and lots of audience singing. A Long December Big Yellow Taxi New Frontier Good TimeâI could swear Adam was looking at me here. MiamiâDuring the middle, Adam went back and lay down under the piano with a towel over his head. I pointed this out to my new buddies, and I swear when he got up he jumped up like he was gonna jump at me. Round Hereâanother song in the middle of a song hereâsomething about âThat was the river, this is the sea.â If anyone knows what song that is, clue me in if you would.  Then they left.  Encore #1 Time and Time Again Hanging Around  Then they left again.  Encore #2  This time only Adam and Immy came back and Adam said, âWeâve lost our band! Dave, Dan, and Charlie went off to Vegas, and Matt and Ben think theyâre the rhythm section for the Dixie Chicks!â   Then they did Blues Run the Game.  Then it was almost over. Adam was trying to talk, but losing his voice. The rest of the band returned for Holiday in Spain, and it was over.  The lights came up, and they filed out as silently as they had filed in, Charlie and Ben wistfully trailing behind, then only Ben. I was screaming and gesticulating wildly, and I actually managed to get Benâs attention from as far away as I was. He acknowledged me by making the same hand gestures (rock-n-roll horns salute). Then I turned it into a Princess Di wave, and plaintively said, âBye, Ben!â He smiled and nodded. This is Benâs last week with the band, he will be moving back to Athens, Georgia, where he is from.  My thoughts overall: It would have been SO cool if I could have gotten up frontâthis was one of their BETTER shows. Although I would not have been able to chill out and take notes for this reviewâIâve tried it that way, it doesnât work for me. And apparently, Adam, my sweetie and the love of my life, was a little under the weatherâand they still played an almost two hour show, and at no time did he hit a bum note. Thatâs professionalism.   Listening to:  The music in my head (sigh.)

      I have gotten a job at Whole Foods Market, where I will be making a much higher hourly wage than I have ever made. The employment gods have smiled upon me! I even have a week or two to relax before I actually start working there. If that doesn't rock, I don't know what does!

       So, the night before last was the Counting Crows on Jay Leno. My thoughts: Once again a fine performance of BYT. I notice Charlie is chewing a lot of gum these days--I think somebody quit smoking. Adam got to go to THE COUCH and was quite humorous. I felt like a teenager waiting for the Beatles to come on the Ed Sullivan Show.  In Other News:  Yesterday I had a very enjoyable job interview, where I think I killed. If I get this, I feel like this could be the job where I finally make the transition from being a retail prole to something where I can actually use the skills I've been training for. I don't wanna say any more about it till I find out next week. urlLink

      I tried a new way of meditating today. While I was out with the dog, I was sitting in my favorite spot, a little berm in a corner of the park with some trees.  When I walked into the park, I had seen an orange-robed Buddhist monk walking, a reminder to seek for the inner peace within. As I sat down in my corner, I had a little daydream: I was following the monk, thinking "Show me the Tao of my purpose in life, the path of my True Will."  Then I thought about the idea of doing a Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram in the astral--something I've heard about, but I'm not quite sure if I am a strong enough meditator to do it (but duh, I guess I can practice and learn how--I am going to do this.)  I had done an LBRP this morning, and I wasn't facing east anyway, so I basically visualized the pentagrams that I had created this morning, feeling them strengthen a little. Then I imagined my chakras as I was sitting cross-legged, seeming to vibrate up and down. After that I saw an image of the Sephiroth, with Kether being at my head, Chokma and Binah at my shoulders, etc. This also seemed to vibrate. By this time I was feeling an intense sense of well-being.   This all unfolded like a daydream, and I am looking forward to doing it again tomorrow.   And in other news:  I have decided to go back to school. With my sister setting such a good example, I am hungry to get back in the ring again. Since I am on academic "Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!" status, I will have to start very slow, and I will have to go to  urlLink CSM  in order to build my grade average back up. So taking that into consideration, I have decided to take the telecourse "Introduction to Philosophy" and augment it with something called a "Learning Community"--called "Philosophy  Psychology in Contemporary Films."  Also, I have been fiddling with my website a little. It is slowgoing, but eventually it will be something really neat.

       I am so happy that Marion, my next door neighbor came home from Vermont yesterday.  I was taking care of things at her house while she was gone. It seemed like every time I turned around I had to feed somebody or water something or clean a litterbox or walk somebody else.  She has two cats and a dog. I believe I've mentioned Atticus before, the German Shepherd who started me on my new career as a kanine perambulist. The cats are brand new--to her, anyway, they came from the rescue shelter.  A lovely, black puma-like creature named Alex, shy and brooding, yet very affectionate, I have taken to calling him "Alexander Attaturk." Then there is a siamese without a name yet--at the shelter they were calling her "Buffy," but Marion said she  will not  call any pet of hers "Buffy."  NoName likes the garden, and justifiably so. The garden is an enclave of color, with deep purple clematis, clay vases with water lillies blooming out of them, and roses and nasturtiums by the score.  Yesterday I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off, with my own errands in addition to aforesaid duties. When I finally got home at around nine, I had a horrible head/backache. Disregarding the 420 herb that Marion had left on the coffee table, (no doubt in the hopes I would see it) I went to my mom's medicine cabinet and stole a vicodin, grabbed a cold rag, and went back over to watch tv with the pets.  Marion had encouraged me to watch tv, borrow her CDs, play her Netflix DVDs, whatever I wanted (people have a tendency to trust me to stay in their houses by myself a lot. Lucky for them I'm a trustworthy kinda gal.) She has two tvs, one in the kitchen, the other in her room facing the bed. I had been having breakfast and dinner with the pets in the kitchen while they ate, so they wouldn't be lonely, but I had resisted the urge to televise in her room on the grounds that since Marion is gay, I might get cooties (how homophobic does that make me?)  Last night I dove onto her side of the bed in front of Bill Curtis and "Cold Case Files." A cold rag  on my head, a pleasant narcotic haze coming over me as Alex snurggled me lovingly in the semi-darkness.

       urlLink Forever   And to think that he was listening to the artist he covers here, round about the time I was spending all my money at the Record exchange in Burlingame, listening to this same artist and dreaming of someone just like him.  (sigh.)  He definitely has someone in mind here, I heard somewhere he was getting married.  Probably to someone who never heard these songs in their short life.  That's ok, Dave, we'll always have the time I said "Woohoo Dave!" and you said "Woohoo YOURSELF!"  It was love, you know it.

      It occurs to me that I have not sufficiently pimped my  urlLink Launchcast Radio Station .  For people like me who don't feel much like bothering with Napster or Kazaah, the principle is simple:  you sign up, program in your musical preferences, they play you stuff, and you sort of vote for the music you like the best by rating the song, artist, and genre.  It plays further music based on how you vote.  Oddly enough, my station as it stands now doesn't play enough Counting Crows and is a little top-heavy in the metal department (of course, who doesn't like a little Pantera now and again?) but perhaps the more I work with it this will rectify itself.  That would be my only complaint--that you need to get the paid version in order to get different "moods" programmed in so you could listen according to what you felt like at the time.  Another interesting discovery in online music that I've made is that  urlLink Bruce Dickinson  has a radio program, and has made himself over to the point where he looks and sounds every bit as one would imagine those BBC radio personalities do.  Not altogether unobjectionable, as one of them might say.  I found out about this through  urlLink Rocksnobs , which is a blog my inner High School Senior would love to have written.  Of course, they didn't have the internet back then...

      For the past couple of days my parents have been gone, visiting my brother (the one I like , the gay one) in Chicago.  They will be back on Tuesday.  I proceded to spend the first night to myself staying up til 8 am.  Then I had to get started on my plans for my few days alone.   I like to spend time cleaning my room when my parents are gone.  It sometimes involves throwing things out, and moving some of my junk into another room while I vacuum, dust, throw shit away, and move stuff around.  Anyway, the first order of business was to get some storage units. Not just any storage units, but bookshelves for the many books that are littering my floor.  What this meant, was that I had to get some milk crates.  I waited til about midnight to go get some.  Not being sure how the stores feel when you go and take their milk crates, I like to do it on the sly.  So I got my expandable luggage cart, and set out for the Baskin  Robbins at the local strip mall where I had been able to gank some before.  Of course this time there weren't any.  I looked up at the end of the strip, at the Mollie Stone's, I heard some music and voices coming from there.  I assumed it was the people who worked there, winding up for the night.  Actually, it was a bunch of kids playing cards at a table in front of the store.  The kind of kids that sit around at Starbucks drinking coffee until the place closes, then they're so hyped up on caffiene they can't go home and go to sleep, so they go somewhere else and sit around.  You could call them "coffee shop kids", they seem to have a culture all their own.  It was strangely peaceful there, at the end of the mall in the middle of the night, kids with  pink hair and glasses playing cards at a table, at the other end of the tables sat an affable looking security guy.  It was one of those weird quiet moments that I like about the middle of the night.  I occasionally find myself out and about in the middle of the night, and this night's somnambulent errands made me feel a little weird.  I asked if they had any idea which store I was most likely to find some crates, they suggested I look behind Longs.  I did and found the mother lode.  I wished I had a truck and a house of my own to bring a bunch of junk to, because I could have built my own furniture with some of the crap I found back there.  I know one day I will be a serious dumpster diver.  I got six crates, stacked them up and lashed them to my luggage cart.  I made my way home, pushing my cart through the middle of the street.   I am such a weirdo.
