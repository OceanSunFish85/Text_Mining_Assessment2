      This weekend is gonna be great....BEACH!!  hopefully i'll come back not looking like a lobster, haha.  It's gonna be so much fun because my sis ;-) is going.  Woohoo!!  Today was good...got to spend some time with Mom, which is always good.  She's pretty cool most of the time.  I didn't get to go to the Y though, which kinda made me mad..I wanted to go work out.  But hopefully I'll get to tomorrow.  And maybe go swim too.  Well, I think I'm gonna get off here and go do some reading.  Do something productive for once, haha.  :)   its for you that I'm on my knees now daily praying praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing praying one day that you'll be calling upon his name... and even though now it really might sound redundant God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance... till then one love, one God, one way  ^KJ-52 "Dear Slim"   Later  </post></Blog>
