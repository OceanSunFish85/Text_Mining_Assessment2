      my recent concerns:  German, manga, foreign exchange rate, ceramics,...blah blah blah.  Interesting. When you first look at it, there seem to be no connections in these matters But actually, there is. It is........  BANG!    SCHOOL!!   Yeppeeeee!  ...Sorry it's no way exciting  Um...I realized yesterday that I'm pretty enjoying those stuffâ but well, I'm pretty exhausted And so far this week I didn't do anything other than those school stuff. My days are covered with school!  By the way, I hate those words that parents sometimes say(or is it already outdated?): "Students' ( pupils') duty is studying."  Worthless ideas.  Anyway, I'm going to school everyday, as usual,ãas always. After all, school is fantastic if you don't come up with these useless ideas.

      An unremitting storm of all the new stuff is calming down now. The start of everything is coming to an end. It's reeeally exhausting...To get through this storm.  But yeah. It's getting quiet now.  I didn't realize that beginning of an year(at school) is  this  restless until I got to the last year at my school. Well, It's because I've got all the work from the club plus committees that I belong to; Though I hadn't realized when I got into it that it was so stressful to have to work for those different groups at the same time. And then, beginning of the new year was too busy for all those groups... Plenty of work to do, not much people to manage on it.  Anyway.  It's almost over now, so never mind, I'll just forget about that. After all, I love running around for my club+committee; Honestly. Well, it was, really, exciting and fantastic and refreshing.   But one thing that I was truly surprised about was, the cherry-blossom trees that were pink with flowers last week had all of a sudden become green with leaves this week. I was pretty shocked when I noticed that yesterday. Do cherry-blossom flowers vanish that quickly every year?  It's somehow getting near summer... The beginning of spring has ended. In fact, it's getting quite hot lately.   All the pressure from my work stuff is gone with the cherry blossoms; I absolutely heard the start of this season squeaking away into the past.  The brand new year at school is already getting kicked off!!

      Recently I see quite of people are having their birthdays, for some big birthday parties are going on in the hallways beside our classroom. What a big surprise there were today and yesterday! Yesterday was our classmate Ryoko's birthday, and today was my ex-classmate(in 4B), Hiromi's birthday. ***Happy Brithday Ryoko!!***  It was really surprising when I heard loud crackling sounds in the hallway. And then Happy Birthday Song were sang... I think that's a fantastic Birthday! I would be really happy if I were the Birthday girls.  Birthdays should be the happiest day of the yearâª

      Today I went shopping in Yokohama for the school trip in Hokkaido that is coming up next week.(Hoooooray!) But I got pretty tired by the millions of people coming and going by. I hate the low ceiling in the station and whirl of people under it. I often come to Yokohama to go shopping on weekends, but every time I get overpowered by the rush. phew.  So,I did buy something for the trip: I bought a T-shirt.  Yeah, I had wanted an extra one, so I'm happy now:) I've been looking for a nice mature T-shirt, but I couldn't buy one because I've just found a cute one that's too attractive for me... one with big fruit prints that have these funny smiling faces... When I got home, my mom blamed of buying such childish T-shirt. But heeey I just love them, ha ha, so I'll just ignore her! In fact my sister and my dad said it was cute. Never mind that I regretted a little bit about buying the T-shirt...Seeing my mom's face in disgust.  oki-doki. Tiring Day Today=3 I need sleep. Good night:9

      Again about Sleep.  I've discovered some effective methods for forcing your eyes to wake up  *one: Do sit-ups.(tons of it!) *two: Walk.(make sure to your thigh is raised high) *three: jump.(be careful not to be too noisy) *four: Listen to Loud music.(I would recommend Hard core or Punk) *five: Drag yourself in front of the computer and net surf.(don't start on your assignments; wait 'till your eyes become awake) *six: It's better if you do four five at the same time  I've discovered so far that whenever relax, I get into sleep... Ex. When I eat supper, sit down to read a book(or comics), lying on my bed to read a book(or comics),... And I discovered that I also become sleepy when I get stuck with my assignments.  I think stimulating the body physically/or mentally is the key to Broad Eyes  SO, my biggest concern is SLEEP. Still

      Sleep.  eh...How much do you sleep everyday?  Recently I'm having a very hard time getting enough of it. Almost everyday, I'm sleepy. God. I wake up at 6 in the morning, go to school, come home,  and then get entirely sleepy by 9. I have no time for schoolwork!  What a problem

      It's May! Already May.   I guess this April was a good one  an exciting one, a splendid one, except it was an awfully busy one  but lucky one   so, it's already May   I guess I've have to be ready for all the things that's waiting in May  especially assignments and class works:  English assignments, German classes, politics reports, lots of books to read and analyze for the theses class, keeping up with my math class......   and my club.  Actual activity's going to start at our Drama Club, at last.  New members to come, and new script for the coming up play in July.  Already I'm excited    By the way, it's golden week(as said in Japan only;)  is it golden to me?  My golden week is still an pretty busy one......

      This week was like hell... Hell busy! I don't know whether I had gotten through it well.  In the first place, I think I wasn't in good condition; I hadn't had the strain from school trip exactly removed. School trip was more exhausting than I expected. In fact, there were some people that had gotten a cold after the trip; or even when they were still in Hokkaido.  What was so exhausting about the trip was, that it was a group trip. I've noticed for the first time in the six years I've gone to the school trips; I think it's the fact that you're always with someone else, not enough time to be just by yourself. I was pretty excited throughout the trip, but was getting out of shape in the last few days-- My nerves got stressed of the excitement, I think.  And two days of rest wasn't enough for recovering, school started again too quickly--with bunch of assignments!!  Humm...Maybe I should just go to sleep.

      I still felt like going to Hokkaido this week I still felt like sitting in the bus seats, viewing at the mountains and animals in Hokkaido and playing games with my classmates.  By the way I was glad that our class got really united by the trip; didn't we? I feel that we got more opened out than before to most of the other classmates, even of other sex or those who had never talked deeply with. At least I feel I've got more friends than before; I love my class***

      I came back from the school trip to Hokkaido this week. To say the truth, it was reeeeeeally exciting; It's hard to exactly write what I had experienced there...  Well, what I can clearly say about Hokkaido is, the view were so nice and big!!! And there were full of nature. I loved it.  It was... Relaxing, Healing, Clear, Refreshing, Warm, Sometimes Chilly, Sometimes even Freezing, But Sunny, And Dry, Plenty of Green, With Pure animals.   I saw tons of amazing views throughout the trip; I even saw snow still remaining on mountains, and also touched them. But I wish if I could go there in winter, too... I wanted to see Hokkaido all covered with snow A huge blanket of snow in the winter.  I hope I can go to Hokkaido again...I seriously do. In the winter***
