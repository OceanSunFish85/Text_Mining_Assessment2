      Last weekend, i watched this movie. After seeing the cast  production house most people couldn't have resist it. Well, everybody has the high expectations from the movie. Where the movie score goes, I didn't like the first two.... But I definitely identify my parents with Boman Irani... And the story was okay... at the end I felt movie was worth while watching once. When i was watching Hrithik Roshan, i can identify him with typical north Indian Business family guys. They make me remember my brother so much. No Lakshya in Life. Boss, till date he doesn't know what he wants to do in life.  These days reel life is much closer to the real life. Whether it is Hum Tum or Lakshya.

       As my last article mentioned, I am stationed in Chandigrah for next few months. This is one of the most planned cities I have ever seen. Like very city, this city has also some pecularities; the better  bad the better part of the city are: Clean  neat city the Roads Traveling time the bad part is public transport night life In no other city I have seen girls drivingscooter (other than Kinetic) Bikes, but it's too common in this city, and thatâs reason there is no much scope for the public transport, which is virtually non existing in thecity. And one more thing, newspaper- Chandigrah editions are too boring, not much of national coverage.  Like Mumbai, there is not much of shopping places, but those fewChandigrah have are really good one.For people of Chandigrah heart of city is Sector 17. Whenever I ask some one for some outlet, I always get one answer " Sector 17".    This was the discovery made in last 10 days.... hopefully other good part will soon be discovered.

      Most planned cityinIndia...Chandigrah... it's totally different from Bombay.... actually it's totally different world all together.... the better part is.... there is no trafficincity if some one come across the red light on road.... they tell... " So much of rush" man thatâs unbelievable....  worse part is city sleeps too early..........can't even think.... but no other option available.... I am going to miss the movies, the parties....  the people of Bombaybut I am planning to visit Shimla, Manali,Vashno Devi  even planning to learn Punjabi.... so next time when i will be back in Bombay... you willfind Anjana speaking " Chak de Phat de" Punjabi... and makke de roti  sarso da saag... and if anything more than that.... it will be there...
