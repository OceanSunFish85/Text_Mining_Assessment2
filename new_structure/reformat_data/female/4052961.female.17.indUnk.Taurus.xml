        It's just another boring day with no rain, which really sucks because i love the rain.Well volleyball season is supposed to start next week but i haven't gotten a paper for two-a-days yet so i am a bit skeptical. There are so many different things that i could be doing right now, but no i am here at home typing on this stupid computer and taking up precious time. lol. Oh well i guess i really don't have a life, but it's all good i would rather know that i am safe at home then at a party being drugged or something. Since that seems to happen alot, i would rather not risk it and just stay home being boring. Yes i said it i am boring and i ain't afraid to admit it. For all of you who know me would have to agree and for all of you that hate me just shut the hell up ain't ask you.

        School is coming again and it really sucks because now i have to face all the haters again.Man i so wish that i didn't have to it would be the greatest. But being a Senior means i only have one more year before i get out of this God foresaken town.Unlike some people who i am sure are going to stay here for the rest of their lives, which will really suck. this year is going to be more difficult then last because now i have some new haters to add to my list (yes i am hated on a lot which i guess means i am a bad person) but that doesn't matter i guess i can always stay with who is true to me. The world won't stop for you haters, which mean neither will mine.So i guess i should say bring on the haters i am ready. All i have to do is Shake you haters off!!

        Look ok don't get me wrong i loved the V-4, but now i love the V-3 even more becuase we stayed true to eachother and the game you left it wasn't our fault not your's either. But you see you can't wear a jersey you can't play so just please get over it you were still our friend just not in the group you over exaggerated what we did. We didn't mean to hurt you but you took it that way so please just leave it alone. We were good with you but you have to understand we will be even better without you to way us down. So please let it go and let us go we love the game more then you do so please just let us play. Ashley I'm sorry for how you feel about this but it's the way things go. I don't hate you i never will but you have to get over it and let it go.

        Well let me see what is a friend i really truly don't know because i have gotten screwed over by a lot of them. I don't want to say any names but Amanda Gonzalez that was a friend and well i got screwed over by her. Yeah i may have messed up too but not nearly as much as her. Ashley Hernandez ohh that one well lets just say she is kindling Amanda's fire towards me. but i do have some good friends like Barbara Lindsay JenniferNaiser Mari Kristina Sarah NoahGabe ChrisChelsea and Chavez. Thanks a lot you guys for being there.
