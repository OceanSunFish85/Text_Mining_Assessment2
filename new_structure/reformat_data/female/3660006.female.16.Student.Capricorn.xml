      Last night was interesting.  I worked 10-5, and then went to Nate's house to see his gramma and grandpa, and of course, Roxy.  Then we went to my house and drank what we had left from the other night, then went to DQ.  After that I took him home and I went home because I thought I would be able to take a nap, but I couldn't so I took Bugzy for a walk, and took a longgg bubble bath.  Then NATHAN was  suppose  to call me but he never did so I found him on AOL chitchatting away.  Hmm..let's see...oh ya, after I talked to him, I went over to his house, Only to find the X Box Junkies (Mike, Chad, and Nate) playing away at their game.  So I sat there awhile and annoyed Nate because he was only paying attention to his GAME and not me!  Oh well, you know how guys and their games are, I guess...lol. After that, I went to my grams and spent the night.    As for today...   I'm waiting for Natron to finish getting ready.  We are gonna go eat @ Hardscrabble, and then go fishing, because he is DYING to go, even though I think it is gonna rain! Ooooh well.  I'm in a good mood, ONLY because I don't have to work today!!!!! ((And because I'll be able to spend some time with Nathan, since he IS my husband and all..lol))  Well, I'm gonna go "freshen up", and hopefully Nate will be ready to roll, or I'm leaving, without him!                                                 -:- Courtneyyyyyyyy -:-

      Last night was just PURE fun.                           **i'm kidding.....  Nathan and I got in   ANOTHER   FIGHT!  (Because I didn't want to go to Ottawa's cruise night) --Uhh, hello? I'm a chick not a DUDE...cars are not my thing..not in Ottawa at least! It's funny...when guys are mad, they'll go off on you for like an hour and try and say "I didn't mean anything I said" yeahhhhhh...nice try.  So I don't know what's up with that right now.  Oh well, what can I say, I'm sure it's my fault.  Anyways, I know none of you want to hear about my love life...  !!--!! &gt;&gt;  Haylee, *my lil sister* is leaving on June 25th to go to Georgia for like 3 or 4 weeks...what a bitch!!  If only MISS COURTNEY could get out of this skanky town for a month, must be nice! My aunt says "You can come during christmas"--Well first of all Christmas? I wouldn't get as many presents, I would only be able to come for like 2 weeks, and I'd miss all my family christmas stuff...You can't always have your way I guess.   Tonight I have another reception to go to...which I doubt I'll go-depends on what  HE'S  doing.  I'm at work now, as usual...I'll probably leave @ 12 when Brent gets here.  I work tomorrow, too... 10-5.  How fun.  I'll write more later...or maybe I'll put some PICS up!   Courtney
