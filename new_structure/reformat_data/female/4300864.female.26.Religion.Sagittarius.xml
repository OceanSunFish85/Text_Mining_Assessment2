         dear B,      good God, heaven saves me...   what was just happened..   **   news flash   ** my sweet blue car got hit by a motorbike, didn't do me any harm, but still... replacing the 'right-turn' front light is a must...      the accident happened around 5.30 pm today, i was just slowly driving my car away from the office exit gate, minding my own business, trying to tame the mid-heavy after-hours traffic crossing the road n on my way to my usual daily U-turn... i went on my granny's speed trying to catch up other vehicles to get to the U-turn when suddenly... " BANG!!! "... 2 boys on a motorbike hit my car as they attempted to overtake my car from the outrageous RIGHT side... unbelievable...      well... they n the bike went down instantly after successfully throwing my right front light to the air n landed harshly on the grass pavement...    the stupid boy rushing towards me as i opened my side window n he started yelling the stupidest things i've ever heard my entire live... "hey lady, u supposed to give sign if u're gonna turn right!" and i screamed back, "hey!!! i've signed since i left the exit gate, look its still on! off course u cant see it now coz u've managed to put it there on the grass, u dumb ass! now get ur ass over there (my finger pointing to the other side of the road) lets finish this off, right now!!!"       hmm... what happened next is... at first i put on a good fight and played the grown up mature lady's nice n easy attitude (even offered to take them back to my office clinic to get first aid for their bruises n wounds) and i wrapped it up with 'their registration and his dad's name plus a complete home address + phone number' on my hand as i told him to go to hell... naah!! im too nice... i just told him to go home...       apparently he's under age n dont have a licence yet... geez.. that's just grrreat... what else's new... kids!!!... he's begging to swap the registration with his student ID ** As If!!!** He kept on saying that he's scared the police might catch him on the road without licence n registration... good Lord!!...       people surrounded us... couldn't careless... hell with them... what's on my mind that time was only how i could fix the car right away and how much its gonna cost me... wait til my sister 'the lioness' found out... i'll be hanging up side down from the 101st floor sky craper somewhere in a woop woop land for the rest of my pathetic life watching all the most eligible bachelors i dreamed of remarried for the uncountable times and if im lucky i could be in my normal gravitation mode when i reached the age of 40... that's what's on my mind...       tried to get home ASAP and spit the breakout news to mom and called the boy's Dad right away... talked to the undecisive older sister instead, said dad's not home yet maybe after 8, only a sick sleeping mom at home, and a scared not-home-yet-either boy... temporary dead end...      be nice... be nice... stay calm... u'll be fine... that's whats on my head over n over while eating my instant fried noodle that no longer express its brand name "Delicious Noodle"... FUDGE!!! not only the accident caused me losing my fabulous appetite but do u know how long it takes when u wait for the time to come... Ages!!! 60 minutes of pain and suffer...      finally, 8.04 i went straight to the phone and dialled that number again... the Dad picked it up in 2 rings!! whoaaa... guess he's been expecting me... i was nice, friendly, mature... he behave too... until... SHITake mushroom, man!!!     <span style="c"/></post></Blog>
