       Chapter 1: October Rain   October rains were depressing in Maine, especially to Levi. Even the most cheerful of people, like himself, could not help but feel burdened by the low mist crawling inward from the harbour.  Levi wandered glumly along the roadside, entranced by the whispers of leaves as they where whisked upward to dance above the huge evergreens.  Levi crossed Kennebec Street and turned left onto Androscoggin Road. Shops of all kinds lined the streets of old downtown Boothbay Harbour. The old 50âs diner on Androscoggin and Baxter stood ever vacant, itâ siding and roof peeling from years of intense rain and wind.  The music store, Leviâs favourite place to go, was quiet, as usual. An artist sat quietly, his canvas before him, painting a lighthouse that stood solemn and strong in the distance. Many times the old lighthouse led Levi to the bitter cold shores of the Atlantic. Levi yielded to his urge and strolled towards the shore. He watched the lobster skiffs, their bells ringing eerily as they approached the harbour.   He remembered as a child of five, swimming and joyfully playing in the waters of the Atlantic with his older brother. This was by far his fondest memory of his seaside home in England.  Now, he stood on the other side of what he thought was his endless playground. Levi would come here when he needed time to himself, often finding the cool mist of the ocean a pleasant reminder of the docks in Liverpool. Today, his mind was on more troubling things. Nothing could distract him from what Jenna had said earlier that day.  Then again, nothing he could do would ever change her mind. She had decided. Heâd lost her, and there was nothing he could do.  Levi turned away from the blue-grey waters discouraged. He desperately wanted to be home, but deep inside he dreaded what awaited him. Down the pier he walked, head hanging in sadness. His heart was heavily as he made his way through the damp sand and onto the front steps of the Kaisner familyâs beachfront home.  The red oak door of the large red brick home swung opened widely. Standing there was Leviâs friend, Oswyn Sheraton. Sympathy filled this young manâs eyes as he stared motionless at his Levi. Seconds passed, each one waiting for the other to say something. Levi impatiently pushed his friend aside and threw down his backpack. âWhat the hell do you think youâre doing in my house?â âI wanted to see how you where doing.â Oswyn placed his hand apathetically on Leviâs shoulder. Levi rolled his eyes and clanked up the oak stairs. âWhat makes you think I need to be checked up on?â   "Look. Levi! Please!â Oswyn followed his friend up the stairs and into his loft bedroom. Levi sat on his bed, a pen and a pad of paper in his hand. âIâm fine! Quit following me around!â    âLev. Jenna's... a fickle chick.  I hate to say it, but she's just like my mom. Don't rake yourself over the coals just 'cause the inevitable happened!  I know you really want her, but, brother, I know better. Know what I mean?"  Levi crossed his legs effortlessly and jotted down a few words. "Put me out like a flaming bag of dog shit someone left on her doorstep! Thatâs my only problem!â    Levi was beginning to believe Os was trying to rub the fact Jenna cheated on him in his face. Levi wouldnât put it past him. Os was a scumbag, to say the least. He was the kind of person who would steal the shirt off your back and flaunt it in your face as you shivered in the cold. Then, heâd do you a âfavourâ by giving you your shirt back.    "Take that grin off your face Oswyn, before I sweep the bloody floor with it."  Oswyn paused. He knew better than to push Levi. Heâd learned that hard way, and ended up with a broken nose.  Though Oswyn wouldnât admit to it, he wouldnât dare risk getting in fisticuffs with Levi. Levi was humoured by it. He could beat Oswyn to a bloody pulp. They both knew that.    âYou've got to admit.  You caused it.â Oswyn shrugged with a half smile on his face. "WHAT THE HELL!â A look of intense fear on Osâs face almost made Levi burst out laughing. âI didnât know your sister was a bloody bitch! I wouldnât have touched her if I did!â   âDonât talk about Jenna like that, Levi. Thatâs what caused it! I donât treat my girlfriend like that!â  Levi flung himself off his bed and flew across the room where Oswyn was standing and grabbed him by the throat. It was like he was rubbing the fact he had a girlfriend in his face.    âOh! So you sayâ¦ Going to see her after you leave here?â Oswyn have Levi a frightened nod. âOh dove, you wouldnât want to miss that.â Oswyn nodded again, his face turning red from lack of air. âGet out of here!â Levi flung Osâs limp body out his bedroom door and growled at his friend, âBefore I lose my temper.â Levi bitterly whispered words to anger as he slammed his door shut.  Walking over to his desk, he grabbed the framed and signed picture of Jenna Sheraton and threw in to the ground.  The glass shattered with a crash as the old oak floor.  Getting his baseball bat from the corner his closet, he struck the floor length mirror in anger and frustration.   Frigidly, he watched the shards as they lay; glimmering brightly as golden light burst out from behind a cloud and shone thought the window. He dropped the bat sank to knees amidst the sea of glass slivers.  The glass captivated him and grew increasingly tempting.   Trembling, he took a large piece in his hand; its caress was like a razor.  Running it against his wrist, he felt the glass slice deeply into his skin.   Levi watched indifferently as blood trickled warmly down his arm, dribbled, and hit the ground in front of him.  Hesitantly, he etched the letter "P" into his wrist.  Clenching though the intents pain, Levi continued brushing the glass against his skin, until at last, the word "Pain" was legible.  "Pain. That is my life.  That is my future.  It will be my death."  * * * * * * * * *  The lock clicked as Gracie Cleeton shoved the key into it.  She was exhausted from a hard day at school, followed by a horrid day at her work, the gas station down the road. She hated working there. It was hard work for little money. Still, at least she was making something. Grace shouldered her backpack and sighed contentedly. Her body was sore from lifting boxes and stocking shelves.  Gracie stared into the floor to ceiling mirror and smiled. She looked good in her new skirt, matching "Omen" T-shirt, and purple fishnet stockings.  She bent down and untied her knee-high leather boots, and hummed the familiar song blasting from her portable CD player. âJob isnât all that bad if I can buy this stuff!â   Wearily she turned the doorknob on opened her bedroom door. She was shocked to find her boyfriend sitting on her bed waiting for her. He frequently did this kind of thing to surprise her. He knew exactly what to do. Every word to say. Every place to go. He was the perfect boyfriend.   "Oh Grace. You look,â He said, staring at her. Grace giggled and stuck her tongue out. "Yeah Jason... I know. I look hotter that earth's core..." He grinned shrewdly. "Not what I was thinking, but I guess you could say that."   Gracie walked over to her nightstand and began to take off her jewellery. âHow was your day?â Jason quickly slid up behind her and hugged her waist tightly. âVery well, thank you,â Jason smiled broadly. âBut I know a way you could make it betterâ¦â Grace gazed at his reflection in horror as he slithered his hands down the sides of her skirt.    "You know... I could really get to know you better if you'd let me touch you."  "Jason! Stop it!"  Gracie giggled playfully. He leaned over her shoulder and attempted to kiss her. She pulled away in disgust.    âJasonâ¦ Stop.â whispered her voice became tense and frightened. She spun around and yanked his hands from her skirt. "Oh, come on Grace! Loosen up. You love me don't you?" Jason smiled with a half smile that melted Grace's heart. "Of course I do Jay." She said pulling him in close to her and pressing her hear against his chest. "I'm not ready yet, that's all."    Jason gripped her shoulders tightly and shook her angrily. "How can you not be ready yet! It's been six months. We havenât done so much as KISS!" âI donât want you to kiss me! I told you twice before. Only holding hands and hugging! How hard is that to understand!â He struck her violently across the face. âVeryâ¦â Gracie stared back at Jason, stunned. Her cheek throbbed painfully; her heart seemed to want to jump out of her chest.    "Jas... Jason please..." She backed up towards her bed. âGrace! Donât give me that crap! Iâve had it with you!â âWhat did I do, Jay?â She looked him in the eye and whimpered. He laughed sinisterly. âItâs what you didnât do thatâs the problem!â   Tears welled up in her eyes. âJason. I told you. Iâm not ready. I made it very clear to you, did I not?â Jason ignored her words. âIf you really loved me, youâd do what I say. I guess you donât love me!â Grace was hurt. Jason was her life. Her world revolved around him. Was he breaking up with her?   âI do love youâ¦ I just canât. I just want to wait a little longer.â "No, Grace! I've waited far too long." Jason pulled out a knife from his pocket pushed her onto her back.  âJason! Please!â He slashed at her clothes as she tried franticly to kick him away.   He was going to rape her. Gracie began to sob, realising her efforts to get away were useless against him. âJasonâ¦ Donât do thisâ¦ Please! Iâm begging you!â Grace received a hard blow to the jaw.    * * * * * * * * *  Grace was jolted awake by the crashing of the screen door. She was alone in her bed. She squinted at the clock on the nightstand to see the time. It was 3:30 AM. She looked around the room shaken. She saw nothing.    Grace found herself half believing it was a dream. Cold sweat dripped down her forehead. Her hands were clammy. It had been a horrible dream. She sighed, exhausted, and closed her eyes. It had felt so real. âWhyâd I dream thatâd heâd do that to me?â She took a deep breath and relaxed. âGo to the bathroom, take a shower. Calm yourself down.â She told herself as she rolled over.    The covers on the opposite side of the bed matted and twisted. Her stomach turned. She shook in horror as she ran her slender fingers along her face. Her chin was swollen and sore. Beneath her lip was a trail of dried blood. Jason had raped her. It wasnât a dream.   She broke down. In agony, she got up off the bed and crawled to the bathroom. She locked the door behind her. She shook and sobbed as she ran her hand crossed a large surface gash on her chest. Graceâs head spun, her body ached. She felt as though she was going to be sick. A note was taped to the mirror. She weakly pealed the tape off. It was from Jay.  I'll see you tomorrow Grace. Love you.     						   Jay Jay 	 She crawled from the bathroom door to the shower and turned the water on. Like an animal she crawled onto the shower. She shook with anger and fear. Would he do it again? What if she was pregnant? Questions flooded her mind. She laid face down on the ashen marble shower floor. The water beads hit her back soothingly.  "I am alone."	  * * * * * * * * *  Levi woke to the sound of his alarm clock. His head pounded, his eyes blurred from sleep. He sat up, and looked around the room. He had fallen asleep on the floor.  "Levi? Are ya awake yet?" His mother called in her usual thick scouse. "Yeah. I'm up."  "Come down and eat, love."    Quickly, Levi swept up the broken glass and slid his half-empty bottle of whisky beneath his bed. Levi dug sleepily thought his dresser Levi grabbed a T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a sweatshirt. Ripping off his T-shirt, he brushed his hand against the collar and cringed.  He told himself heâd have to be strong if he was going to last the day. He groaned lazily as unbuttoned his pants and slipped on the new pair. He wanted to be left alone. Heâd have to face his family. He had no idea how.   Stumbling numbly downstairs to the kitchen, he ran into his eight-year-old brother, Asher. At the table sat Jonathan, five, Paul, four, and the littlest, the drooling two year old, Samuel. A heaping pile of pancakes and bacon was placed at each chair.  "How did you sleep?"  His father asked in his deep northern English. Silence filled the room.   "Fine..." Levi riposted, adding a persuasive smile. "Well, you better eat young man.  Youâve gotta leave in a few.  I don't wantâs yer late for school."  Mrs. Kaisner looked tired. Seven months pregnant with twins, it was to be expected.   âNo problem Mum.â Levi took a few bites and stood up, kissed his mother on the cheek and patted her bulging stomach. âSee you later, Levi.â His mother smiled.  Relieved, Levi pulled on his shoes and slinging his backpack on, he called to his mother and father. "I better go.  I'm not that hungry.  Thanks Mum.  I'll be late getting home tonight. 5:00."  "All right Levi. See you later."    Chapter 2: House of Hope   Unshaven and tired, Levi stumbled into the corridor of his High school. His head was pounding, his movements inhibited by sleepiness. His wrist was stiff and sore from the cuts. It felt as if his hand was encased in cement. The people around him seemed to be moving in languidly. Noisy lockers banged and creaked as they where open and shut. Suddenly, Levi felt himself bump into something. Books and papers fell to the ground in a disorderly heap.   "Oh... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to run into you. Please forgive me!"  Levi smiled mockingly and picked up the girl's things. Her face flushed as her eye met his. "No. It's all right. I swear."  Levi looked the girl over. He remembered her from somewhere. From where, he had no idea.  "Oh thank you."  The girl grunted taking her books. Levi extended his hand. She looked at it, and hesitantly shook it.  "Grace..." She sighed. "Levi." "I know. We have English together."  "Donât remember you.â Levi gritted his teeth.  Grace's eyes shot to his, as if she was hurt by his words, or lack there of.    "Yes... It's been a while. Vacation." Gracie she lied as a sombre tear rolled down her cheek.  An uncomfortable silence blanked them. "Well. We better get to class.  See you later.â  Levi sighed as he turned to walk away. Jenna suddenly appeared from behind a cluster of lockers. She was alone. Levi felt his heart skip a beat.  She looked beautiful. She stood in front of him, suggestively batting her eyelids.    âOh. Hello Mr. Kaisner. How are you today?â Jenna words sent a chill though Leviâs body, making him speechless. âIâmâ¦ Iâm alright.â âWellâ¦ How right?â Levi took a deep breath. âWell enough. Better before you left me.â  âOh, Leviâ¦ I didnât LEAVE you.â Leviâs face became heated with anger. âWhat do you mean you didnât leave me! What about Ash Wednesday! Jason Edwards! What about them?â Ash Wednesday and Jason Edwards were two of the most popular people in the school.  Many times, Levi had seen Jenna hand in hand with one or the other, and sometimes, both at the same time.  âOh, that was just a fling.â âJenna! Iâm not going to sit around waiting for you. If you want me, then have me, but no other. I could and would give you anything you wanted. Stop mucking around and choose.â Jenna giggled evilly. âOh Levi! I love it when you talk like that. Iâll have to think about it.  Weigh the variables. Iâll get back to you baby.â Jenna leaned over and kissed Levi on the cheek, then walked away to join her friends.  Leviâs world spun as he realised what she had just done. Maybe he WOULD get Jenna back. Maybe she still wanted him. He may just win the fight.  * * * * * * * * *  Grace walked away feeling worse than she had when she walked into the busy foyer of the school.  She was hurt by the rigour in Leviâs voice. He didnât know her; he didnât care to.  Grace remembered his first day in the school system. It was ninth grade. He was fifteen.  He was the most handsome guy Grace had ever seen. His British accent was most attractive.  The sound of it used to make Grace giggle.   Though she never publicly admitted it, Grace had a crush on him from the day they met.  His wit and intelligence had once charmed her. Obviously, heâd changed. He was rude and inconsiderate. Hate bubbled up in her as Grace though about him.  âHow could I have EVER had a crush on such an arrogant idiot!â She growled to herself. âThat moron. Frigginâ jerk.â    In the corner of her eye, she spotted Jason. He was relaxed, chatting with his buddies. The conversation probably had something to do with her. Graceâs anger quickly morphed into horror.  What was he saying? âGrace!â Jason lunged and wrapped his arms around her. He made it seem as if it was a loving embrace. In all reality, he was squeezing the life out of her. She could only guess that this was Jason way of a silent warning to her. She gave him a cold eye.   âJasonâ¦â His expression turned from happiness to anger. âWhy didnât you come to my house this morning?â Grace shook. She had to be careful with her words. âI was busy.â Jason squeezed harder. âMake sure you arenât busy next time, alright?â âOfâ¦ Of course Jason. Iâmâ¦ sorry.â Jason pushed her away and walked off. Grace turned to watch him and his friends turn the corner. She breathed a sigh of relief. Images of the night before flashed though her mind. The pain, both physical and metal, was fresh in her memory. Her skin crawled, chilling her to the bone. Her cheek throbbed. Her throat was dry.    She hugged her books to her chest. Pain surged though her body. Everything was sore. She took a step forward, then another step. Tears welled up in her eyes. The pain overwhelmed her, so much so that she wanted to die. She shook her head and took a deep breath. âTake in one at a time.â She said to herself. âTake it easy.â As she stepped into her law classroom, her law teacher, Ms. Matheson, stopped her. âHey Grace. How are you?â âFine. Yourself?â âWell. I havenât seen you in a while. Is everything alright?â Grace didnât quite know what to say. âIâll be fineâ¦â  âI talked to your father yesterday.â Grace rolled her eyes. âLemmy guess. Heâs worried about meâ¦â  Ms. Matheson put her hand on Graceâs shoulder. âWeâre all worried Grace. Your grades are starting to drop. It seems all you ever want to do is play the drums...andâ Grace gave her a hard look and cut her off. âWhatâs wrong with that?â   âNothing.â Ms. Matheson shrugged. âWe just want you to know that we care about you. If you ever need to talk, any teacher here would be happy to help.â âWhat makes you think Iâd want to talk to my fatherâs friends?â Ms. Matheson made a sour face.   âWhatâs wrong Grace.  Really. You can trust me.â Grace stared coldly into her teacherâs grey eyes. She could hardly believe what she was hearing. She could TRUST her? âLook. Iâm not telling you anything. If I did, youâd go running to my father, and everything would be ruined. Thanks for the offer, but talking to you would just make it worse.â  * * * * * * * *  Leviâs day went by unusually quick. The day was drawing to a close, and Levi was getting anxious. He just wanted to go home and wait for a sign from Jenna. Levi softly sang to himself as he walked though the halls.  He strolled into his fifth period class, English. There, in the far back seat, was Grace, reading a book. Levi groaned. He knew full well that she was going to be there, yet he didnât believe heâd really have to deal with her.   âOkay guys.â Mr. Klein said, tapping his fingers on his desk. The teacher caught Leviâs eye. He smiled as he spoke. Levi reached into his bag and grabbed his notebook and a pencil. âWeâre going to be doing a drama and arts presentation this semester. You may do as you wish, but you will be expected to present to the class.  As Levi began to jot down ideas. Heâd probably want you write a song and play it. Mr. Klein interrupted him. "Levi. I assume youâll be working alone.â Levi smiled. Mr. Klein knew his style all too well. âYeah, I guess.â   Levi looked around the room as he jotted down ideas for a new song. Before he knew it, Levi heard the final bell ring. Levi was easily lost in his mind when he was writing.  Levi heaped his papers together and grabbed his bag from next to him. He classmates anxiously thundered out of the classroom and trudged to their lockers. Levi heard a voice speak to him. âAre you still coming to youth meeting tonight?" A pang of annoyance went though Levi's body. He had forgotten that he promised Mr. Klein that he would come. "Errâ¦ ohâ¦ yeah."  "Great! See you there!"   "Why'd I have to agree to go to that stupid church meeting?" Levi cursed as he slammed his locker closed.  How dumb was he to think that sitting in a cramped room full of Christianity crazed teens, looking down at him for being the guy he was... having them try to change him... Would be entertaining? "Klein better give me extra credit for this..." Levi groan, giving into the fact that he had no choice but to go.  * * * * * * * * * *  "Welcome everyone to the House of Hope, especially our visitors." Mr. Klein winked doltishly at Levi, sitting, arms folded, in the far back corner of the claustrophobic room.  Levi scanned the room for a familiar face, but none was to be found. "I'm not going too long with preaching tonight."  Mr. Klein smiled at his audience. Everyone quickly closed his or her bible. They looked like robots.  "I'd rather just mingle tonight. Tell stories of salvation."  Levi sighed, relived.  The door creaked open slowly. There, standing in the doorway was Grace Cleeton and Jason Edwards, holding hands. "Oh." Mr. Klein looked up from his notes. "You're just in time!" Levi was shocked to see her here, but even more to see Jason Edwards. He was Jennaâs boyfriendâ¦ What was he doing holding hands with Gracie?  Grace blushed and averted her eyes as she saw Levi staring at her, wonderingly. Klein droned on... his voice was just white noise. Levi watched Grace as she listened intently, her hand on Jasonâs lap. Disgust overwhelmed Leviâs body.  Time past slowly. Levi swore it had been an hour... It was five minutesâ¦ Finally, an hourâ¦ âSo... I'm just going to play some nice music, set out some muchies, and we can all chat." Klein said, concluding his "preaching."   A young man coming up to Levi and offered his hand. "Riordan. I became a born again Christian three months ago." "Levi. Atheist." Levi replied. The young man laughed. "Really? You should meet my sister." The man suggested, waving his hand.  Grace came forward meekly, her hands clasped together. "Hello again Levi." Grace smiled sweetly. Grace turned to her brother. "He's in Dadâs English class." Oh! That's cool..." Riordan grinned as he slipped away from the conversation and into another.  "Dadâs?â âYeahâ¦ Klein is our stepfather.â Levi gulped. âAnd you're Christian, right?" Levi questioned Grace. Grace raised her eyebrow, humoured by his inquiry.  "Oh noâ¦ I'm notâ¦ Everything but Christianâ¦ I still do enjoy coming to chat with my brother's friends." Jason Edwards, a cup of apple juice in his hand, walked up behind her. "This is Jason. My boyfriend." Levi extended a hand. Jason examined it carefully and shook it tenaciously.  Levi felt the heat of jealously on his face. How dare he take Jenna away and then be with someone else? "I better go. I need to get home." He lied.   Slipping out the door and down the hallway, Levi sighed, thankful that ordeal was over. "Finally."  Levi reached deeply into his pocket and pulled out a razor blade. Walked a few more paces and out into the lobby. All was quiet. He looked around, his heart beating a mile a minute. He shook a little, wondering why he wanted to do this to himself. "In the name of Lucifer." He said as he slid the blade acrossed his skin. He stood at the end of the large corridor, shocked at his words. "Lucifer..."  * * * * * * * * *  Grace turned to watch as Levi left the room. "What do you think you are doing Grace?" Jason hissed, grabbing her arm. "I don't want you talking to guys like that. Don't make me tell you again." "I'm sorry Jason." Grace whispered, holding back the tears. "You better be." Jason tightened his grip on her arm. "Don't let me see it happen again."   "Grace. Jason." Riordan said, putting his hand on their shoulders. He looked down at Grace's arm, red from Jason's unmerciful grip.  "How are you?" His questing eyes met Grace's. It was as if he was telling her âIs he doing that to you?â   "We're great!" Jason cooed, holding Grace close to his chest. There was no warmth in his embrace. "Never been better." Jason planted an unconvincing kiss on her cheek. It was still sore from when he slapped her across the face. Grace tried to hide her ache by smiling.    "You sure? You know, I'm here for you guys if you need help." Riordan looked as if he was speaking only to her.  "Why on EARTH would you think we need help Riory?" Grace lashed at him. Her brother was taken back. "Alright." Her brother looked her over tragically. "I need to go home Jay..." "Fine." Jason groaned. âIâll be home in about an hour, Grace.â Jason pulled her towards the door.   * * * * * * * *  Gracie sank to her bedroom floor, exhausted.  Digging beneath her bed, she pulled out a ziplock bag full of pot. âAhaâ¦ here we goâ¦â She said as she lit one and held it delicately between her pointer finger and thumb. As she brought it up to her full lips, she laughed. âLeviâ¦ A cool guy.â Inhaleâ¦ exhaleâ¦ inhaleâ¦ exhaleâ¦ âMan did I need thisâ¦â   She reached for her drumsticks, which were sitting on her nightstand and walked into the living room, flipping them about cleverly. The full drum kit sheâd gotten for her sixteenth birthday sat appealingly in the corner of the room. She walked over and sat down at the drum kit. She puffed continuously at her reefer as she banged away. Her talent was incredible, as if she was able to play without even thinking.  Now all she needed was someone to play with. 	   Chapter 3: Brotherly Advice   Grace sat at home behind her drum kit. Sheâd just gotten up from a restless sleep, and she was ready for a smoke, when Riordan flung open his bedroom door. 	âHey kid. Howâs the new song coming along?â âWell enough, I guess. A lot of work left.â She said, trying to hide her disappointment.  She drummed away skilfully. Riordan sang to the beat as he walked into the kitchen, opened the maple cupboards, and then closed them.   âYou look tiredâ¦you hungry Grace?â Grace looked up at him but continued playing. âIâm a little hungry. Did you want me to make you something Riory?â  She put the drumsticks down and stood up. âOh no, I was going to make YOU something! Mom and Dad are at Pastor Danâs house for dinner.â   âYou really donât need to do that.â Grace stopped drumming and gave her brother a strange look. âWhy not? I havenât hung out with you in a whileâ¦ sibling bonding time. Mom and Dad arenât coming home for a while. We can just chillâ¦ Chilli! Yesâ¦ Chilli. Iâm makingâ chilli baby! Youâre going to have to make the cornbreadâ¦ I donât feel like mush tonight.â  Grace laughed as she older brother shot around the kitchen frantically looking for âThe pot with the no stick stuff on it.â She walked over to the stereo and picked her favourite radio station. Walking back into the kitchen, she saw Riordan look over his shoulder as he was chopping onions. Bobbing up and down to the music, he sang mawkishly. Grace could do nothing but laugh hysterically at her brotherâs out of key lamentations.   âCome on, you know thatâs going to mess up your voice.â âYes, but I donât sing anymore since the band split.â Grace opened the cupboard and grabbed a box of ez-cornbread mix. As she began to make the mix into dough, her brother moved his vegetables and cutting board over to the table where Grace was working. âI knowâ¦ we need to find someone else, but I donât know anyone who can play guitar or bass.â Riordan smiled. âJust pray. Weâll find who we need.â  âHow have you and Jason been doing?â Grace froze. She looked upâ¦ hesitated... âFine. Why do you ask?â âHe seems to be a bit overbearingâ¦ Just wondering how he was treating youâ¦â Riordan as waiting for an answer. He knew. She didnât want to look up and him. She knew sheâd break into tears. âIâll be alright.â Grace said kneading the dough. A pause.   âIs there something wrong Grace?â âHis a bit of a rough neck, thatâs all.â Grace shrugged and tried to cover her feelings with a smile. âHow so?â Grace didnât know how to react. âHeâs demandingâ¦ He expects a lot from me. Question for you Riory. Are you ever going to stop asking?â âWell, probably not. I donât wanna horn in where I donât belong. I just care about you, Grace. I know itâs hard to believe right now, but I really do care. I know what itâs like. SAD is a hard thing. Remember. I have it too. Youâre not alone.â  âYeah? You think so?â Grace walked around the table setting plates down, as well as a salad and cups. âI didnât mean it like that Grace.â  Riordan came up behind her and placed his hand on her shoulder. âGod loves you.â âI know, youâve told me. So does Jason. No need to worry.â  âI am worried Grace. Iâve seen the way he looks at you. I see no love in his eyes. Iâm sure youâve noticed it too.â Grace turned around. She felt as if she wanted to smack him. His eyes were caring. Understanding. They didnât soften her heart, but made her more angry. She silently sat down at the table and waited for him to take his place.  Riory took his seat. Worry racked his eyes. âDid you have a fight or something?â âNo.â  âAre you angry with him?â  âNoâ¦â â What is he doing to youâ¦? What is he saying? Graceâ¦ I need you to tell me exactly what heâs doing.â He reached acrossed the table at grabbed her hand. âRiory! Please! I donât wanna talk about it.â   âIf heâs hurting you, you need to tell me.â She looked up and stared into his blue eyes. âPiss off! What can you do anyway?!â   * * * * * * * *  âErrâ¦ BEN! Leviâs home!â Yelled Asher and Jonathan, who were hitting Samuel over the head with a pillow, must to his disliking. (He made that very clear by screaming incessantly.) Levi jogged up the stairs and into his bedroom. Behind him, Ben came into his bedroom and plopped down onto his bed.  âHey Levâ¦ How was church?â Ben inquired. âHell.â Levi laughed. âCheekyâ¦â Ben said, his brutish British accent ringing. Levi returned. âOh, but of course!â Levi had been working on his American accent. A scouse accent in southern Maine was rather obvious, and drew far too much attention for Leviâs liking. Ever since his family had moved to the United States from Liverpool, Levi had tried to change to fit in. His home was like another worldâ¦ he could be somewhat like himself there.  Besides Oswyn, Ben was Leviâs only friend. He and Ben had been close from the day Levi was born.  When their mother died, their dependence on each other grew ever more. For several years, it had been just Ben, Levi, and their father. Though Levi didnât remember what his mother was like, Levi was horrified when he found his father was engaged. Levi and his brother, subconsciously, treated their stepmother as if she wasnât there. Even more so after Ash and Johnny were born.   Just then, Oswyn walked in the door. Oswyn, for some odd reason, had no problem walking into their house unannounced. It irritated Levi a little, but he never said anything about it. Os was smiling, caring three brown paper bags in his arms.   âGot some treats from my dealer last night. Should cheer you up.â âImported whisky from London, joints, a bottle of ecstasy, and a dozen shots of heroine? Howâd the HELLâD you score THIS?â Levi took a lighter out of his pocket and lit the small joint between his thumb and point finger, then a second one that Oswyn was holding out to him. Then, he passed the lighter to his brother. Blue-green smoke puffed upward as they inhaled and exhaled.   âAhâ¦ No problem, really. I just know the right people.â Levi sarcastically shook his head in disgust. âYou mean, youâve fucked the right people.â Ben chuckled. Oswyn made a funny face and laughed. âThat tooâ¦â âMy parents are out for the nightâ¦â Oswyn loosened the cap of his whisky and took a chug. He swallowed hard and chuckled.  âI know some girls who are looking to get laid.â  Levi chuckled. Oswyn looked at Levi. âOf course! Would Ben could come too!â Levi laughed and took a swig of his own whisky. The liquid went down soothingly. Oswyn could always tell what he was thinking.  Ben got up and left the room. âIâll be right back. Iâve gotta pee.â  âYeah.â Levi chuckled to his brother. He reached to his right and ran his callused fingertips up and down the body of his twelve-string Rickenbacker. The face of the body was a fire pattern; the neck was done in a zigzag pattern. Its strings were worn from hours upon hours of use as was the pick guard; an ebony pearl. This guitar was his life. The one thing he treasured most. He lifted the guitar from its stand and plucked away, using the scribbles on his paper as a kind of a guide. He was writing yet another song.  Oswyn took the chair that was pushed it at Leviâs desk and straddled it leisurely. "Iâm sure I could find you two a couple galls for tonight. Plenty of girls who are looking to make a bit of money.â Levi, inside, was appalled by this. He didnât really want to take drugs and have sex with people he didnât know. Levi wasnât like that normally, but Os opened a new world up to him. He loved the rush of using drugs and drinking. It wasnât really the things that made the hair on his arms stand up. It was the fact that his parents would kill him that made him so exhilarated. Now that he had Os, he wasnât just going to give up.   âI could probably even get Jenna for you.â Levi smiled. Jennaâ¦ Os could get him Jenna! It was brilliant! âOh yeah! Sure Osy, use my phone!â Levi laughed as Oswyn, without previous permission, picked up his receiver. His friend gave him a silly grin and chuckled. âGunna call Astrid. Sheâs goodâ¦ Veryâ¦ goâ¦good. Iâm sure some of her friends need to buy a new CD or something.â  Levi set the guitar down and shimmied to the window. He stood in his bedroom window and looked down at Asher and Jonathan playing in the park acrossed the street. He gazed fondly around his room, looking over the dozens of guitars on stands. Levi was proud of his guitar collection, featuring several original Rickenbackers, a six-string and a twelve-string blondie, identical model and year as Lennon and Harrisonâs.  His widely coveted sunburst Hofner bass, two of his Gretsches, and a Hofner President were positioned in a circle, ready for the time warranted him to play a switch off.   Ben walked back into the room and came over to Levi side and poked his ribs. A look of disappointment came on to Leviâs face. âWaitâ¦you had a date.â Ben laughed. âIndeedâ¦ I did...âWhatâs the plan? A night on the town?â Levi shook his head. âMore like, a night on Tiffany.â   As their laughing subsided, Levi rolled up his sleeves and gripped firmly in his hands his classical guitar. The  guitar was designed and created by his grandfather, Johnny Kaisner.  Levi could distinctly remember him playing the guitar and singing wholeheartedly in Irish accent.  The words to Grandpa Johnnyâs favourite song rang melodiously in his mind. âLet us play, love. â He nodded two his brother to take up a second guitar.   Drab grey skies âave eard the cries âave learnt the hymns Of ail kith Thy mortal men Shall never win The Crown and Jewel of Dublin  So drink to the feeble nâ cry for her child The child of mar and bloody moil Dear Lisa she rises  Sheâs risenâ ân fallen The mortal men Shall never win The Crown and Jewel of Dublin  Curse the wicked  God bless the emerald Isle Cry out for the dying Rejoice for the dead For their mortal men Shall never win The Crown and Jewel of Dublin  Levi looked up at his brother, who was now standing next to him. Oswyn was in the doorway, making a funny face.  He brought his joint up to his mouth and made a cooing sound. âOh, how sweet. Looks like a movie reel from the Kaisner family reunion. Now that thatâs over, Jenna would like to speak to Mr. L. Kaisner.â Oswyn passed the phone to Levi. He hesitantly pulled the receiver to his ear.   âHey Levâ¦ How are you tonight?â Jenna whispered alluringly. âVery wellâ¦Now.â âOh reallyâ¦â âIndeedâ¦ Soâ¦ You rangâ¦ Did you need something?â âI was wondering if you could come overâ¦ Os has a date with my girlsâ¦and the parents are gone for the weekend.â Levi gulped ecstatically. âIâll be there.â Levi grinned. âSee you thenâ¦ Mr. Kaisnerâ¦â She hung up.    * * * * * * * *  âHello Levyâ¦â Jenna was standing in her doorway. She was wearing a risquÃ© pare of pyjamas, bright red velvet with white and blue gems around the seams. The top, a tight spaghetti strap, called attention to her tight stomach and large âtracks of landâ as the guys called them. Her blond hair was in a messy bun, held together with red chopsticks. She looked wonderful.  âOkay Jenna. Where are they?â Os grinned to his sister. âKelly, Astrid, Sarah, and Brittany, Jennifer, and Isis. All in here.â Ben chuckled and pushed Jenna out of the doorway. Oswyn followed him. âWowâ¦ Jenna. You look great.â Levi stood, staring at her. âCome in.â Jenna smiled, acting as if she didnât even hear the compliment. The room was filled with candles. There were two girls sitting on two of the couches, and one on a third couch. A table with a bottle of wine sat in the centre of the room. âDrink?â Jenna said, lifting a crystal wineglass in the air. âYes, please.â Levi grinned.   Elegantly, she poured the golden liquid into the three glasses, and sat down on the love seat. Levi slipped off his shoes and sat down between Jenna and a second girl, who introduced herself as Isis. Isis was wearing an identical par of pyjamas to Jennaâs, but they where blue with red and white gems. Her red hair was in chopsticks, in the same messy bun.  Levi took a glass and examined the wine in his hand, swishing it around in his glass. He sniffed it and nodded. She had made a good choice. Jenna smiled and batted her long eyelashes.  Each girl entwined their arms with his and took a sip of their wine. Levi followed. âVery good choice.â Levi took another sip. âWell thenâ¦ Youâll have to reward us.â Levi stopped and looked up a Jenna, then Isis. He couldnât believe what he just heard.   âHmmâ¦ Well.â He sighed nonchalantly. âHow would you like me to reward you, ladies?â Jenna looked deeply into his eyes; her gaze was almost more intoxicating than his drink.  Isis giggled and blew in his ear. Jenna set her glass down on the lamp stand next to the couch. They both stood up and took each otherâs hands. Levi leaned in and kissed her lips; full and rose-coloured. She pulled away and smiled sweetly. The second girl wrapped her arms around him. Jenna motioned for him to follow her.   * * * * * * * *  âLevi. Jenna is on the ringy-dingy for you!â Levi, startled, pulled the needle of heroine he had stuck in his hand and picked up the phone. Samuelâs cries (He needed a nappy change no doubt.) drowned out Jennaâs voice. Levi pressed the phone closer to his ear and lit a joint.  âHello Jenna.â âHey babyâ¦ You want to go out tonight?â Levi took a razor and slashed his arm. âSure. When?â Deeperâ¦ Deeperâ¦ âWhenever you can pick me up. More time we have the more we can doâ¦â Again he cutâ¦ Deeper than ever before. âOhâ¦ Wellâ¦ If weâre going somewhereâ¦ wear something dressyâ¦about in fifteen minutes?â âSee you then, Levyâ¦â Levi hung up the phone, and noticed that there was a large pool of blood on the hardwood floor. A droplet of blood fell from his arm and landed in the pool, causing a ripple.   âShit.â Levi swore under his breath. He grabbed a hand towel from the hamper and soaked up the blood. Then he took the cloth, half soaked with blood, and knotted it around his arm to slow the bleeding.  The last thing he wanted to do is bleed on the baby. Heâd probably get marks off for that. Levi took two needles that where sitting on the table and stuck them into his ankles. He injected the liquid then pulled them out and threw them away as if it was a routine thing.   He opened his closet door and dug through it. He chose a black suite with a deep red shirt and tie; He was planing on taking her to a fancy restaurant tonight.  He grabbed a role of gauze and walked over to his mirror. He watched himself wrap the gauze tightly around his cuts.   âIâve gotta do SOMETHING with my hair.â He though to himself as he gingerly slipped on his pants and shirt. He quickly but neatly tied his necktie; put on his socks and shoes. Bending over, he got his bottle of hair gel from under his bed and globbed it into his hair to spike it. It was being good today.   âHey Ben!â Levi called as he raced down the stairs. âWooah! Lookinâ cute sailor! You clean up well.â Levi roared with laughter as he playfully punched Ben in the stomach. Ben snatched the joint from his mouth and took a puff of it.  âGot a date!â Levi smiled. âJenna?â Ben said, lifting an eyebrow. âIndeed.â âOh! Go Levi! Think youâre going to get lucky tonight?â Ben whispered. Levi scanned the room for his parents or a sibling who would squeal on him. âAlready haveâ¦â Ben looked as if he had just seen a ghost. âSHITâ¦ Youâre kiddingâ¦â Levi grinned and shook his head. âLast night. Jenna and Isis, both.â âYou lucky bastard!â Ben yelped, punching him softly in the shoulder.   âLads!â Their mother called from the kitchen. âWatch yer language. I donât want lilâ Ash, Jonny, and Paulo pickinâ that vile stuff up!â âSorry Mum.â Ben called, rolling his eyes to make Levi laugh. âLook. I gotta go. Can I use your car?â âSure. Be careful with her.â Ben laughed as he handing the keys over.   * * * * * * * *  âThis is beautiful.â Jenna beamed. The restaurant was upscale. Their table, the dead centre of restaurant, was next to a large fountain with multicolour lights beneath the water, giving the area an iridescent touch.   Levi looked a crossed the table at stared at Jenna, who was gazing into the crystalline waters of the fountain. She was radiant. Her slimming black dress had a revealing v-neck. Around her delicate neck was a large ruby, surrounded with sapphires. She wore a gold ring, bracelet, and earrings with the same jewels. Ironically, his birthstone was the ruby, and hers, the sapphire.   âThank you so much Levi.â âMy pleasure.â He said, taking her in his. She took a little of what was left of their dinner; a large Caesar salad. âVery good.â âGood to hear.â He nodded, taking the last bite.   âWe better go.â Jenna said gulping down the last bit of his water. âWaitâ¦ Why couldnât we fool around a bitâ¦ tonight?â Levi asked slyly, I know, Iâve got work tonightâ¦â  He looked down at his shoes. âBut it could wait.â   Jenna appeared as if she was pondering the idea. âI guess we couldâ¦ Nobodyâs homeâ¦â âCheque please.â Levi said, waving down a waiter. âSo anxious!â âNaturally.â   The cheque came quickly, and he handed the waiter his bankcard. âThank you Sir, Madame.â The waiter bowed. Levi stood and helped Jenna out of her chair. Leviâs hand on Jennaâs shoulder, they walked out the door and to the car. Tonight would be another good night.   Chapter 4: On the Edge    Levi was beat from the last night. He grinned to himself and proudly chuckled as he took his history book out his locker. Normally, heâd be complaining in anguish. It was a Monday. He had always hated Mondays. Even the fact that he had to work tonight did even phase him. He didnât even have to worry about the doll tonight! It was Graceâs turn.  He spotted Jenna, beautiful as ever, at the end of the corridor. He picked up his books and jogged toward her. He was dismayed to find Jason Edwards hanging off her. He felt his face turn red with anger. How COULD she! How DARE sheâ¦   âWhat the HELL do you think youâre doing?â Jenna yelled at Jason. âWhat?â Jasonâs face went red with furry. âI just wanted to get laid while Levi was nailing some other chick.â Leviâs mouth went dry; His hands where numb. He was half ready to laugh at Jason, but he also realised Jenna was ruining his reputation with her words. He was watching them, and half looking for a possible escape. âYouâ¦ You whore!â Jason whispered in disgust. He turned around and walked into the menâs room.  Levi stood with Jenna, watching Jason as he ran off. Jenna smiled an innocent grin at Levi, making him laugh. That smile would always get to him.   âWow.â Levi chuckled, hugging Jenna tightly to his chest. âOh, he was just a fling. Donât worry about him.   * * * * * * * * *  Tears welled up in Graceâs eyes as she saw Jason and Jenna Sheraton together. She knew it all along; she was a temporary fix. Just long enough for Jenna to come crawling back to him. How could she be so naive about it?  How could she think that he really loved her? Did he pretend because he thought sheâd be easy? She stood dumbfounded as questions flooded her mind. Levi jogged past her, a wide smile on his face. He walked up to Jenna, causing an angry exchange of word between Jenna and Jason.  âLeviâs girlfriend no doubt.â Grace said to herself. Jennaâs witch-like cackle drifted toward her.  She heard Jason call her a whore as he backed away and strutted into the boyâs bathroom. She took this opportunity to walk past them, trying to deceive Levi into believing she didnât even notice them.   âHey Grace!â Jenna laughed as he finished locking lips with Levi. âPiss off.â She said, ignoring all her words.  She stopped just outside the washrooms, waiting to she what had happened. The minutes passed. She wasnât about to go into the bathroom just to find out what had happened.   âScrew this!â She cried out. âI donât have time for this.â She walked back to her locker and grabbed her things. Her last class was an hour ago, and she wanted a smoke badly. She hadnât had one in two daysâ¦ She was about ready to explode.  She sighed and flung the doors of the school exit open, and stepped out onto the rain-soaked stairs. It was poring rain, the raindrops as big as quarters. The usual November weather in Maine. The buckles on her army boots made a clinking sound each time she stepped.   Her long black hair was soaked by the time she got home. It was plastered to her face and chest. She unlocked the front door and threw down her backpack. Taking a few more passes, she opened a closet door and pulled out a black bag. She sang as she opened the bag, revealing a set of gemmed drum sticks. She placed them on her drum stool and sighed. She walked around the room, anxiously lighting candles and sticks of incense. She disappeared into her bedroom, coming back into the room a few minutes later dressed in her favourite outfit. In her hand was with a bottle of pills as a bag of pot. She took a deep puff of the joint and popped a handful of the pills into her mouth, washing it down with a swig of an amber coloured liquid.    She puffed the joint and sat down at her drums. She was more relaxed than she could ever remember herself being. This was what she wanted; to be at peace. She had no fear of possible death. It was a natural thing. The only was to forever be at peace, and thatâs six feet under.   She quickly felt the affects of the drugs. She smiled to herself.  âFinally, I get some peace.â Without warning, Grace felt a hand run up her spin and around her neck. A pang of painful thoughts ran though her body. She couldnât help but remember the events of two nights before. Her cheek began to throb againâ¦   * * * * * * * * *  Levi sat in his bedroom watching as the sun sank into the grey-blue waters of the Atlantic. On his lap sat his twelve string, his fingers running gracefully up and down its neck. Hanging above his head was a blue-green smoke. He had been smoking again.   Blackbird singing in the dead of night  Take these broken wings and learn to fly  All your life  You were only waiting for this moment to arise.  Levi heard the door bell ring, and sprang from his chair. Racing down the stairs, he looked though the window and saw Jenna standing on his front porch. Lust raced though his body as he slid to the door and grasped the doorknob. He took a deep breath and opened it. Before Levi could even say hello, Jenna had leaned in the door and kissed him. Levi pulled her in the door and stumbled backward, landing on the oak floor of the front hall.   Jenna giggled, âHello Levi.â Levi stood and helped Jenna up off the ground. âHello Jenna.â Jenna batted her eyelashes, making Levi gasp. âCome.â Jenna took Leviâs hand and pulled him back out the door and on the lawn. She swayed her hips as she made her way over to Leviâs bike, which was sitting the driveway.   âI gather youâd like me to take you somewhere!â âYes Levi. Take me wherever you want.â Levi placed one hand on Jennaâs hip, and took up a helmet with the other. He fastened it and handed Jenna the other.  Levi revved the engine as Jenna positioned herself on the back of the bike. Levi had always pictured himself with a beautiful girl, buzzing down the streets of the town, speeding toward the icy water.  Levi loved his motorcycle more than most things. It was a way of letting everything go. The wind in his hair, the freedom it broughtâ¦ it was more liberating than he could put into words.   Levi hit the gas and did a doughnut in his driveway, making Jenna cling to him even more than before. âTrying to impress me, Levi?â Smile laughed, but did not answer. He sped down the road toward Main Street, dodging oncoming traffic, playing children, and the occasional debris that fell from the tall trees.   * * * * * * * * *  âWell Grace. Are you going to co-operate with me this time?â Jason stood above her, staring down at her evilly. âJasonâ¦ What happened? You have other people who want to have sex with you. Please. Not me.â   Grace felt the same sick feeling she felt the night Jason raped her. Her insides shook as she looked around for her closest escape. Suddenly, Grace felt herself being lifted from the ground by her neck. She struggled to breathe as she was slammed into her bedroom wall. âOhâ¦ Why, that would be too easy. I want to teach you a lesson. You do NOT refuse me. EVER.â  âFineâ¦ Let me go, and Iâll do it willinglyâ¦ Just pleaseâ¦Donât.â Jason released his grip and sprung to his feet. He triumphantly sighed, whipping his hands on his pants. âYour floorâ¦ Itâs fuckinâ nasty.â He chuckled, offering his rough hand to her.  Grace stared in awe at Jasonâs sudden change in persona. The man that was trying to rape her just a few moments ago was offering her his hand.   Jason disappeared into Graceâs bedroom, leaving her standing alone in the kitchen, shaking.  Grace looked nervously around the room as she made her way into her bedroom to be with Jason.   Jason lay naked in her bed, the covers drawn smoothly over his waist and down. He looked eagerly into her eyes as she undressed. She stood before him, naked and shivering. Goosebumps crawled over her bare body as she watched Jasonâs icy eyes look her over.  âCome Grace, lie with me.â Jason grinned approvingly. Grace obediently stepped forward and slipped into the opposite side of her bed.  Jason ran his cold hand down her shoulder, over her abdomen, and over her chest, making her shiver. A sickening feeling came over her as Jason pulled her body to his.  âNo.â She said, pulling away from him. Grace felt a sharp pain in her side. A warm liquid ran down her left flank and down her stomach. She ran her hand down her side and could feel her blood dripping from a deep wound inflicted just below her ribs.  Intense pain ran from her shoulder to her hips.  In Jasonâs hand was a Swiss army knife. He laughed as he brought the blood covered blade up to his face and licked it. He leaned toward her and pressed his lips on the wound, licking the blood from the surrounding area.  âKiss me.â Jason ordered, pressing Grace into the bed. Jason placed his hand behind her head and exchanged a passionate kiss. The taste of blood on Jasonâs lips made Graceâs stomach turn.  âNowâ¦â Jason said, pulling away from her. âNo more bullshit from you. Do as I say, or I swear Iâll kill you.â  * * * * * * * * *  âHere we are.â Levi said, turning to Jenna. She said behind him, gazing in awe at the beautiful stars above them. She dismounted, followed by Levi, and walked forward onto the sandy shores of the private beach. âPerfect. This is exactly what I wanted.â She giggled. Levi came up behind her and put his hand on her shoulder. She turned around and kissed Levi passionately. They both sank to their knees, kissing each otherâs necks and running their hands down each otherâs backs.  * * * * * * * * *  Grace stood in the mirror, an old pistol pressed against her temple. Her hands shook and she readied herself for the end.   âGrace! Open up!â Riory yelled as he pounded violently on her bedroom door. The door shook from his continuous blows.  âGrace! What are you doing?â The panic in his voice heightened Graceâs anxiousness. âYou canât stop me, Riory.â Grace cried, her voice wavering. Silence. âYour notâ¦ Oh my godâ¦ Graceâ¦ NO!â Rioryâs distress was obvious. He continued to violently bang on the door, begging Grace to answer him. Grace laughed a haughty laugh and cocked her gun.   âGraceâ¦ Pleaseâ¦Donât.â Riory cried out, his voice choked by tears. His words made Grace stop in her tracks. The words had a familiarity to her. She had said the same thing, but to Jason the first time he raped her. Grace leaned over and unlocked the door. Within seconds, her brother burst into the room, his face stained with tears, and flung himself around her.   âGracie, what happened?  What did he do to you!â Grace stood still, her muscles tightening in defiance. âGrace. Please. Think about what youâre doing here. If you care about me at all, donât do this. You donât deserve this. Please. Listen to me here.â Riory sniffed and took her hand in his.   âGrace. Look at me.â Grace glared blankly into his maple eyes. So sincere they were that they melted her hardened heart. Grace collapsed, her limp body falling to the ground as if in slow motion. Grace could feel her brotherâs arms rap tightly around her. His biceps pressed like a tourniquet around the stab wound in her side. She wiggled and squirmed, trying desperately to loosen his grip.  âGraceâ¦ No! Stop it. Tell me what happened!â A flood of tears poured from Graceâs eyes. Riory loosened his grip and pressed his sisterâs head close to his shoulder. Quietly he sang, whispering Psalms and prayers.    âDid he hurt you, Gracie?â  Though Grace did not answer, it was clear that he did. âShow me.â Grace did nothing. âGrace! SHOW ME.â Grace sobbed ever still, digging her forehead into his shoulder. Riory lifted her shirt to see a swollen hole in her side. Blood oozed painfully from the wound, making them both feel sick.   âIt was right of him to do it. I lied to him. I told him Iâd do it without putting up a fight. I told him Iâd obey. I lied. I deserve this.â Rioryâs eyes went wide. âGrace. He doesnâtâ have the right to do this to you. He doesnât deserve YOU.â 	  âI donât deserve him.â   * * * * * * * * *  A blurâ¦ Confusedâ¦ Grace tried to sit up, but she was too weak. Sounds of activity made her head feel as if it would detonate. The bright lights stung her eyes. Everything hurt. âGraceâ¦ Graceâ¦ Itâs Rioryâ¦ Youâre alright.â  She felt a hand touch her own. âRioryâ¦Where am I?â She whispered frailly. âYouâre at the hospital.â Youâve been here for only a few hours. Weâre fixing you up. Donât worry.â 	 	  Chapter 5: The Underground  	 Grace took a deep breath of the damp air as she stepped leisurely onto the pavement outside her home. Her side panged with pain, but she was able to grunt her way though it.  It had been four days since she had left the hospital, and, until this point, she hadnât left her home. It felt good to be out and around the city. She had missed the cool air that blew in from the ocean.   âGrace!â She heard a voice call to her. âWant some company?â Her brother appeared from around the corner. âWhy do you insist on knowing where I am?â Grace rolled her eyes in annoyance. âGracieâ¦ GRACIEâ¦â Her brother snickered sarcastically. âIs their something wrong with wanting to be with my sister?â  Grace knew full well their parents had sent him to make sure that she wasnât trying to leave the house for good. Her brother was almost six years older, and they had very little in common.  Ever since the band spilt up that is.   âThere is when your sister is trying to get away from my preying eyes of her family.â Grace dug in her pocket and took out a cigarette. âYou know, thatâs horrible for you.â Riory scolded as he watched her lit the cigarette and light it.    âSince when do I care if something is bad for me? Did I not put a gun to my head less than a week ago?â Grace chuckled and puffed on her cigarette. Riory brought his hand up to his shoulder to starch his back.  âI know. That doesnât mean that I donât care. Iâm your brother, and I donât want to lose you to the tobacco companies.â  Riory words made Grace giggle with giddiness. âSeriously Grace.  You many as well go lick an ash tray.â Grace grinned at her brother mischievously. Grace was the last person youâd want to give ideas to. She hugged her brotherâs arm closely, swinging her opposite arm like a school girl walking home from her first day.   âDonât even think about it, Gracie.â Riory rolled his eyes and hugged his little sister. Riory was relieved that she was becoming a little more like herself again. He found it hard to believe that he almost lost her less than a week before. Then again, if you had told him she was going to try to kill herself, he would have called you crazy.   Grace skill in the dramatic arts was undeniable. This made it relatively easy for her to hide her true feelings about her surroundings. Riory could swear heâd not once seen Grace cry at their father and sisterâs funerals.   The sky opened up and rain pelted them as they walked. The smell of the rain on the asphalt calmed Graceâs nerves to the point Riory felt it was safe to approach her.  âSo how are you really, Grace?â Riory whispered to his sister. âIâm good. I talked to Jason and weâve made up.â Grace lied. She sped up to avoid getting her brotherâs âgod loves you, he doesnâtâ speech. She knew heâd do it anyway.  âIâm sorry.â Riory stopped in his tracks. âGrace became louder. âHe and I have made up. How hard is that to grasp.â âNot very, but what is hard to grasp is your motivation to be with Jason.â Grace laughed a bitter laugh.  	 âWeâre in love.â Riory ran after her to catch up. âNo graceâ¦ Now thatâs wrong. Explain the abuse and the raping. Why does that not bother you?â Grace took a long puff of her cigarette as f she was thinking. âIâm too stoned to care.â  âGrace. Come on! You arenât!â Riory ripped the âcigaretteâ from her lips with one hand and grabbed her arm with the other. âStop it!â Horror came over her face.   âSorry.â Riory let go quickly. âItâs not a joint.â Grace giggled and blew smoke in her brotherâs face. He coughed violent and turned his head away. âYouâre a frigging pansy.â  	 * * * * * * * * * 	 Levi stood silently next to Ben, watching his every move. Ben stared, frozen of time, into the distant sun. The wind beat at their faces, sprinklings of rain hit their cheeks.  	 âI canât stand it, Levi.â Ben finally spoke up. âElaineâs been treating me like shit.â Levi sighed. From the day they married eleven years ago, their dadâs new wife had disliked Ben. Levi was six when his mother killed herself. He was really too young to have a vivid memories of his birth mother, or her horrible death. He had been able to accept Elaine as a mother figure in his life unlike Ben. Ben was almost thirteen, and could not stand to have a âreplacementâ mother. 	 âSheâs threatened to kick me out of the house if I donât leave. She says Iâm a bad influence on âher son.â Ben looked as if he was going punch something. âShe meant you, Levi. You are her son. I was just an unwanted attachment in the deal.â  	 Levi didnât know what to say. He placed his hand on his brotherâs shoulder and sighed heavily, trying to this of the right words to say.  âDad married her for us, not himself.â Levi finally said. Ben turned to Levi and chuckled. âDad married her because he got her pregnant you faggot. Dad was just unlucky she lost the baby.â  	 Levi couldnât help but laugh. âIf she hadnât of gotten pregnant in the first place, then Pop would probably moved on and fucked someone else âtil it caught up with him.â Ben sighed. âI guess she sees that quality of Dad in me. She doesnât want it rubbing off on you. You where the only one who called her mom, so I guessâ¦â 	 âMaybe we should go see Os at the cafÃ©.â Levi interrupted his brother. Ben smiled at him and slapped him on the shoulder. âYou know what? I think we should!â  âWhen in doubt, go to the Underground.â Levi grinned and hugged his leather coat cold to his chilled body. A gust of cold wind on Leviâs wet face stung his skin. 	 Levi hummed quietly to himself as he and his brother walked over to their bikes, which sat waiting for them a few hundred feet away. âHowâs Jenna?â Levi gulped, remembering the night before. âGreat. Sheâs great.â âSo, how was she? I saw you snuck off with her a few nights before.â Ben grinned proudly.  	 Levi froze. He didnât think anyone saw him leave. âHow did you know?â Ben laughed at his little brother and swung his leg over the side of his motorcycle. âI was in the bushes.â Levi nodded and buckled his helmet. âKatie?â  	 âYou bet, Levi!â Ben laughed a satisfied laugh. âSheâs quiet the Bird.â Levi cracked his neck. âOhâ¦ You have no idea!â Ben revved his bikeâs engine and laughed. âShe rocks! I suggest you take her for a spin one of these days.â Ben winked and then took off. 	 Levi quickly started his bikes engine and followed him down the road in front of his house. Levi looked into the clouds he was riding into. Black and ominous in the distance, they looked curtain to bring cold, heavy rain. 	 Levi hit the gas and quickly caught up with his brother. They took turns revving their engines, doing pop-a- wheels, and screaming profanities into the wind. 	 This was the best place to be as far as Levi was concerned; blistering down the damp roads of Booth Bay Harbour, screaming into the wind so no one could hear your words. Levi felt free to express himself without worry of persecution or condemnation. This was his road and his life. He could do whatever he wished. He loved it. 	 Out of the corner of his eye, Levi spotted to figures walking down the sidewalk. âWant to flash and splash?â Ben yelled to his brother. Levi smiled, remembering the many times he had done things in a similar manner. âJust as Levi began to nod, he realised he knew the two pedestrians.  	 âNo! Pull over!â Levi motioned to his brother. A look of surprise came over Benâs face, but he did as Levi requested. As they approached, Ben slowly began to grin. âGo for it!â Ben nodded. 	 âGrace!â Levi called. The girl turned around and walked toward Levi. She looked beautiful despite she was soaked head to toe. âLevi, itâs nice to see you again.â She smiled and shook his hand. It was like ice to Leviâs skin. âHere.â Levi pealed off his coat and flung it over her shoulders. 	 âGrace, Riordan, this is my brother, Ben.â Grace leaned over and shook Benâs hand. Ben smiled flirtatiously and nodded.  	 âWhere you guyâs headed?â Riordan gritted his teeth. âThe Underground CafÃ©.â, Ben laughed. âThe lady can join us.â Grace smiled sweetly, and took a puff of the cigarette she was holding between her fingers.  	 Levi looked at his brother angrily. âRiordan can come to.â Ben looked at his brother as if he had just insulted him. âSure, sure!" Whatever.â Riory nodded and placed his hand on Graceâs back to push her forward toward the bikes.  	 âYouâre with me, Grace.â Ben chuckled, nodding sweetly to the girl. She put out her cigarette and grabbed a hold of a helmet that sat on the back of Benâs bike. Riory grabbed a second one on the back of Leviâs bike, placed it on his head, buckled it, and climbed up on the back of Leviâs bike.   * * * * * * * * *  	 âHold on!â Levi and Ben simultaneously hit the gas and sped again down the road toward the Underground. Grace found it hard to keep her eyes off Levi. Every minute or so, her eyes would meet his.   	 Levi couldnât keep his eyes on the road. A lump the size of a chicken egg formed in the back of his throat every time his eyes met Graceâs. âMaybe Iâll get lucky tonight.â Levi said to himself. âWink, Leviâ¦ Do it.â He winked, making the girl smile. Maybe he WOULD get lucky tonight. 	 The brotherâs bikes came to an abrupt stop after what seemed to be only seconds after they had left the sidewalk. âHow long did that take?â Grace asked Levi. She turned her head inquisitively toward him, resembling Leviâs old dog. Levi chuckled and helped Grace off the back of Benâs bike. âAbout twenty minutes...â  âBut time flies when you spend it staring at an attractive lad like Levi here.â Ben chimed in. Grace turned beat red. âThanâ¦thank you, Levi.â  	 Levi swung open the front door of the cafÃ© and led Grace inside. The cafÃ© was large, but felt small because of the rowdy crowd. The walls were painted wild colours; strobe lights lit the room, making you want to dance. The latest hits blared loudly from the many speakers in the room.  	 Levi offered Grace his hand and smiled. âThis is awesome!â Grace yelled over the music. âI thought youâd like it.â Levi laughed, putting his things down on one of the tables. His brother had already left to go chat with a group of girls standing in the corner. Riory was looking around the room suspiciously, as always.  	 A waiter in blue and black came up to their table, baring a tall tea cup. âOh Osseo! Thanks a bunch man!â Levi laughed, smacking the young man on the shoulder. âWhat would you like?â The young man asked Riory. âCappuccino.â  He answered hesitantly. âSure! sure! And for the lady?â Grace smiled flirtatiously at the man. âBlack coffee.â   	 âDid you pre-order?â  Riory asked Levi once the man left. âOh no, I didnât. Thatâs my friend, Oswyn. I order the same thing every time I come, so heâs gotten used to it.â Grace giggled. âYouâre havenât changed a bit!â Levi gave Grace a funny look.  	 âWell, Iâm still British, is thatâs what you mean.â This made Grace laugh. âThatâs right. You are still British. Itâs just been so long, I forgot.â Grace turned to her brother, who was listening in quietly. âLevi and I had some of the same classes in ninth grade when he moved over from England.â  	 Riory started to laugh. âOh! So youâre Mr. Kaisner. I must admit, I heard many good things about you a few years back.â Grace turned beet red. She told Riory she had a crush on him, but never imagined theyâd ever been with each other long enough to bring up the subject. 	 âGracie?â Levi chuckled. âSo you did fancy me!â âI was just fourteen for godâs sake!â âSo youâre too good for me now, eh?â Grace could not help but laugh at his words. âYouâre too good for ME.â She replied, averting her eyes.  	 âOh, dear Grace. You are deceived. Think better of yourself, for youâre a fineâ¦ fineâ¦ FINE young woman.â Levi said in his posh English impersonation. Grace blushed as she felt Leviâs hand touch her knee from under the table. Rioryâs face tightened in reservation. The drinks, in his mind, came just in time. 	 âThis is really nice. Iâve never been to a place like this.â âYou need to get out more Gracie! Good God! If you werenât so scary looking Iâd say youâve been living under a rock for the last three years!â  Riory looked Levi over with a questioning eye. âYou much have been the instigator of the familyâ¦â  	 âWellâ¦ No. Thatâd be Asherâ¦ The bloody twerp!â âWipe that STUPID look of you face!â Grace giggled and playfully cuffed Riory over the head.  	 âSo you have another brother?â Grace took a sip of her coffee. âWell, I have a few brothers. Theyâre eight, five, four, two, and twins due in a few months.â Graceâs eyes went wide. âItâs my fatherâs second wife. My mother died when I was seven.â Levi turned to where his brother was standing. âHe was thirteen.â  	 âYeah, our father and sister died in a car accident.â Riory piped in. âThree years ago, right?â Levi smiled. âI remember. Grace stopped talking to me when they died.â  	 The three sat in silence, sipping their drinks of choice and contemplating their conversation. Levi stared into Graceâs deep eyes, waiting for her to say something. The minutes flew by until Levi felt he had to speak up.  	 âSo whatâs new with you Grace?â Levi put his head in his hand to listen to Grace. âWell, Iâ¦â Grace stopped in mid-sentence hand gripped her side. Her face tightened and tears formed in her eyes. 	 âWhatâs wrong? Graceâ¦ Sit down.â Grace was speechless. Though she had known Levi for a while now, she had no id ea what he would tell Jenna, and in turn, what Jenna would tell Jason.  Levi led her back to the table and sat her down. 	 âItâs nothing! Iâve aggravated an injury. I just had an accident involving a freshly mopped floor. They can be dangerous business! Nothing huge, donât worry.â By the look on Rioryâs face, Levi could tell that Grace was lying, but Levi wasnât about to dig for details. If he was going to have a chance with her, he knew it was best to keep his mouth shut. 	 âGrace and I just broke with the band we were playing with.â Riory chuckled, leaning back lazily in his chair. âYou play?â Levi smiled enthusiastically as he swung his arms to the beat. He cringed in pain as the skin stretched. âI play bass, and Grace here plays the drums.â Levi nodded. âSo you did take them up. I thought you never would.â  	 âWhat? Did you think I was too wimpy?â Levi gave Grace a quaint smirk. âExactly what I thought, Gracie. You read my mind.â Grace ignored him. âYou still play the guitar?â âOh, of course I do!â  	 âWell, Grace and I are having a band practice. Weâve got a group of people coming over to play tomorrow night. Youâre welcome to comeâ¦â âAs long as you bring the Rickenbacker!â Grace interrupted her brother. She had so many memories about that guitar.  	 âSounds good to me, love.â âWell, we need to get home, Grace. Youâve been on your feet too long.â Levi waved his brother over as he listened to Riory. 	 âYeah, man?â âWe need to take these guys home.â Ben sighed unhappily. âAnd Iâm taking Grace this time. She and I want to hang out for a bit longerâ Levi poked Ben in the side. âAs you wish!â 	 Levi grabbed Graceâs hand a practically dragged her out of the cafÃ©. Graceâs heart was beating rapidly, as if she was running away from something. She stopped and pulled Levi close to her chest. They stared into  each-others eyes. Levi leaned forward and kissed her sweetly on the lips. He felt her tongue creep slowly into his mouth, but he quickly pulled away when he saw Riory and Ben make their way outside.  	 âYes. Wellâ¦ We better get you homeâ¦ Graceâ¦â     Chapter 6: To Love Her    âOkay. I have everythingâ¦ Pause. I have the amps, if we even need them. Iâm positive. Look, Grace, I have it covered! Be there in a few. Bye!â  Levi ended his third phone call of the day with Grace and slid his last guitar into the back of his brotherâs car.    The more he talked to Grace, the more her realised he wanted more than a one-night stand.  Unlike many of the other girls he had been with, she really cared about him. Despite what Oswyn and his brother told him to do, Levi would not push Grace to do anything with him. First, he wanted to catch up with her about what had happened over the last months. 	 âOkay. Six and twelve string Rickenbackers, my Hofner bass, my President, and two amps. Sounds like a good mix to me.â   Levi jumped into the car. He was excited. He was far more excited than he had been in a long while. He finally had someone who shared his love of old music. In addition, having Grace as a sexy young girl made it even better, but it was no longer his priority. Something inside of him told him this was part of his destiny. He revved the engine of the 1999 green neon sport and sighed contently. Maybe, just maybe, he would get to know Grace even more.  His palms became sweaty as he thought about what the night could bring. The success of the night was a key part in the possible love connection with Grace. He had to make a good impression on both Grace and her brother. She needed to trust him enough to let him back into her life. He had to prove to Grace that he was not the boy he was three years before. He cared about her now, and wanted to know what her life was like.  109, Hunterâs Court. Levi was at the Cleeton home. Memories flooded his mind as he pulled up in the gravel driveway.  The house was small, and looked eerie at first glance. Two black cats sat on the porch, watching intently as Levi got out of his car.   âHello Levi.â Riordan answered the door. âHey! Riory, could you do me a favour, love?â âSure, whatâd need?â Riory gave Levi a funny look. âI need a bit of help caring some equipment into the house.â âErr. What kind of equipment are we talking here?â Levi smiled eccentrically. âMy babies.â Riordan followed Levi out to his car and was amazed at what he saw. Four guitars cases and two amps. Levi WAS a musician.   âWow! I had no idea you played all this!â Levi opened the car door and grabbed the two amps, one in each hand. âI tend not to advertise. Carry the babies with care. Iâve got two Rickenbackers in there.â Levi turned to go into the house, and left Riordan standing there, shocked.   Grace was standing at the door, ready to help him carry the amps inside. âI brought the good stuff, love.â âOh yeah! You brought the Rickenbacker and its amp?â Levi smiled. âCirca 1964 if Iâm correct, Levi?â Levi shook his head as if disgusted. âNo! 1965.â Levi stuck his tongue out at her tauntingly.    âHere.â Riordan placed his guitar cases at his feet. âLetâs see what youâve got.â Levi grinned. Levi opened the Rickenbacker six-string blondie. Grace and Riordan looked on in awe.  âI my god, it's Lennon's guitar!â Grace smiled. âNot his, but made at the same time and itâs the same model. My grandfather bought it in Liverpool in 65, along with this one...â He opened the next case. âThis guitar is identical in model to Harrisonâs guitar twelve string." Twelve string Rickenbacker blondie. It's rare as an angel in hell.â He passed it to Riordan. âYouâve got great action on both of these suckers.â Grace giggled, plucking away at the six-string. âI take it you like the Beatles, Levi!â He did not answer.   âSunburst Hofner Bass. Same model as McCartney.â Said a voice. Two young men in their late teens to early twenties stood in the hallway. One took a few steps forward and took a hold of Leviâs hand. âJosh Mikens and this is my friend, Chris Baker. Glad you came.â Riordan smiled at his sister, who was nodding to confirm his words.    âYou play bass as well as guitar?â Riordan was stunned. Maybe he had been praying for this man. âYes, although, my brother is far better than I shall ever be. I also play piano, drums, and classical guitar. "Why donât we jam a bit?â Levi suggested. It was obvious that he was itching to play some music with these new people. âSounds great!â Grace was glowing. Levi could tell that she was ready to play. âAlright.â   Levi ran his hands up and down the warn leather cases. âYou take this one.â Levi handed Riordan his bass. âYou sure?â Riordan asked. âYeah! Go ahead!â Riordan took the instrument in his hands and strummed. Grace jumped in behind the drums. Chris and Josh picked up Leviâs President and his twelve string Rickenbacker.  âWhat do we all know how to play?â Riordan asked. Levi smiled and strummed in the key of G. Grace laughed and gave him a funny look. âJust to Know." Levi laughed as he nodded to Grace. She winked and softly hit her drum set. Levi showed Riordan the cords as he sang.  Just to know, know, know her Is to love, love, love her Just to see her smile Makes my life worth whileâ¦  Levi looked Grace in the eye and smiled.  This bold move was very different from what Levi was accustom to. Yet, Grace was very different from what he was used to. She looked especially radiant tonight. Pair tight jeans, holes patched with black lace. Her shirt made from the same black lace, with a low-cut neckline. Her dark hair was in chopsticks. She was naturalâ¦ She was innocent.   Just to know, know, know her Is to love, love, love her And I do, and I do, and I doâ¦  Grace smiled at Josh and Chris, who sat and watched Levi. She did this because she was trying to conceal her feelings. Happiness, confusion, and sadness flooded her heart. He was so closeâ¦ but too far away to grasp. He offered, and then stepped away. It was almost as if he was taunting her, just as a bullfighter taunts his bull. She loved him, yet could never have him. He was far out of her reach. It could never be.   âOh, Iâm sure a guy like you has some nice spunky ones under his belt.â Chris laughed. Grace tapped impatiently on her drums, then broke out into a beat that made everyone in the room feel compelled to start a mosh pit.   Levi banged on his guitar a melody, and then began to sing in falsetto. Graceâs smile turned into an ecstatic grin. He had remembered. When they where friends three years before, Grace had sung the song for the talent show.  Iâm gonna drink my whisky  Gonna have my man I know you have nothing to say Iâm gonna have my man Gonna steal their hearts In addition, save âem for a rainy day  	 Grace stood on her wobbly legs, and then fell to the ground in laughter. Levi began to laugh as well. He crawled to where Grace was laughing and collapsed onto her stomach. The feeling of her diaphragm vibrating beneath his ear made the hair on the back of his neck stand up.  Grace looked to see Leviâs head resting in her stomach. She used all her might to sit up and pull his head to her shoulder. The touch of his calloused fingertips on her forearm mad her laugh even more. Levi sounded just as Grace did.  Squeaky, crude, and unpractised. He struggled to continue his song, but could not bare it any longer.   Grace and Levi both realised quickly that they were being watched; something they both (one more secretly than the other) was not true. Riory, Chris, and Josh where staring at them intently, waiting for them to pull themselves together.  âYouâre great for this band, Levi. You seem to complete it.â Riory chuckled. âBut there is only one catch.â Josh shook his head. âAnd that one catch would be what?â Levi asked mischievously, hugging Grace close to his body. âYou canât mess around with the drummer while weâre on stage.â Levi howled with laughter. He felt Graceâs hand rub his shoulder. âI must admit, it must be kind of hard to carry a tune when youâre locking lips.â   Rioryâs face went red. Though his natural instinct was to keep boys away from his sister, he trusted Levi.  For the life of him, he could not explain why, but he did anyway.  Grace hugged Levi and wiggled from his embrace. âWould you like guys like a drink?â She asked him, coming up to her knees. Levi nodded and grabbed her hand. âIâll help you out.â   Grace helped him up off the ground and smiled at him. Her heart was pounding; she was speechless staring into his eyes. âOh, alright.â Is all she was able to say.  Grace nervously led Levi into her kitchen. She absentmindedly dug though the deep cabinets to find a bottle of soda. âAre you okay, Grace?â Levi laughed as he came behind her and reached into the cupboard and grabbed her hand to steady it. Grace set the bottle down and turned around to face Levi. He looked genuinely into her eyes.  Before she knew it, her arms where wrapped around him in a loving embrace.  âIâve missed to, Grace.â Levi laughed and rubbed her back. âI forgot how much fun it was to be with you.â Grace blushed. She never new he enjoyed her company that much. âWhat has been happening in your life?â   âWell. My mother got remarried, for one!â Levi chuckled. âMr. Klein! I never would have guessed!â Grace shook her head. âI try not to make it obvious. My life at school would be hell if everyone knew. I do not hide it. Nor do I like to advertise!â   âI grew!â Levi laughed. Just three years before, he had been just barely five foot. Now he was pushing 6â3. âI noticed!â Grace took the bottle of coke and opened it. She took a dainty sip and handed it to Levi.  âSweet.â She whispered. He laughed and brought the bottle to his lips. âIâll show you sweet.â He pressed her body up against the kitchen counter and planted a juicy kiss on her full lips. Grace giggled. âOooahh! Sweet!â   To Be Continued!  Please leave a post with your ideas here or e-mail at ambler_madley@hotmail.com!  Thanks!  ambler

      Beyond the Shadows  Amber Hadley   Beyond the shadows There is nothing much to see All that is left Is this, in me The shadow wanderer The lost soul of Gaul That is all that is left This is all, this is me  Hiding with Lennon and Cobain Lying with shadows on the wall Dwelling in a world with razor-blade rain And the crimson bloodshed falls This is all, this is me  Cocaine sky above me Pools of blood below  Now Iâm bloody and broken Screaming, thieving, weeping Oh, donât bother save me Donât try to hold me from the inevitable To fight would be suicide This is all, this is me  So please, sit comfortable While I draw my last breathe And say goodbye to this cruel world Forever Iâll sleep outside your tourniquet grip Beyond the shadows Six foot under In that back of your empty-head

      Well, this is my first of many (I hope). I've been sitting around here for a little while, trying to think of what I should say. In my case, trying to come up with something intelligent is futile anyway, so it really doesn't matter!  Hey! Everybody do me a favour and check out this new page my friend Johnny sent me!    urlLink The most annoying webpage ever!   Enjoy!  ambler

      Arg...  It's hot, stuffy, I'm tired. and I'm using a piece of crap computer. Why, oh why, did my parents keep with hunk of shit anyway?  The yard sale did alright... Not as well as I had hoped... but it was good enough. We made a good deal of money; I only saw 10% though...  I, personally, don't think it was worth it, but hey! I'm not gonna complain. I've got fifty bucks in my pocket, a somewhat happy mother, and a chillin' set of sisters.   We leave for the cabin in six days. Won't that be LOADS of fun. Stuck in an inclosed space, no computer or internet access, no TVS... Just water... and dirt... And nasty fish. I can't wait.... Really.   *Pisses herself in intisipation*  Yes... We're all be so RELAXED there. (That is, if we don't see each other)  Not much else to talk about really. I better go.  ambler

      It's late so I'll make this quick...  I have been feeling a little better, but I'm not great. Fueds between my sisters and I have hit the point where we can hardly be in the same room together. Stressing about the yard sale, "Bobby", and my upcoming vacation is making everyone in the house, including me, a little crabby.  I've done a little on the next chapter... Yeah... Just a little...  g2g  amber

      I'm sick... Again.  Not much is going on today. Mostly getting ready for the yard sale my mother insists we have. All too time consuming if you ask me. I have better things to do, but it doesn't matter to her.   It's hot in here...   *Gets up and opens a window*   That's better...Sleeping on the problem involving "Bobby" did no good. It just gave me a killer migrain. I was thinking far too much. I have noticed that I'm getting them more... Not a good thing. I just need to shut my mind off for a while.   Turn off your mind... Relax, and float down stream... It is not dieing... It is not dieing...  Thing is, I missed church last night because I was sick. It's strange. I don't feel my usually guilt for skipping Church last night. I'm even a little releaved. THAT, my friend, is a very long story.   Let's just put it this way: I know I will be rubuked, and I don't deal with it well. Half the time I burst into tears, the other half I get bloody furious and start swearing my head off. I don't want either. I just want to be left alone.   But I know that's not the way things work.   Ambsy

      Oh dear, what can I do... Baby's on Crack and I'm sniffing glue...  *Turns, startled, and slaps the reader*   No comments in ages! Come on people! Don't die on me? Well... I guess I've died on you. I must delay the next chapters for a few more days, at least. I am contemplating where the story is going down the road, and trying to get some kind of foresight. But I will finish. I promise.   *Give a sweet smile*  Not much is going on now. I'm kind of in a rut, actually. My writing has been bad lately. Mostly because I have been thinking too much. About trivial... and important things. I promised myself I would not think about it... or write it here... However, it is not like anyone actually read this! It is about a guy.  *Blushes and giggled uncontrollably*   I very nice person. He is attractive, funny, and very caring. Thing is, he is so far from my reach that it is not worth even thinking about him. Yet, still, I do. It is odd.  I never really thought of myself as one to just have a crush on a guy. In the past, I have always been very open about it, and we end up being together. Nevertheless, with this boy, who we will call *Bobby* for some amount of secrecy, is much different. "Bobby" is far to close to me to talk to him. It also seems that whenever we get the chance to talk... It just does not happen. It is strange.  I am not saying he is avoiding me. He could be, but with him, it is hard to tell. He is just distancing himself from me, which I would not blame him for doing. I have no idea if he feels the same way, but I am sure he does not. Almost 100% sure actually...   *Tear runs down her cheek*  Which kind of makes me sad. This isn't the first time I've felt this way about *Bobby*. As a matter of fact, it was only a few months ago when I decided my crush on him was futile. Now that the summer is closing and my friends and I are spliting up to go on to different paths, I look to him again, and wish I had a chance to tell him how I feel.    I have contempating talking to my family at the father's house about it, but they will probably think it's a bad idea. One, *Bobby* is older than I am. Second, most of them think dating when you aren't seriously looking for someone to marry is a bad idea. Third, our relationship would be long distance... which I've done before.   I need to sleep on this...  ambler

      Well,  Only one thing has changed with my sister Brianne. She's more anal than ever! Freaking out about the stupidest things... But I can live with it... I'll have to. I don't have a choice in the matter.  I spent most of yesterday at my friend's Doug and Suzanne's house. I had a lot of fun, and I was glad I was able to sit back and relax for a little while. I have been busy working on my story and looking at options for self-publishing.   So, for now, I'll leave it at that. I would like to try and talk to my old friend again. Hopfully he won't put up a wall with me again.   And, be sure tp check out the President's Website!http://www.georgewbush.com  "Michael Moore, one of these days, will be shot...And I'll laugh!" - Bebe Renolds  Ambershai

      Arg...  Today, I feel horrible. I was up on and off all last night, violently ill, but now I just feel yucky. (Whitch, in my mind, is worse!) I;m going to a waterpark tomorrow with my friend Jessica, so hopefully I'm feeling better by then.  Between trips to the bathroom, I was able to get quite a bit of my story done. A very good thing! Now, I'm working on was little editing I am capable of. My plan is to have chapters 9-12 up sometime in the next week. How many of you think it isn't going to happen? *Huff's hand goes up* Well... You're wrong. *Slaps him acrossed the face with a dead fish*

      Woo Woo!  *Sighs* Well, after a labourous night/morning, I was finally able to finish the eighth chapter of Saving Grace, and most of the ninth.   This next chapter, I think, is one of the better ones. It is full of suspence and, in some cases, pretty scary things. But I'm sure nobody will have a problem with it.  Now, I'm trying to download Java so I can throw flaming banana's at my friend Jesse. What an interesting life I lead.   I'll write again soon,  Ambershai ;)

      Ahem...  It's five days until my sister, Brianne, becomes a landed alien! LMAO! I can't wait to call her that to her face. She'll get a kick out of that!  Saving Grace is coming along painfully slow! So many ideas, I could explode! I have a bunch of story ideas also on the table about a homisidal chain-smoker who kills his girlfriend, one of John Lennon's lovers (Fiction of course), Benjamin Adams (Also fiction... I'm getting a feeling that I've got a pattern here...), a warrior prince, and a prisoner of war. Yeah. A lot.  Please read the newst chapter and enjoy it. A lot of blood and sweat went into that sucker. Be patient, and you'll have the next four chapters!  Thankx  Ambsy

      Howdy!  The picnic was great! Jessi and I had loads of fun playing vollyball with Jesse :P and the other guys! Every once in a while the heavens opened up, but God did bless us with a few mintutes of beauitul sun! Woo woo! Praise God!  Just getting out and spending some down time with my friends helped hugely with my frustration. The best way for me to release is to be surrounded by my brothers and sisters in God. To talk things out and get biblical views on my problem.  Now for the bombshell. Saving Grace is indeed a christian story. Plans in the future lead both Grace and Levi to christ. Woo woo! Amen! Great story ending, don't you think? Or, should it be just the beginning? I know from experience, there really is no life but though Jesus Christ. *Thinks* Aye... Maybe it'll have a sequel!   ambler

      Chapter 7: Bitterness Explodes   Levi sat quietly in his room, think about the night he had kissed Grace one month before.  His motivations had changed when it came to her. The time he had spent with the girl, the more he felt himself fall in love with her.  Grace was confusing. She teased him with her body. âOnly if I know you are fully mine.â She had said. He would half to give up all the other girls in his life. Two weeks ago, he turned her down, but now, he doubted his decision. He wanted her, and he was just about willing to do anything to get her.  There was no denyingâ¦ Levi loved Grace. He has spent two weeks by her side almost constantly. She was kindâ¦ caringâ¦ All she really needed was the same.  He had found what he twice thought he had with Jenna. He had found someone who was sincere; a genuine person. She had no other agenda on their mind, other to get to know Levi better. It was her most attractive aspect.   The clock chimed. It was 1:00 in the morning, and Ben still was not home from Katieâs house. Levi could hear his parents quietly bickering in the kitchen, trying not to wake the children. Glossy-eyed, he stared at his reflection in the mirror. He was a mess. A combination of blood from his cuts on his body and dirt his bike had kicked up when he was riding earlier covered him from head to toe.    Levi stood from where he was lying in bed and ran his hand though his spiked hair. He took a deep breath and walked over to his closet. There was no use sitting at home when he could be out on the town. He flung the heavy doors open and randomly selected an outfit. It was black jeans and a t-shirt, with silver seams.  He slipped them on gingerly and made his way down the stairs.   * * * * * * * * * 	 Grace lay in a restless sleep in her large bed. The moon shined blue though the windows, giving her pale skin an eerie blue colouring.   Jason voice echoed though her dreams. "Oh, come on Grace! Loosen up. You love me don't you?" She shivered as wind blew in from the cracks in the floorboards.  The memories and the pain of the night six weeks before flashed though her head, making her shake uncontrollably. Her body ached as she tossed and turned, then finally; she sat up and looked around the room.  She sighed in relief and pulled the blankets up around her chilled body and laid back down as she realised she was alone. Tears ran warmly down her icy cheeks as she stared blankly out her bedroom window and into the full moon.  âGracieâ¦ Gracieâ¦â She heard a voice whisper forcefully from a crossed the room. Her eyes widened and her heart raced. She shook in fright daring not turn toward her bedroom door. It was himâ¦  Grace heard the footsteps of the intruder on the hardwood floor become louder. âGrace.â The voice whispered again, this time louder. She felt a hand touch her shoulder and turn her over.  âOh my god! Levi!â she reached upward toward him and held him closely. Levi croaked quietly. âGraceâ¦ Graceâ¦ Hush my loveâ¦â He looked at her and felt like crying.  She looked pale, her face streaked with tears. âWhatâs wrong?â âIâm fine. Just been watchingâ¦â She turned her head toward the window and pointed. She looked at him as if she was going to cry, then gave a fake laugh.  Levi pulled her closely to his chest, but reeled in pain and pulled away. âStopâ¦ please! Graceâ¦ Wait.â Shock covered Graceâs face. Did she suspect something?   âWhat? Baby, are you okay? Iâm sorryâ¦I get you in the eye or something?â She giggled sweetly and pulled him back in to her. âNoâ¦ Iâm fineâ¦ Pleaseâ¦ Just stop.â She let him go and sat up. Her caramel brown eyes where red with tears. Shaking, she took his hand. Levi cringed, but tried to hide it. Grace eyed Levi carefully. She ran her thin fingers back and forth a crossed his arms, stroking them and watching for his reaction.  âWhat are you doing?â âGrace. Stop.â He whispered. âI donât want you to see me like this.â âAre you hurting yourself?â Levi was stared at her silently. âLeviâ¦ Answer me.â Graceâs voice wavered and she began to cry again. âOh Grace, donât cry! Iâll be okay. I donât want you to see me like this!â He clenched his teeth and stared at the purple-blue coloured wall.   Tears swelled up in Graceâs eyes. She was shocked that Levi, who on the outside appeared so happy, was in fact, just as depressed and lonely as she. Leviâs life was seemingly perfect. An older brotherâ¦ younger siblingsâ¦ Parents that loved him. She was tempted to roll up his sleeves to see the damage, but was also scared of what she might find. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. âShow me.â  Levi did not believe what he heard. âShow me Levi.â She said again. His head hung, as if he where a puppy being scolded for peeing on a newly carpeted floor. Gashes from his cutting where from his wrists up to his elbows and he knew that eventually, someone would discover them. It was bound to happen, so who better then Gracie?  She would understand what he was going though, just as he would understand her trials.  She leaned over to see as he took off his sweater and revealed his arms, scared and bruised, and in some cases, bleeding. She gasped, stared at him for a moment, and sat up straight.   âGrace, donât worry about me. Please do not cry. Please.â âHe hit meâ¦ and raped meâ¦ manyâ¦ many times.â Levi looked up at Gracie, tears flowing down her cheeks. She was breathing heavily, and shaking with the memories of her past. Leviâs eyes widened as her words computed in his head. Abuseâ¦ RAPEâ¦!  âWhoâ¦ Who did this to you?â âIt was my entire fault anyway. I did not make him happyâ¦ I didnât love him enough.â âTELL ME GRACE!â Levi grabbed her arms tightly, just as Jason had a month before. She yanked away from his grip and angrily whispered, âDo not touch meâ¦ You are like himâ¦ you are ALL like himâ¦ want to hurt meâ¦ want to see me dead, donât you! DONâT YOU!â   âGraceâ¦ Listen to meâ¦ Listenâ¦ Pleaseâ¦ Its Leviâ¦I am trying to help you. If I wanted to see you dead, would come to see you here every day. I would not kiss you the way I do. I would not tell you I love you more than life itself. I want to see MYSELF dead! Please!â  âWho did this to you, Grace? Tell me.â Grace refused to speak. She nudged closer to Levi, avoiding his gashed. She looked him in the eyes, and her rage subsided. âLevi, Iâm sorry. I did not mean it. I know you love me. I love you. Donât leave me.â Levi held her close, kissing her face and neck. âOh Gracie, love me while Iâm here. Iâll protect you as long as I am alive.â   Levi kissed her again and sank down into her bed. âPlease do not tell anyone.â Levi looked up a half smile. âYou still havenât told me who it was. Just tell me Grace.â Grace wrapped her arms and legs around Leviâs toned body. âJason.â   Leviâs heart raced. Jason had stolen Jenna from him and had hurt the one person he loved. A look of horror flooded Graceâs eyes and softened Leviâs anger. âItâs okay Grace. You are mine, not his. Iâll never hurt you again.â A grin covered Graceâs face. âYes. I am fully yours.â  Levi watched Grace as she closed her eyes and relaxed. She looked beautiful in the moonlight. She was perfect.  He could not ask for anyone better. Levi felt lust come over him. He caressed Graceâs cheek tenderly as his body went numb. Grace opened her eyes and smiled.    * * * * * * * * *  Levi was disoriented for only a second when woke up. He was still with Grace. He looked over to her lying on the other side of the bed, and smiled.  He wished deeply he could stay longer, but it was almost 3:00 am.  Levi crept from the bed and picked his shirt up off the floor. He turned his head to look at Grace again. She slept peacefully, a broad smile on her face.   He dressed quickly, kissed Grace on the lips, and slipped out the door. Leviâs bike sat bathing in the cool light of the full moon. It was a beautiful night for riding, but he found himself longing to go back inside and be with Grace. His heart beat heavily just thinking of her beautiful smile.   âNice to see you here, Mr. Kaisner.â Said a voice from behind him. Levi turned to see Jason standing behind him clad fully in black. âWhat are you doing here?â Levi asked angrily. âI asked you first.â Jason smiled proudly. âI was with Grace.â âAnd I was waiting for you.â   Leviâs face turned red. Levi had given up fight over Miss Sheraton with Jason, and now he was coming to claim Grace. He couldnât let that happen. He had promised Grace just hours ago that he would protect her. Heâd do it, even if he was killed trying.  âDAMNIT. Just leave the girl alone! Havenât you done enough? You had your fun! I know what youâve done to her, you sick bastard!â âLook Kaisner.â Jasonâs frigid eyes bore into Leviâs, which only made him more angry.   âShe my girl. I can do whatever I want to her, whenever and wherever I want! Fuck off and keep your crusty British ass out of my business.â Levi was hot with rage. How could he speak like that about Grace? He did not give a damn about her.  âYouâre a bloody bastard! You can crib around and molest your other fucking prostitutes, but it will be my blood on your vile hands the day you again TOUCH GRACE!â A sudden burst of pain shot like a bullet through Leviâs head. The familiar warm feeling of blood dribbled down his cheek. He wavered but kept his ground.   âIs that I promise or a dare, Mr. Kaisner?â Levi gritted his teeth. The sickening taste of blood filled his mouth. Jabbed, kick, trip, kick, kick, jab. Jason fell to the ground in a heap. âA promise.â   âYou son of a bitch! How dare you tell me what to do? What makes you think you can protect that obstinate crow?â Jason laughed coldly as he yanked him to the ground. Levi tried to see where Jason was, but could not see him. âYou touch Grace, and youâll be getting more from me, I can guarantee you that much!â Jason curled his fists in rage and spit in his face. Levi called out and threw a final blow. âYour blood on my hands.â    * * * * * * * * *  âWhat the HELL happened to you?â âNothing Dad, donât worry.â âSonâ¦yer face is leakinâ all over me carpet. Do all yer leakinâ in the kitchen or the loo please.â Mr. Kaisner chuckled from the couch. Leviâs mother appeared from hallway, little Samuel, sleeping peacefully in her arms. The apron she wore drew attention to her swelled abdomen. âElaine, Iâll take the lad.â  âThank ya, Thomas. You come with yer mum, darlinâ. With much shrieking and kicking, Mrs. Kaisner turned over sleeping Samuel to her husband.  âWhatâd those bastards do to you?â âTHOMAS!â âSorry Hunâ¦â âGot in ta a bit of a barneyâ¦â Levi laughed. His father being scolded for a foul mouth made Levi want to roll on the floor in laugher. Leviâs mother stood in front of him with a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a ratty looking cloth. Pain gripped Levi as she gently dabbed his forehead.   âDonât hurt that bad, I take it.â Their mother sighed. âLadsâ¦ seventeen and Iâm still bandaginâ up yer wounds.â She laughed massaging her stomach. âThanks be to Zeus if these lilâ ones are lassies. If not, curses ta yer pa!â âIs Ben alright?â She asked Levi. He shrugged. âI donât know. I wasnât with him.â A look a white anger flooded her face. âWhat are you meaninâ by that, child?â âI havenât seen him.â   Just then, the screen door crashed open. Benâs voice could be heard from the living room. âWhere havâ you been?â Levi father questioned Ben. âKatieâs.â âElaineâs been worried sick.â âLike I give a shit.â  Ben burst though the kitchen door to find Elaine and Levi there. Elaine dropped her things and slapped Ben swiftly across the face. âYou do NOT speak like that in my house. I have my boys to raise here!â Ben stood silently before her.   Levi watched in horror as his brother quickly raised his hand and slapped Elaine twice as hard as she had slapped him. She reeled backward in shock, eyes wide and filled with tears. âDonât touch me. Alright?â  Seeing his brother hit Elaine, made Levi think of what Jason must had done to Grace. Horrible pictures filled his mind. âOne of these dayâs youâll get that girl pregnant!â Elaine cried. âThen youâll be sorry youâve slept with her!â Ben looked at Elaine and chuckled. Both Elaine and Levi could smell the whisky on his breath.   âAye, thing is, Iâve already shacked her up Mum. Just as dad shacked you up, ya whore! Too bad, you cannot keep a baby! I am a married man as of two hours ago. Congratulate me!â  Levi was shocked and frightened of his brother, which he had very been before. He had never seen Ben so violent, but in some ways he was not surprised after hearing him talk about Elaine before. He just wished he knew what to do.   âThomas!â Elaine called out. Their father was standing in the doorway. Anger flashed over him. âCongratulations. Now get the bloody hell out of my house. You do not speak to me wife that way, nor do ya put a HAND on her! She loses âer babies because of you, and I swear child, it will be yer head!â Ben nodded. âSure. Iâm out.â Shoved his father out of the doorway, grabbed his things from the living room, and slammed the front door shut with such a force that the walls shook. The noise made Sam wail pitifully.  âExcuse me Thomas.â Elaine said, motioning him to move to the side. âYou finish with Levi.â She walked solemnly into the living room and held Samuel in her arms. Tears filled her eyes. âLevi, leave us for a while please.â   Chapter 8: The Fib  The morning sun shined brightly though the sheer blue curtains framing the windows in Graceâs room. She opened her eyes and smiled to herself. Last night was beautiful beyond compare. She had never felt that way about anyone. Her heart beat wildly just at the thought of the passionate love she had made with Levi. She loved him, and she wanted more. She sat up and looked out the window. Snow had dusted the outdoors during the wee hours of the morning. Grace could picture herself and Levi running though the snow happily together. She longed desperately for her vision to come true. She needed to see Levi.   She slowly got out of bed and walked to her closet. She ran her hand down the row of clothing hanging there until she found the perfect outfit. Blue jeans and a red sweater, though simple, would look fantastic. 	She slipped the clothes on and with deep, slow sigh, Grace flung open her bedroom door. The living room was completely silent but the faint sound of her brotherâs voice singing. Her parents were probably gone again, so she assumed her brother was practicing.  Riordan was sitting on the couch, playing guitar softly, but he was not singing. The only sound Grace could hear was coming from the boom box in the corner of the room. He was playing the album she and her brother recorded a few years before.  âI thought I burned that.â Grace laughed, reminiscing about that time in her life. Riory and Grace became the way they where together because of that record. It had also changed Riory. It was just before they recorded the collection that he had become a Christian.  Riory looked up and smiled at his sister. âYou though so, but you know Iâm not dumb enough to give you the only copy of anything!â âI should have known.â Riory motioned for Grace to sit down next to him, and she did so promptly.    âHow are you doing?â Grace half felt like smacking him, and half like spilling the beans about her and Leviâs relationship. Levi had never asked her to be his girlfriend, but in Graceâs mind, they where one.    âIâm better.â Grace said, opting not to mention Levi unless Riory brought the subject up. âIâve been having so much funâ¦â âWith Levi, right?â Riory cut Grace off. She smiled. âWith the band! Iâve missed it.â âSo have I.â Riory confessed. âBut not as much fun as I think youâve been having.â   Grace blushed. âYes. I HAVE been having a lot of fun getting to know Levi again. I forgot how much he was to me.â âSo, how serious, then?â âWeâre monogamous.â Grace at least assumed it was monogamous. With Leviâs presumed past, she had no idea. Deep down inside, she believed in Levi. She was his one and only.   âHow is he treating you?â Grace gave her brother a confused look. âHeâs not another Jason if thatâs what you mean. Heâs a sweetheart, Riory!â âIâm well aware of that, but thatâs what Jason was too, at first that is.â  âRiory, thatâs not true!â Grace gave her brother a harsh look. âYou and I agreed before that Jason wasnât the sweetest man alive. Jason openly cheated on me, but Levi, Levi will never leave me. He has given me his solemn vow. I am comfortable talking to him, but I was not with Jason. Levi is on a different planet then Jason.â   Riory rolled his eyes and laughed. âAnd unfortuatly, another planet as us a well.â âYouâre just trying to get me angry, so stop.â Riory smirked at his little sister. It was like yesterday that she was in kindergarten, and he and his girlfriend were babysitting the tyke so that they could go to the ninth grade dance. Now, she was a young woman, with her own life.   âIâm sorry. I canât help it. Youâre my little sister and itâsâ¦â âThe brotherâs job to be critical! Yes!â Grace finished his sentence. Grace came to the realisation many boyfriends ago, that no matter who it was, a minister or a gang member, Riory would always make fun of them because he knew it would get on her nerves. âYeah, you bet youâre sorry!â   Grace sat down next to her brother on the couch. Riordan shrugged. âHow is that new song coming along then, Grace?â Grace smiled. He did know when to stop. âItâs coming along quite well, actually. I think is sucks though.â âItâs about Levi, isnât it?â  Grace did not know if she blushed or if Riory could read her mind. She was in fact writing the song about Levi. âWhy do you think that?â She asked innocently. âI know these things!â   * * * * * * * * *  Levi sat peacefully in his bedroom with his guitar on his lap. His wanted deeply to visit Grace again, but could not. He knew that if she saw him the way he was, his body cut, his face and arms bruised, she would not be able to keep herself together. Levi could not bear to hurt her like that. He promised her he would protect her, and that means from everything, including himself.   Levi opened an unmarked bottle on his nightstand. Oswyn told him that he had used these little pills to relax, and he though he may as well try them out. Deep in thought, he shook the bottle until two pills landed in his hand. They were white and chalky, like aspirin. He took them quickly, and washed them down with a large glass of water.  Levi leaned back and rested his head on a pillow. He could not get the events of the night before out of his head. He just could not believe that the events of the night before we reality. To be in such bliss with the love of his life, then to come home and see such violence. He was still in shock, one, that his brother would actually get married, and two, that could ever act that way towards a woman, even when drunk.   Elaine was still shaken up, but refused to show it. She was her normal self, chatty and working hard in the kitchen. Her emotion strength, and sometimes stubbornness, was one of the qualities Levi and his Dad both admired in her.   When they were young, Ben made it very clear that their father was trying to replace their mother. In some ways, Levi believed his brother, though he never really admitted it. Now, in hindsight, Levi could see that it was not true. Levi had heard the stories about his mother from many different people, but every time he heard the same description, and it was nothing like Elaine.   Anna was her name. She was a tall and thin young woman with blond hair and blue-green eyes like the ocean. She was a shining beauty with a voice like a whispering wind, but was otherwise quiet and spent most of her time alone in her bedroom, singing songs, writing, and painting.   After loosing her brother in a horrible car accident, Leviâs mother was never the same. During the period after, she was chronically ill, depressed, and suicidal. Levi, sadly, could remember her cutting and burning herself while making dinner, and her brother trying desperately to stop her.   The look on Benâs face when he told him that their mother had died was etched forever into Leviâs memory. He was ragged, pale, and he looked cold. Levi could remember the sound of his father sobbing in the other room with wifeâs body.   Levi burst into tears as he thought of these painful memories. He quickly slid his hand beneath his bed and brought forth a blade. He set it on his wrist and prepared to slit a deep gash. He could hear his motherâs voice in his head. His head began to spin in random directions.   âMy boy, sweet boy! Come to your mother, love! Come to me now! Do not worry! I am here! Come to me love!â Levi closed his eyes to keep from becoming sick to his stomach. He gashed himself deeply once, and then laid down the bloody blade on his bed. His ears were ringing.   He opened his eyes and lifted his head from his pillow. In the far corner of his room her could see his motherâs figure. She looked beautiful, but in her hands, she held a handgun. She gave Levi an ironic smile, a wink, pulled the gun to her abdomen, and then pulled the trigger. Levi reeled in pain from the noise of the blast.   âHello, darlingâ¦ Come to your mother, love! Come to me now! Do not worry! I am here! Come to me love!â Levi began to panic. He cried for his mother. âNo! Noâ¦ NO MUM!â He cried out. Suddenly, he felt as if he was on fire. He looked around the room and saw flames licking at his curtains. He tried to scream, but he could not.   He looked at his mother again. Blood gushed from her stomach. She was smiling at him. âCome to your mother, love! Come to me now!â Levi shuttered and turned his head again. Grace was standing there amidst the flames, a frightened look on her face. Levi could hear his motherâs laugh from the other side of the room. He stood and ran toward Grace. She disappeared and was replaced by his mother. She stood before him, grinning. He franticly looked around the room for an escape, but was blocked by flames.   He was startled by a piecing scream. He turned around and saw Grace pinned to his bed, his brother atop her and he was raping her. Graceâs screams of pain and horror shook Levi to the core. Levi tried to run back to the bed, but his legs where like molasses. His mother cackled. âCome!â   Ben looked over at Levi. His eyes pierced painfully into his. Grace screams softened, making Ben and Anna cackle. Jason lifted himself off Graceâs limb body. He was silent as he floated gracefully toward him. Ben reached out to him, making Levi fall to the ground in agony.   Anna reached out to Ben and pulled him close to her breast. Ben smiled, leaned in, and kissed his motherâs lips lustfully. Levi could taste blood and vomit in his mouth. He gagged and looked up at the two figures floating above him. Ben laughed as the two began to change.  Before Levi knew it, he was no longer looking at his mother and brother, but Jenna and Jason. Jason leaned down, his face no farther away then a half an inch. He grinned and placed a fierily hot hand on Leviâs shoulder. Levi tried to pull away, but his grip was like a tourniquet. âYour blood on my hands.â   Jenna and Jason disappeared, leaving Levi in his burning bedroom. He could hear the faint cries of Grace from the far side of the room. He ran toward her, the flames scorching his body. He cried out and flung himself onto the bed. Grace lay naked on his bed covered in blood. Her arms and legs were bound with barbed wire. Levi sobbed and pulled her close to his burned body.   Her body shook in convulsions as a blackish blood dripped from her blue lips. It smelled diseased and metallic, making Levi vomit. Shaking, he whipped his lips and unbound her limbs. Suddenly she stopped shacking, looked up and him, and pulled his face toward her. She kissed him repeatedly.  Leviâs body relaxed. He found himself running his hands over her zombie like body. âLeviâ¦ Stay with meâ¦â Levi pulled Grace closely and together they stripped him of his clothing. Her frozen body began to become warm as she engulfed him.  She smiled at him as she kissed his chest. âMy blood on your handsâ¦â   In a flash that burned Leviâs eyes, both the flames and Grace disappeared. Levi was alone in his room. He weakly collapsed into his bed. His body was overcome with cold and he shook with fright. He could hear the voices of his father and Elaine downstairs, the TV in the living room, music playing in the room below him. âGraâ¦câ¦eeâ  Thank for reading! More coming soon!

      This is SOO hard!  I haven't been writing hardly anything over the past few days. Knotty sheep! (lol)The date of publiscation has been pushed back a while. Quality, not quantity!  The camping trip was FANASTIC, minus the fact I was stupid and fell asleep in the sun with sunblock! Crispyyy... My friends Kevin and Jesse didn't get even a little burnt. I must have gotten their share. I'm not bitter... i swear... *Growls*  This camping adventure has allowed me to get to know my friends a little better, being than some of them are headed off to school. To be a little sappy, I'll miss you guys more than you can imagine. You guys are my big brothers, and I love you! *Hugs*  I'll leave it on that lovey dovey note!  A.H

      Okay! News!   I have made final plans for my first camping trip. I leave tomorrow. *Gulp* I'm a bit nervous, mostly because I'm a total wimp about anything... Natural. Bugs, slugs, and caterpillars. Ewwyyy...  Because I'll be with my buddy, mother nature, as well as some closer friends, (LOL)I won't be able to post anything until later on Sunday night. Hopefully, I will have finished chapter seven, and I will have it up. It's always (and very) possible that I will be distracted to the point of no return on this trip, and won't even touch it. Hey! A little air is good for writer's block... Isn't it? *Goes green*  Even though it looks as if I'm dreading this weekend, in some bizzare way, I'm looking forward to the muck of a lake and the cool winds of an Canadian summer night. (Hey... I like that... :d).   I hope to writer again soon. Lets just hope I make it though. *faints*

      Hello everyone!  I just thought I should update my readers on the progress of "Saving Grace". I had some serious writers block over the last couple days, but I have been able to pull together a little on the seventh chapter. I expect the next three chapters to be posted in the next week or so.  The way I will be posting the chapters is simple, but could become a little confusing to a new reader. For size sake, I have decided to post the story in six chapter increments. Though I may do this, it will be very unlikely I will publish all six of the chapters at the same point in time. To signify I have updated the post, it's title will be altered to include the new chapter(s).  eg. Saving Grace Chapters 7-9 changed to Saving Grace Chapters 7-12  If you have any questions, please leave a message on my comment board, as well as your e-mail address, and I would be glad to answer them for you as well as I can.   A. Hadley

      Dear Friends and Family,  I sure you all know that Iâve completed elementary school. My grade eight commencement took place June 25, 2004, and I am looking forward to attending Forest Heights Institute in the coming fall. At this turning point in my school career, I would like to reflect on those who have affected me most, and show them the respect they deserve. 	 My year at Queensmount Public School as been amazing, and own it to all of you. I have been given incredible opportunities I never imagined Iâd been able to receive, as well as strong support from friends, peers, family, and teachers alike. The first of these opportunities would be the privilege to be moved from seventh to eighth grade. I owe my success in my new grade all to the teachers and staff of Queensmount. Without their hard work and backing, I would have never made it.  	 I would like to recognize a handful of people close to my heart that have influenced me in the past few years. First in foremost, is Jesus Christ, who I find all of my strength. Though I may not have acknowledged it, he had held my hand though the years, leading me to Canada, and eventually my Church, the Fatherâs House. Second, would be my parents. Over the past year especially, I have become closer to my parents than I think I ever have been. I have been able to go father than I ever thought possible because they stood behind me.  	 Over the past few years, many teachers that have entered and left my life and have made a profound impact on my outlook and understanding of myself, my talents, and the world around me. The earliest teacher to impact me in this way was my forth grade teacher, Mr. Tim Wilkinson.  	 It was November 2000, and I was living with my Grandmother in the small town of Stanton, Michigan when I entered Mr. Wilkinsonâs class. During the six months I was in his forth grade class, Mr. Wilkinson showed me that I had value in the community, and, if I tried, would have value in the world. 	 	 In grade six, I had the privilege to be taught by Miss. Nancy Buckland. From the moment I met her, I could tell that she was in teaching not for herself, but for the children. When she entered the room, her joy would lighten the atmosphere, and affected everyone around her in a positive way. She was an advocate for peace, always took the time to talk to her students, and was dedicated to the well-being on those around her. Though her life was tragically cut short on December 19, 2003, her spirit lives on in everyone who knew her. Thank you for generously giving your life for the benefit of those around you.  	 A year later, at Queensmount public school, I would again be affected by caring and dedicated teachers. The first of these would be Mr. Gary Fairmen. Mr. Fairmen is one of the most caring people I have ever met. His skills as a guidance counsellor are unsurpassed. In my case, Mr. Fairmen spent hours of his time listing to me and helping me in any way he could. He was the one who made it possible for me move to grade eight. He specifically asked that I was placed in his home room so that he could continue to help me toward my goals. Though Mr. Fairmen is now leaving Queensmount to retire, we will remember him always. With sincere gratitude, I thank you for all your hard work.   	 In my new grade, I encountered a Mr. Ron House. In the first few months of my new grade, I disliked my new Math and English teacher, and had no problem making it known to him. What intrigued me about him was that my rebellion had no effect on him. I remember him telling the class that he was not going to hound us to take our work more seriously, but he would always be there if we wanted his help. This really caught my attention.  	 From that point on, I worked closely with him, as well as Mr. Burt Snow, to improve my grades, and in the end, gained two fantastic mentors that I will never forget. Thank you for your profound influence in my work, especially writing. I appreciate your interest, and will always remember you. Though both Mr. House and I are moving on (Mr. House is retiring), I hope that we will stay in contact. 	 My eighth grade science teacher, Mr. Kevin Reid, affected me in more subtle way. For the first time in years, Mr. Reid made learning fun for me. He is among the best teachers I have ever had because of his devotion to his students, as well as his ability to make us laugh in the toughest of situations. In his class, I was able to open up and be myself without being worried. Mr. Reid took an interest in his students and went out of his way to make me feel welcome in his class. Thank you for being such a fantastic teacher!  		 Over the past few months, many people outside school have touched my life. My friends have been played a pivotal role in my life. I would like to thank my extended family in the Fatherâs House for supporting me in hardships and struggles. You had faith in me, and though I let you down, you never left my side. Thank you for letting me have the privilege of being a part of your lives.  	 Also, I would like to thank my friends, Jessica Kyle, Mark Urban, Scott Huff, Misha Sgro, and Johnny Oliveira. Though we had a short time together in grade eight, I look forward to strengthening our new relationships. Thank you for being there to cheer me up, to help me see the truth in things, and, in some cases, being there to tell me Iâm off.    	 Though the time has come for me to move on, I will always treasure the lessons you have all taught me. I find it very hard to express my appreciation for all the hard work and time you have put into helping me. Thank you sincerely for your love and support over the past years.    		 			Respectfully yours,   					Amber Hadley

      So...  I had a talk with Fred. I've needed it for about six months now. Now, I have realised how foolish I was to think talking to Fred would be painful. Keeping my feelings bottle up inside of me was far worse.   I felt so relieve to just let my anger and resentment toward him go. How trivial it seems now. I have learned a big lesson. It is always more painful to hide from the truth than it is to submit to it. Now I feel much better. A burden that was not mine to carry has been lifted from my back, and I am free.  Not much going on other than that. Yesterday I decided to get out and do something. Saying home was stifling. I went out to see a a movie with my friend Jessi. The Princess Diaries 2. It was alright. A little to sappy for me. (The Ring was one of my favourites for example!) I had fun anyway.  After the movie (Which Jessi's brother followed us to... the stocker!) The three of us headed to Wendy's to have a late dinner. Very good, other than the fact that the chairs where sticky, the food was soggy, and the fries kepted beeping.   "For God's sake! Take the fries out already!" Jess Kyle  Well, that'll be all... no fries with that...  BAI!

      *Sigh*  It's three AM. I've been thinking to much. After a long chat with my friend, I have realized that I have a lot of things I need to work on and many things I need to be healed from. For my own perposes, I'll leave a list here. Please pray for me!  1- Apathy 2- Anger 3- Jealousy 4- Pride 5- Depression 6- Resentment of my elders 7- Gossip 8- Lying 9- Malcontent 10- Disbelief 11- Lack of Faith 12- Loose tongue 13- Self-demeaning thoughts  In the next few mintutes I will be sending and e-mail that I should have sent a long time ago. Talking to my friend and praying about it made me see that. Thank you Lord for revealing yourself to me tonight.

      The title of this blog is misleading. So misleading it's almost a lie. There is nothing interesting here.  And there is nobody to talk to.  All of my friends have gone, so I sit here and wonder why I'm still alive.  My time is over in their lives And it's time to move on Billy and Bobby both rejected me They're defected soldiers of love  Are blind to the obvious Or am I the one who can't see?

      Okay...  Not much to say right now, but I'm online, so I may as well say SOMETHING. I'm talking to an old friend ;) online. (HEY THERE CHRIS!) and I'm hanging out at my friend A's house. I'm living here for the next week... a little less... I don't remember.  I'm working on saving grace at the same time. The more I write, the more I realise that I am basing my characters on people I know. Hey! If I don't say who they are, it will keep you all guessing!  I'll post more a little later! I've got all day!  ambsy loo

      Howdy!  Despite protests and fanfare, I am home again. (Sorry Len. You can bitch all you want, I don't care.) I enjoyed myself much, but we weren't able to catch many fish.  The first two days were beautiful. Sunny and warm. The water was so still it was almost like glass, so spent most of that time out on the water in my canoe. When I wasn't in the canoe I was fishing off the docks (FLOATING DOCKS ARE EVIL!!!) or coaxing my dog into the swimming hole.  Day number three my parents found a nice pike bed, catching quite a few good sized fish. None worth keeping of course, but better than the three inch pan fish we had been getting.   Days four and five we spent a large amount of our time inside. It was raining on and off, so it wasn't worth paddling out just to be flooded out. The wind was also making it hard to stay in one place. We occupied our time by playing countless games of Amun-Re, Settlers of Catan, and Uno (Uno being the only game I was able to win).  Now the cabin. That is a funny story. It was run down to the point that some of the walls were kept together with duct tape. The floors were so bad that when you got out of bed in the morning, you were forced to stumble down a slop to get to the door (Which was too tall for the doorway... IE, it was always jammed).   Because of coding, the owner was not allowed to build walls that went floor to ceiling so the wood-paneled walls where about a foot shorter than they should have been. The bathroom shower rocked when you took a shower, the furniture was cira 1955, and the water was straight from the lake.   This made for an interesting week. Even so, I enjoyed it much. With so little space separating myself and the other family members, I was able to get to known them better, especially Kyle, my sister's boyfriend. We talked about a lot of different things, witnessed a bird-window collision (The front cabin window), and learned was happens when one eats a hot pepper and cheese bagel.    I better go!  Ciao!  ambler

      Hello everybody.  I have just gotten news that my friend Misha's uncle Tom has just passed away in Kolona B.C. Tom was her only uncle and she is very shaken by his death. Please pray for her, the Lauzon and Sgro families.  In other news, I leave tomorrow for the cabin. I am a little stressed with all of the prep it takes, but I'm sure it will all be fine once we get to the lake. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the weather while there's still time, for Fall is upon  us. And we all know what that means for me...  Well, it's time for me to start packing. For those of you I missed saying goodbye to on Wednsday:  GOODBYE!

      Bubble gum flavoured soda...  I never would have thought it would be so good. Before, I was like, "Eww.. Bubblegum?" Now I love the stuff. Itâs actually quite interesting how many different flavoured carbonated beverages you can buy these days. It almost makes your head spin. Like blue Pepsi and diet vanilla coke. I've even had a celery flavoured bubbly from Mexico(Not recommended)!  *Yawn*

      Ahhh!  It's really nice to be awake for a change. Speaking of change, over the past 24 hours there has been a huge change in me. God really touched me on Sunday. He changed my view of the people around me and he reached out to me like never before. For the first time in a LONG time, I was ALMOST speachless. I feel great, I'm rested (In the lord :D ), and my drive for writing has returned. I pray that I will be able to sustain this... I never what to let this feeling go!  I am begining to look forward to the family vacation. It will be quite the test for me. I need to work on my short fuse, and this may be my chance. It's horrible being around me sometimes, I'm sure. For all of you that I have flipped out on, I am really sorry. Pray for me!  Today I contacted an old friend of mine in the States. I haven't heard from her since the first of the year. She was also a christian, so I felt compelled to tell her what happened on Sunday. When she picked up the phone, I hardly reconized her. Her voice was haggard and she sounded as if she was depressed. I asked her what was wrong.  Apparently, she is no longer a believer. She, like me, was burned by the church, and had run away from it all. She told me of her saturday nights partying with people twice her age, getting drunk, and a violent fight she had with her father.    After I finished my call, I felt as if I was going to faint. Hearing my friend, who walked me though my troubled times when I lived in the states, ask me to get drunk with her the next time I saw her, scared me, but also made me feel very privilaged. It made me realise that I am very lucky to be where I am today. If it were't for God's Grace leading me to the Father's House, I wouldn't be hear.  So, I send out a prayor request for my friend. Her name is Treva. Pray for her, that she will be safe and that God will reveil herself to her.   Also, my mother is having test done tomorrow on her kidney. Pray that I all is well.  Thanks,  Amber

      Well,   I'm very tired, but I'm alive. It's hot in my office, so I am wearing the bare minimum of required clothing (To be considered decent). I have two HUGE fans blowing on my now, but they don't seem to be very helpful.  I have just been spending time with God. I need to rejoin my church. I have HARDLY been going, and it's really effecting me. After yesterday, I realised that. Now, I just need to talk to my pastor about it. I help to get myself to church. I need prayor.  Hopefully, in a few mintues, I will be leaving to go see a movie with Jessi. What exactly we will be seeing is still in debate, but we know we want to see a movie. Why not? It's free!  I better split!  amber

      You walk into an seemingly empty room. Your head pounds as you look around. All seems quiet. You take a few paces forward, spot a friend, stop and wave hello. He smiles and waves back. Maybe he's glad to see you, but are glad to see him?  A cloud comes over you. You feel like turning back.  But...  You tell yourself not to back down. You know this is where you need to be. There is a lot fo work to be done. Coffee, cream, sugar; you take a sip. Bang bang... Your head spins.   It's the pastor's wife. She's coming right towards you. Your hands clam up. A lump creeps up in the back of your throat.  Shake shake, yawn, you smile, hoping she will ignore you.  "Want to sing today?" Her only words. You freeze. Not at all what you expected. You nod in shock and she motions you to follow her. Can you really go though with it?  You wait next to the soundboard and hum softly to yourself. "Testing: 1, 2, 3!" Goosebumps cover your body. You can't believe your doing this. You want to run and hide. Your head spins in every direction and you're stomach turns.   "Don't worry!" You hear a voice tell you from behind. You look around, but nobody's there. "Shake shake." You try to losen up. You hear the voice again.   "I am here."   The voice is clear as day. You take a deep breath and continue over to the band.   You begin to sing with the pastor's wife. You try and give it your best, but nothing seems to be going well. About now your head feels like it's going to explode. The screaching of the microphones makes you feel as if you are going to die. You cringe. "Don't worry, I am here."  You hear the voice again. "What is this?" you ask yourself. You can't figure out where it is coming from. People are bustling around you, but they look as if they are in slow motion. You head stops hurting. "Don't worry, I am here."  After the practice you go into the kitchen to be alone. You look around the room frantically. "This isn't happening. Not to you." You say to yourself. You never thought it would. "Could this voice be the voice of God?" you ask yourself.   "Lord... Help me." You pray sceptically. A shiver runs down your spine. You begin to pray louder. Your voice becomes stronger and stronger with every word you speak. With your prayer, the voice becomes more clear.  You hear the voices of people arriving. "Lord, help me do your will. Help me walk in your ways!" You leave the kitchen praying quietly to yourself. It will soon be time to sing.  "God, help me give my all to you today."  You approch the microphone and grasp it firmly in your hand. An incredible peace floods over you. Tears build in your eyes. You are content. You close your eyes and smile to yourself.  "Father in heaven! Blessed is your holy name! Great is the God of Heaven and Earth."
