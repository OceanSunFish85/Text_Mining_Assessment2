      âI am confusedâ 	Yan ang mga salitang sinabi niya sa classmate ko nung nag-usap sila tungkol sa akin. Confused? Bakit? Kasi may nililigawan na siyang iba at heto na naman ako at ginugulo ulit ang buhay niya? O dahil hindi niya alam kung paano mag-rereact sa mga sudden appearances ko ulit sa tahimik na niyang buhay? Well, wala siya magagawa kasiâ¦ mahal ko siya, sorry na lang siya. 	Nagsimula ang lahat nung first year kami high school kami. Sabi niya sa classmate ko crush niya ako, pero takot ako sa kanya kasi, WE ARE WORLDS APART. Ang mundo ko ay tungkol sa competition for honors, matalino ako at nagsisimula ng sumikat. Siya, isa syang ordinaryong student, pero may isang bagay na kakaiba sa kanya, BARUMBADO siya at pala-away. Kaya naman takot na takot akong maloko niya. Kahit cute siya, iniwasan ko siya. At siguro, nanawa na rin siya, pinabayaan niya na din ako. 	 Nung second year kami, ngumiti siya sa akin at dun nagsimulang magunaw ang mundo ko. Grabe, ang cute niya pala pagngumimgiti! Bakit ko ba siya pinakawalan? Kasi sabi ko hindi kami bagayâ¦ dahil sira-ulo siya. Pero napatunayan niya na hindi siya irresponsible dahil naging president siya ng class nila. Pero kasabay nang pagbabago niya ay ang pagtaas lalo ng tingin ng mundo sa akin dahil naging first honor ako for just one grading.  Kahit magkaiba kami mas nagkalayo ang aming mundo, gusto ko pa din siya, gustung-gusto. At malaon, minahal ko na siya, kasoâ¦ wala na ang dating paghanga niya sa akinâ¦ for short wala na siyang gusto sa akin. Hay buhay! 	 Third year- nawalan na siya ng pakialam sa akin. Kahit ilang beses ako magpapansin sa kanya walang epekto dahil may iba na siya. Kahit ganun, wala sa vocabulary ko ang sumuko! Hindi ko siya isusuko kahit napakadami niyang naging girlfriend. Ilang beses din akong nagmukhang tanga sa kakasunod sa kanya at kaaasa na magiging kami. Ilang lalaki din ang binasted ko dahil sa kanya. Pero anong ginawa niya, walaâ¦ kasi ako din naman ang nang-iwan. Lalo lang ako na-inlove sa kanya nung naging varsity siya. Tumaas ang tingin ng tao sa kanya pero hindi pa rin karapat-dapat para sa akin na consistent honor student at hinirang na isa sa mga best writers ng school namin. Sandaang dipa na naman ang pagkakalayo namin. Naalala ko pag sinasabi ko sa iba na crush ko siya. Hindi sila magsasalita at sasabihin na lang na âBakit yun? Hindi kayo bagay noh! Maghanap ka na lang ng iba!â Pati mga kabarkada ko hindi maintindihan kung bakit siya. Masakit pero pinaglaban ko siya kahit hindi niya alam na pinaglalaban ko siya. Susuko na sana ako pero tinatagan ko lang ang loob ko dahil mahal na mahal ko siya.  	Tapos ngayong fourth year nabuhayan ako ng loob. Katabi ko yung classmate ko na naglapit sa amin nung first year. Unti-unti, nalaman ko na may pakealam pa rin pala siya sa akin, kahit konti. Kinukumusta niya ako kung okay lang ba daw ako. Araw-araw akong pinapasok ng classmate ko sa mag pag-uusap nila. At syempre kinikilig naman ako pag may magagandang sinisabi siya tungkol sa akin. Lagi ko na nga sinasabi sa sarili ko na âHeto na, magiging boyfriend ko na siyaâ  Pero sabi nga nila, though you want some things badly, you might end up not having them. Confused siya dahil nung mga panahong pumapasok ulit ako sa buhay niya ay may nililigawan na siyang iba. Ano bang magagawa ko eh sa mahal ko siya? Pero natapos din yung confusion na yun.  	Hindi niya ako piniliâ¦ mas pinili niya yung babaeng kabaliktaran ko. Hindi gaano katalinuhan pero pinakita niya talagang mahal niya ang lalaking mahal ko din. At isa lang ang dahilang pumasok sa utak ko nang hindi niya ako pinili. Ang dahilan kung bakit hindi ko siya pinansin dati. Dahil magkalayo ang mundo naming ginagalawan. Wala pinagbago ang mga pangyayari. At heto na naman ako, nag-iisa. Walang kahit na sinong kadamay, kasi sa loob ng apat na taon, siya lang talaga ang taong pinaglaanan ko ng oras. Masakit talagaâ¦ bakit ganun? Bakit ba kailangang paghiwalayin kami ng mundo? Bakit ba kailangang maging tanga sa pag-ibig ang mga tulad naming matatalino? Tinatanong ako ng mga tao âBakit mo ba siya mahal na mahal? Wala naman siyang ginawa sa âyo na kainlove-inlove!â. Ewan ko nga, talaga nga sigurong tanga lang ako. Pero kahit ganun nasasaktan ako dahil ang bagay na naglayo sa amin ay ang bagay na pinaka-ingat-ingatan ko. Kahit na, di ba pwede naman niya ako ipaglaban? Di ba pwede naman paglapitin ang dalawang mundo? Bakit hindi niya nagawa? Kaya naman niya akong mahalin kahit iba ako para sa mundo di ba? O dahil ba hindi ko pinakita sa kanya noon pa na gusto ko din siya dahil sa pride ko? Kung pinakita ko ba sa kanya na mahal ko siya, may pagbabagong nangyari or pagtitripan nya lang ako magtatake advantage siya dahil alam ng mundo na minsan lang ako magkacrush? At higit sa lahatâ¦   Bakit kahit ilang beses niya ako saktan ay mahal ko pa din siya?  Bakit ba kailangang ganito ang turing sa akin ng mundo? Ilang tanong na kahit kailan ay hindi ko maihahanap ng kasagutan at napakasakit nitoâ¦ sana lang malaman ko na ang sagot. 	Heto ako, walang patutunguhan dahil siya lang ang laman ng isip ko.

      I hate Valentines!!!! It reminds me of how lonely my life isâ¦ it reminds me of how life is so unfairâ¦ it reminds me of that longing feeling of having at least one person treat me like a princess on that dayâ¦ it reminds me of the things I wished for in my dreamsâ¦ it reminds me of loveâ¦ it reminds me of sweetness and those cute couplesâ¦ it reminds me of the thing I can never haveâ¦ but most significantly, Valentines reminds me of the one person I canât haveâ¦ YOU!!!!  I see you and I see my dream guyâ¦ I see you and I see the world I moved in for the past four years of my lifeâ¦ I see you and though it sounds corny, my heart skips a beatâ¦ I see you and I feel a thousand spears pierce through my heartâ¦ I see you and I want to touch you so badly especially if you are just inches away from meâ¦ I see you and I yearn to be the one at your side laughing and joking with youâ¦ I see you and I feel a slap on my face that brings me back to reality that even if you are my dream guy, you will forever remain a dreamâ¦ a dream that will never come trueâ¦ YOU!!!!!!  And now, Valentines is just around the corner and I will despise once again every minute of it. I will despise every time you smile at me on that day because that will be the only thing you can give me, neither roses nor chocolates, just a smileâ¦ I will despise every moment you will come near me and pair me with your other friends because I want you to know that I do not like them, I like youâ¦ I will despise every single instant that you will respond jokingly to every question that I will ask you because for once I want you to take me seriouslyâ¦ I despise every single chance that you will get to tell me to slap hands with you and make me look like a complete joke because I will blush furiouslyâ¦ I despise every single time that you will stare at me as if I am saying something witty though I am just plainly conversing because I donât want you to see me as an unreachable person, I want you to see me as meâ¦ and more importantly I will despise every split second of Valentines Day especially when I see you with her, holding hands and giving her all the love and care, I feel bad coz those are the things I wantâ¦ ONLY FROM YOU!!!!!  On that day I will envy her. I will envy her because she would be smiling so happily because this day would be special for herâ¦ I will envy her because she would receive lots of love and giftsâ¦ I will envy her because she could sing songs of love while I could only whisper and squeal the lyrics of that songâ¦ I will envy her because you would not look at her differently but instead as a real personâ¦ and I will envy her because she has YOU!!!!!  I hate Valentines Day. I hate it so much that I want that after February 13 would be 15 instead of 14. But hey, who am I to change the course of time? I am just this crazy gal who wants eagerly the love of her life. I want to be with you on this dayâ¦ I want you to treat me like a princess on that dayâ¦ I want you to see deeper into me and not just lookâ¦I want you to give me your sweetest smiles and heartfelt laughâ¦ I want you to pay even an ounce of attention to me, not just when you are going to tease me or I am going to ask you somethingâ¦ I want to feel that you care for meâ¦I want you to â¦ I want you to stay beside meâ¦ even if just for todayâ¦.  But like they say, want is different from needâ¦ but if I have to restate all my wants into needsâ¦ I would tirelessly and willingly do soâ¦ I just want you to know that I would do everything just so I can feel you love meâ¦ I donât want your loveâ¦ I NEED IT!! So badlyâ¦ even if just for this dayâ¦ I need YOU!!!!   Valentines- I know that this request would never reach youâ¦ I will never have the strength to tell anyone how I feel for youâ¦ I will never have the courage to tell you face to face that I love youâ¦ I will never ever tell you how much you mean to meâ¦ I will never ever be good enough for youâ¦ I will never ever let out all pain and love I feel insideâ¦ all I can do is watch you from a distant and say I will never ever forget you and all the love I feel for youâ¦ and now all I can do is put this in mindâ¦ Valentines is sharing the love you have and understanding the love I lostâ¦ and that isâ¦ YOU!!!!

      This song is sung by one of my most favorite rock bands and âhisâ favorite too, Linkin Park. Itâs about breaking away from something that you have been loving obsessing about because it hurts you so much, resistance is futile and no matter how much you say that you can fight for it, you no longer can.   When I took a quiz on the net, the results said that this song is for the one I love, or letâs call him my ex-ai. Itâs also a coincidence that this band is also my ex-aiâs favorite. I find this song appropriate because the band clearly expressed the pain and confusion when you have to let go of something you found to be part of your âdaily doseâ, when you have to âbreak away from the habitâ.  I am not a drug addict, but the way I have been obsessing about my ex-ai is like a woman hooked on marijuana and heroine since her childhood years.  Iâm not exaggerating, I guess itâs just like that when youâre in love with someone who treats you like another stranger in their lifeâ¦ you keep on being rejected, the stronger is the surge to get him. At first, it was just your normal dose then as days go by, the drive increases until it becomes a habit which eventually turns into addiction. Of course it hurts to have all my love be fixated exclusively for one person only, but who cares? Even if Iâm being called brainless despite my high IQ, I really donât careâ¦ the only thing I care about is I see my ex-ai and talk to him, which I always thought would turn out be something more serious than that.        Memories consume Like opening the wounds Iâm picking me apart again You all assume Iâm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  The first stanza, oh yesâ¦ itâs all about the memories and the pain and the faÃ§ade. The whole entourage is here. I tried to forget him, really I did. I have collected all the things I have which remind me of him and ask my best friend to keep it. I have written him a six-page long letter on how I fell for him, love him and eventually hate myself for loving him, but that letter was just kept in my drawer, and I always read it thatâs why memories always come back to haunt me. Whenever I see him it all comes back, the times when he tried to make friends with me, when my friend told me that he liked me when I was still a freshman in high school, when he smiles at me and when he fools around with me. All these memories and so much more are just ripping me apart into pieces. It hurts me so much just to think about him. I tell my friends that I donât care a bit about him but the truth us just I put on a brave face so that they wonât know how foolish I am when it comes to love. They all think that I have moved on because I am now diverting my attention to other guys, but the truth isâ¦ itâs all just an act. When Iâm alone though you think Iâm alright, Iâll never be alright.             I donât want to be the one The battles always choose Cause inside I realize That Iâm the one confused  Now we have the refrain, yes I am confused. I donât know how the heck I got myself in this position but Iâm here so thereâs no turning back. At this point, though I am going into another phase in my life, I canât seem to let go of that past which clings tightly unto me, but a part of me says that I have to, for my own good.  I feel so torn between the mixed feelings I have. Itâs driving me crazy up to the point I donât know if Iâm doing the right thing. I donât want to be put in this kind of situation but it is fate that chose that I have to deal with this and while Iâm at it, fate decided to give me a taste of hell.   Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more that anytime before I have no options left again  Before I proceed to the chorus, letâs go to the second line first. I have a cure, or at least a temporary one. Itâs redirecting my attention to other guys who I see, which end up being temporary diversion only. But the more I try to deny all the feelings I have inside and the more I try to use my cure, the greater is the pain. I just end up comparing the guys I meet to him and I just give any guy who comes near me a nil chance which seems really unfair.  And now I am stuck with no alternative, I canât cure it. But I realized something that the reason I canât cure it is because I am afraid of losing him in my heart. The pain became a part of me that I no longer can let go of it. Itâs like the pain is what I live for and it shadows all the sense left in me. It sounds weird but now I realize it.  I donât know whatâs worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? I donât know why I instigate, And say what I donât mean I donât know how I got this way I know itâs not alright So, Iâm breaking the habit Iâm breaking the habit Tonightâ¦  The chorus, the most hard-hitting words in the song are here. Yes, I have no idea what I am fighting for, if it is the love I feel or the obsession to experience the feeling of having someone love me which I lost in him. I donât know why I want to hurt to myself for one person who does not know me deeply. I donât know why I keep on doing this to myself. Maybe because the feeling of regret and pain clouded my sanity to the point that I donât know what to do with all the emotions I feel. I donât know why I say some things that I know in my heart I donât mean. Like when I say that I am okay when I am not, when I said that I donât like him when I do. Thatâs when I realized that these feelings cannot be denied because the more I do that the harder it is for me to overcome all the pain. There is no other way that to face the worst pain I ever encountered so far and while Iâm facing it, I have to let go of the source of the pain though I find myself at a certain point that its hard to break away from the habit, the habit of seeing and having mixed emotions when I see him, reality came crashing down that I just need to say adios to the habit of himâ¦       Iâll paint it on the walls Coz Iâm the one at fault Iâll never fight again And this is how it ends  	Yes, as sang by Linkin Park at the Coda, I am the one at fault. These things would never have happened if only I had been more careful about the feelings I give to others. These things would never have occurred if only I had not fought the feelings I suppressed when he used to like me. I would never have to go through all these if only I had been more open-minded to the things that could possibly be. I would never have to stick to the feeling of pain if only I had to learn to let go of it beforehand. And most of all, I would have never written this if only I had decided to break away from him before he became someone that I would find myself hard to live without though he only causes me pain. All these could have been avoided if only I stopped myself from hurting my feelings and stopped liking and loving him completely. So, yes, it is my fault and I am trying my best to make up for that mistake.     I donât know whatâs worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I donât know how I got this way Iâll never be alright So, Iâm breaking the habit Iâm breaking the habit Tonight    	This is the last chorus, the last few lines in the song. I am trying to break away from the habit, though itâs hard to do, I am doing my best and I hope it is good enough. I can never be TOTALLY ALRIGHT because he has inflicted serious wounds here in my heart. But I realized that I canât exactly dwell on these feelings forever because itâs not healthy for me or the people around me. I canât let people wait for me to be completely happy because for the longest time they had exerted effort for me to be close to him or give me chances, but I guess I and my ex-ai will never beâ¦ our fates are not intertwined with each other. But who knows?  Maybe in the future we will meet again and maybe when we see each other he will no longer be a habit, but just a memory that I can live without. But I know, deep inside my heart he will always and forever be a part of me that I never can completely let go of.
