						   Presently the nails on my left hand are painted purple. The right has pink. My thumbs have an extra coat of glitter.  It's my birthday!!!  I received from my parents the Special Edition Labyrinth DVD. It came with a really cute little booklet, a scene composite of Sarah with the Fireys, and a goblin sketch card. The only additions to the DVD was a mega-photogallery. This is my favorite movie - DEAL WITH IT!  My sisters just handed me a Build-A-Bear - they named it Sally Doobie - It's a name I made up when I was...maybe...three? (From Mary Jodie and Gwanana Took, my sisters other names.) They also purchased the Hawaiian outfit, to satisfy my Tiki obsession... and a faerie dress! It was a World Wildlife Fund Lion. Technically it was a Build-A-Lion? Anyway a $1.oo went to the WWF. This makes me very happy.  Ryan and my brother apparently went in on a gift together - and it's in the mail. I'm curious by nature. Hummmmmm........did I mention it was my birthday???!!!

						   Yesterday I got to see my good friend Christian, he's a good kid - he's got a good grasp on life, sometimes I think not his own but in general he's definitely a sweet kid. He lives far far away...  My two best friends in high school, whom I've kept really close contact and whom I absolutely love ~ live all the way in Chicago... (Hi Akiba! Hi Heather!)  Jeremy moved away with Christian. None of my other friends here live closer than 45min. away... even my ex lives a freak'n hour away...   All this traveling... gas prices are going upupupupup......I don't have a car - not that I'm allowed to drive. Oi!

						   Do you know what a port is? (This blog is turning into a medical journal...gross...) They put a tube in your chest so it's easier to get medication and take blood. They also wanna give me one of those things...  They'll take me kicking and screaming....

						   Most people donât know what they have.  Today I went to the doctor for yet another blood test, a cbc if you know what that is. Apparently my platelet count is dropping. What do platelets do? Basically they are for clotting. If you get a cut they are why you stop bleeding â Iâm on a blood thinner. Should something happen, the bleeding wouldnât stop. Since only vampires find this attractive, Iâve been in the hospital every day since my birthday. Yes, I spent my birthday in the hospital â Iâve spent my birthday in the hospital for years runningâ¦ Iâve lost count and Iâm only 24.  Today I went to the doctor for yet another blood test. What I did get was a bone/marrow biopsyâ¦and some other bone marrow thing I canât pronounce. They stuck a needle in my back (not the first time this has happened, Iâve had a spinal tap and other various tests of this nature.) It didnât really hurt that much, it tickled a lot actually â your suppose to keep still for these types of things and I was squiggling aroundâ¦ I did cry though. It was one of those âwhy do these things keep happening to meâ cries.  Yesterday I heard someone say people who have cancer are lucky, because of the attention they get and the help people give them â things of that nature. I see people around me complaining about the stupidest shit â a bad hair day, or the store was out of there favorite ice cream. Now, Iâm not saying that my problems are worse than anyone elseâs, cause they arenât, but to me I feel like screaming â Pick Your Battles! I have a few friends that hate it when I say this butâ¦  It could be worse.  Most people donât know what they have.  Is it so wrong to ask people to look around and maybe appreciate whatâs there? I wasnât able to walk for a long time, now I take my dog out and play with her because I CAN! I find it utterly amazing ~ while people just label me loony. Walking, jumping, dancing, Iâd like to add roller skating to my list of my long lost arts but I havenât found a pair or roller skatesâ¦NOT BLADES!!! Hell â for me being able to leave my house THE long lost art. I have to wait till the doctors give the say so â It wasnât so bad when couldnât get up but now that I can walk again Iâm ready to walk right OUT!!! ARG!!! I can stand outside and look at the stars. I can walk down the road and buy a big gulp at 7-eleven. Iâve been dancingâ¦when no one is around. *^_^* Great, Iâm the damn Little Mermaidâ¦  I just know we have so much and we never stop to look at it, love it, recognize the value in thingsâ¦ in peopleâ¦

						   Father's Day - My poor dad, all he wanted to do was sleep. Instead he got to drive my mother and I to the hospital so I could get platelets, then my mom wanted to go to Jo-Ann Fabrics, then she wanted to eat at Shells. He worships that woman.  So - I've been 24 for at least 24 hours. I feel it. Granted I'm certainly not ready to pack up my Legos, and I will never stop playing with my dolls (I adore miniature tea sets!) But... I don't want to play with my obsessions within the confines of my parents home. It's a little harder for me right now cus' I just had a freaking stem-cell transplant but I really can't wait to leave.  On a lighter note I'm planning to sew Samantha (my american girl doll) a Dorothy costume. My new Lion Build-a-Bear? is going to be the Cowardly Lion, and seeing as my sisters also have Build-A-Misc. Animal...Zander (an actual bear) will be the Tin Man. And Greg the Bunny will portray the Scarecrow. All will have costumes.

						   I just got back from Chicago for my three month 'check up' after my stem cell transplant. I look like a heroin addict.   Hello Officer...no I'm not on drugs, well only prescribed ones...I'm sorry I'm not trying to be cheeky... it's the truth I swear...  Ignore the black and blue track marks!  AND WHOA~!!! I saw some pictures of myself just before I left for Chicago to get that treatment, GOODNESS ~ !  I looked absolutely horrific! I was damn scary, at least I look better now - not much but I'm working on it. I was 200lbs when I left and last time at the doc's I was 164 - I'm happy cause I need new pants!!! My face is so much smaller - I saw that picture and on the one hand I was terrified by the way I looked and on the other hand I was soooo glad I don't look that way now!  I have bruises up and down my arm and some nice big ones on my hands... a little less than a year and I'll be done with all this mumbo jumbo. I can't *ucking WAIT! I stopped take'n a lot'o'pills.     Lovely.

						   ... you think you knonw some people...  Anyway!  I'm not much of a music buff. I rely on my friends to introduce me to anything new I might like. When they do introduce me to new and exciting things - all those wonderful lyrics seem to fit in my life, state of mind, dreams. I just got the new Cure Album entitled 'The Cure.' I hate it when bands title the CD after the band name...  (Robert Smith I forgive you - but only cause I love you.)  They don't just write depressing songs by the way. And Lovesong makes me melt every time - I always have that romantic notion He'll lullaby me to sleep with that song. (I'm talking about my dream lover by the way and it's not who your thinking. I think I'm just about done with him.)  I listened to the new album only once so far. It basicly sounds like their other stuff. Everyone tells me all Cure songs sound the same - Trust me... I don't care... they don't sound the same to me. There seem to be a lot of goodbyes in this CD. Some rude awakenings, mournfull lyrics, and it's been fun. I just broke up with my boy toy of four years. It's hard for me - I remember what being lonely was! Every song on the radio seems to pertain to me. As does this compact disk that my favorite band wrote for me. I like Poe. I wish she'd come out with a new album.  July 25 the Cure will be in Tampa and I couldn't find anyone to go with me. That's a week after Elise's birthday! (They have a song to Elise, lucky girl!) I wanted to go....REALLY BAD.... or at least find someone who was going, I could have at least gotten a T. Oh well right?  *sigh*

						   I think it's very important to surround yourself with good people. Talent, humor, poetry, and beauty... that sums up all my friends...  I've recently met some new people, remet others... good times.  Everyone seems to be wonderfulness ~ *^_^*  Even with all this friendship - I can't find a bloody person to go to the Cure concert with me...ARG!  I'm going to write to Angelina Jolie. She'll go with me. Maybe she'll pay!!! My sister can babysit her rugrat.  I miss my friends, I've been stuck in this fake house. *GROWL* I'm lonely. I realize I don't like crowds, but this is ridiculous...'one is the lonelyest number...' (I knew that song before it was in Magnolia... SO THERE!  I have nothing to do. I have everything to do.  ...distress...

						   Itâs funny how life works. The outside of my journal has a marigold and gold very stylized sun on either cover. I decided to write out lyrics that have to do with the sun on all the rays protruding from itâs face. See if you know who sings some of theseâ¦ 1.	SUNNY DAYS chasing the clouds awayâ¦ 2.	IM GOâNA SOKE UP THE SUN GOâNA TELL EVERYONE TO LIGHTEN UPâ¦ 3.	I TRY TO LOOK UP TO THE SUN BUT MY EYES BURNâ¦ 4.	SUNNY, YESTERDAY MY LIFE WAS FILLED WITH RAIN 5.	LET THE SUNSHINE, LET THE SUN SHINE INâ¦ 6.	IâLL SURF TILL THE SUN SETS BEYOND THE HORIZONâ¦ 7.	COME TASTE THE SUNSWEET BERRIES OF THE EARTH 8.	I AM THE SON  THE HEIR/ I AM THE SUN  THE AIR 9.	ON AN ISLAND IN THE SUN WE CAN PLAY AND HAVE SOME FUN 10.	FROM THE DAY WE ARRIVE ON THE PLANET AND BLINKING STEP INTO THE SUNâ¦ 11.	YOUâRE THE ONE YOUâRE THE SUNSHINE 12.	MIGHT AS WELL BE WALKING ON THE SUN 13.	BLACK HOLE SUN wontâcha come 14.	GOOD DAY SUNSHINEâ¦. 15.	HERE COMES THE SUNâ¦ 16.	YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFEâ¦ 17.	YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE MY ONLY SUNSHINE 18.	SUNSHINE ON MY SHOULDER MAKES ME HAPPYâ¦ 19.	IâM WALKING ON SUNSHINEâ¦ 20.	SUNSHINE, LOLLYPOPS  RAINBOWSâ¦ I gave my little sun on the front cover the makeup of Death, the neil gainman comic book character, on the back cover Peter, of Kiss. When my sisters and I dressed up as Kiss for Halloween heâs the one I dressed up as. In the inside cover there are three more sunsâ¦ they will get to be the other member of Kiss. (You know I just love to get off topic.)  N.E.Wayâ¦â¦. I was asking anyone who walked past me for songs that had to do with the sun, the above playlist being what was come up with. One of my favorite Cure songs is called Mint Carâ¦   	âthe sun is up Iâm so happy I could scream!â It  would  have the word âsunâ in the very first lineâ¦ 	âand thereâs nowhere else in the world iâd rather beâ I almost shot myselfâ¦ 	âthan here with you itâs perfect, itâs all I ever wanted *oh*â How could I have forgotten? 	âi almost canât believe that itâs for realâ You can say that againâ¦ 	âso kiss me quick *ah*â BRILLANCE HAS STRUCK! BLESS THAT ROBERT SMITH! (He married his high school sweet heart you know!) Two wonderful thing happened â I got a title for my journal (Mint Car, to be written on the spine.) And something for the first page â I have this lovely habit of never putting anything on the first blank page of my journals because nothing ever seems to be important enough â nothing ever fits just quite right. When I get a new journal itâs hard enough to taint the lovely new pages with my crap! The first pageâ¦ nothing everâ¦. NADA! Excuse me I have to go dance around a bit brbâ¦.  â¦betterâ¦ okay so on the first page Iâm going to put the lyrics to Mint Carâ¦ the title is so marvelously off in left field, and the lyrics are so brilliantly sunny and lovely.   VOILA!

						      This is another one of by kittens, Laia - Like the Princess from the Star Wars movies.    This is Godzilla. She's the smallest mammal we own. (Or maybe she owns us!)    I dislike stuffed animals, I find they are a lot like crack. The only two I have found I can tolerate are my build-a-bear/lion and one I have of Jack Skellington's dog, Zero. Here's my lion with her faerie dress on and my doggie Mapo.

						   â¦problems. The world is full of pointless problems, terribly important to whoever â virtually nonexistent to everyone else. My current crisis as such isâ¦ I like to blog. I love to blog. (What the hell kind of a word is blog?) Iâm on the computer typing away frequently. Iâm not the best writer â but thatâs not really what itâs about is it? What do you do, show off in front of your friends? Try to tone down the truth so no one takes offence? Bullshit?  I am *so* not saying that is wrong.  Who reads blogs anyway? Who cares?! Eeeehâ¦â¦. Iâm just a little mad right nowâ¦cause of that problem. I kinda need the computer to blog and my mother doesnât want me on the computer anymore. Apparently I have the computer all dayâ¦ thatâs her problem. She canât say I donât let anyone else use the computer because the truth is if anyone wants it I have no difficulty handing the computer (itâs a new nice laptop!) to whom ever wants to play with the new toyâ¦just gimme a couple minutes to let me save whatever Iâm doing and itâs yours. So right here and now people â I am saving up all my pennies for a laptop ~ Maybe Iâll paint it pinkâ¦ red? *Natasha* needs her own computer keysâ¦  Speaking of blogs â I have a blog. Also have a journal. I love my blog â I love to rant but all my real stuff goes into the journal. I have letters Iâve never sent tucked in the pagesâ¦ some of the best writing Iâll ever do I think â but Iâll never send those letters. I donât let people read my journal either.   I used to think I needed lines. All my other journals, sinceâ¦ oh my goodnessâ¦ since the second grade? maybe? It was poems and stories and songs â doodles, lots of doodles. It was really thick inch and a half? It had bright blue binding and cornerâ¦thingsâ¦ it was an Asian jacquard print â I thought it was gorgeous and I still have it somewhereâ¦â¦ anyway, it has lines *blue ones.* My favorite kind of journal was the composition notebook (it has lines) â I think my favorite ever ~ I decorated the outside of this comp. book (I hated the cowâwannabe thing.) with black electrical tape â very straight lined â across the front and back cover. This was my freshman year in high school. That was certainly a year of changeâ¦ then sophomore year *Natasha* was QUEEN of the Iâm going to skip school people. In Chicago Iâd skip and go to libraries and museums and zoosâ¦. hereâ¦ thereâs nothing to do! My second sophomore year I got freakân straight Aâsâ¦.sad state of affairs. That was also when I got diagnosed with lupus, put on an obscene amount of prednisone, move to a new state, cut off from the whole damn worldâ¦ oiâ¦ when I met Ryan I sort of stopped journaling â cause of college â I still wrote, but I focused on other creative pursuitsâ¦but no crystallized language my friends. I started up again after I got sick this last time, with a journal without lines. I feel like I've been born again. Mypages are half full, I want to start shopping forsome new ones.No lines......  I told someone, Iâm pretty sure it was Christian, that if I got a blog Iâd be forced to put all these emotional entries. I couldnât just skim the surface, Iâd be just too damn âopen.â  âAt this moment this is me at my most masochisticâ¦â but I have to admit, all my really juicy thought processes are kept in my journal. Today I was actually going to share some of that â a letter â strike that ~ an epic poem to Ryan. I didnât because I was feeling when I wrote it, and with the last word feeling was gone. Now the importance, urgency, and fervor are over.  The last word was cinder.  A phoenix rises up out of ashes.    Earlier today, my sister and I were driving â she had the radio on â Iâm an adamant believer in whoever is driving gets to pick the music. Veruca Salt, Seatherâ¦..(sp?) was playing. Then â some weird jamaican music started playing. I asked the heavens to please make this a good songâ¦âwhenever iâm alone with you, you make me feel like I am home againâ Granted it was not the Cure singing it â but this is the worlds greatest love song. The cover band didnât sing the âfly me to the moon part.â This is a sign. Lovesong â with Robert Smith singing would have been the best but ladies and gentsâ¦ butâ¦this is a sign. Something good is going to happen, itâs not going to be tomorrow â maybe even not next weekâ¦ but itâs on the verge. Though I canât go to the concert â their closeâ¦ itâs close. The future. Something permenante.

						   I have two rants today. One will be babble about myself, the other about people my ageâ¦HA! HA! I will start with myself (so there!) 	Yesterday, oh myâ¦ I was *blech*, *blah*, and *hurumph*. I was thinking Iâm going to have to ask my friends to kick my butt because I was really kind of â not inspired. (Maybe I just needed some sleep?) I donât know? But at the momentâ¦when I woke up this morning â I felt so good. = I sew. = I think you all know that if you need some curtains I could help you outâ¦I got the Queequeg shirts done. Before today I was ready to bash my sewing machine into a mechanical mess. I just couldnât sew! Now, At this moment I am yearning to wrap myself in fabric and thread. I didnât really want to write (not that I conjure words like Jeremy or Christian anyway but still!) â I didnât want to even look at all my pretty markers, pens, and paintâ¦ I normally adore paper and I was ready to put my nice expensive paper on the floorâ¦for my dogsâ¦ if you have dogs youâll know what I mean. - - - I am so ready to go art iNsAnE. I am in an awesome moodâ¦.Iâm fucking euphoricâ¦why? Who the hell knows but Iâm going to stop questioning it. I think Iâm going to sew Samantha, my American Girl doll, her Gryffindor (Harry Potter for all you muggles,) uniform. I just need some dark grey fabric! That doll has a more interesting wardrobe that me. Any whoo!!!   Lethargic and listless â say goodbye! â¦what kind of magic spell to use? Slime and snails â or puppy dog tails â thunder or lightningâ¦ but baby saidâ¦..dance, Magic dance, Magic danceâ¦.. (  *GLURP* ~ RANT TWO! I was elevator hopping with a bunch of people in their 80âs. They were cracking jokes and commenting cheerfully and playing aroundâ¦ I was having a great time with these blue hairs. (I can say that cause I have two different colors of blue hair dye so I can be a blue hair as well.) 	When I hang out with people closer to my own age, all most of them ever talk about is being depressed â âIâm sooo angstâ¦â  	He loves me not. 		I canât. I canât. 			Letâs drown are sorrowsâ¦ Good lord people! Give it up! How old are you? Twenty one, Twenty two? These should be the best years of your life! Do you honestly HONESTLY think you have it that bad? Get off your ass and get out there and use the gifts that god gave you! All the people I know are wonderful, beautiful, talented â fucking creative peopleâ¦ what are they doing with all that gloriousnessâ¦. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Itâs okay to be happy! Iâm happy just because I know these amazing people. We may not be best friends but that doesnât mean I wouldnât help you out if you asked. I see all this brilliance going to WASTE! People donât change unless they want to so â Iâm just wasting my typing skills on all this but I would love to see more happier people my age running around. If Iâm in a elevator with people my ageâ¦ they look like they would rather bite my head off than crack a smileâ¦.heathens! 	Lighten â the hell â up. 		What ever situation your is â it could be worse â Iâm not saying your situation isnât importantâ¦ Iâm just saying, do you really think itâs that bad?...really?...

						   Jimâ¦ that was his name, the TGI Friday cutie. Iâll explain the letter J in a moment but just to add I really know how to pick âem. Heâs the managers son! Nice *Natasha* - âaint it the truth!  	*sigh* Okay â well, he wasnât working yesterday BUT the hostess that was working with him was there so I asked her all this vital info. (She thought it was cute â She was cool.) First I just asked her if he was workingâ¦ 	âOh, no heâs notâ¦âthen I mentioned I thought he was adorable. She smiled, seated a party of four and we continued our conversation. 	âHa, yah well, heâs the managers son.â I know how to pick âem. We both started laughing. I went to my table. Unfortunately most of robinâs friends were girls! Or guys with girlfriends! (Damn it robin!) Thatâs okay. Thatâs okay. ~ So itâs the end of the night my sisters and I were leaving â the hostess was still at the door and there I was, I still didnât have the little muffinâs name. 	âItâs Jim.â Thanks. Oh and if any of my friends want to go out to dinner weâll be going to TGI Fridayâs at the Crossroadsâ¦ (and no I didnât leave my number.) 	~The âJâ phenomenon~ Okay every since I decided boyâs didnât have cootiesâ¦ well not as many cootiesâ¦ I have cute little crushes on these guys with J-names. Jonathan Brandis was the first oneâ¦ my tini bopper crush. *sigh* Back to semi-realityâ¦ I started liking this guy in high school, we never really went âoutâ but weâd hang out and heâd take me home all that âcutesyâ crap. His name was Joe. Then I started stalking this guy in my music class. He was greek! Talk about tiptoeing around each other! There we were last day of school (my birthday so I had already made plansâ¦) He asked me to a Cubs gameâ¦ THE CUBS! Hindsight is 20/20. I should have gone with him. I moved to Florida â my friends sent me a yearbookâ¦ inside the outline of a puzzle piece he signed it. âI really liked you, I wish you could have stayed. â Jasonâ Then there was a Jeffâ¦ I think the only J-named guy I never had a âcrush-crushâ on was Jeremy â not that heâs not a cutie, I just never had a crush on him. Ryan was an anomaly! Well kind of â he was suppose to have been named Jeremy! I also have dreams about the number 10. J is the tenth letter of the alphabet. Either it has to do with the letter J or Octoberâ¦? I know. This is a crazy kind of thinkingâ¦ DUH! This is my blogâ¦ did you expect anything less? And now Jimâ¦.HA! this is the way my life goesâ¦.

						   HA! You know what I noticed todayâ¦ (of course you donât you werenât there!) I noticed that I sing to myself ~ out loud ~ I was sitting around and playing cards and I was singing along with Rhett Miller. âSure,â you say, âI do that to. I sing along with the music.â Wonderful! I think itâs great and everybody should sing along. The only problem was THERE WAS NO MUSIC! There I was in front of people that didnât know meâ¦ 	âYou come and you glow and you hum and you hover â I cannot believe that youâre my loverâ¦â I noticed one lady staring at my wondering what my parents had done wrong. (But then again this lady is recovering from cancer and sheâs still smoking â where did HER parents go wrong!)  Iâve been told I have a song for everything. Now let me say this here and now: I am not a music person. I donât really listen to the radio. I have my own little music collection and I donât know anyone else with comparable tastes. I know Iâm a music follower. My friends will play me an album, I decide if I like it or not (most of the time not.) I know almost every oldies song played on the radio. I do believe NONE of my amigos listen to the oldies of their own free will. HA!HA! Just wait till I get my own car â if I have to drive someone somewhere MY music will be blasting in their ears!  â¦youâve got a heart so big! goes all the way to Californiaâ¦  I like singing to myself....

						   ...I was so excited about finally being able to go out of my house.....  the party is tomorrow!  Okay - so let me tell you about the adorable host that was helping us! He was so bloody cute. And... I didn't give him my number! I know, I know, ME queen of telling my friends "Give 'em your number!" By the way only Christian is allowed to ridicule me about this cause I bothered him the most. But damn were we flirty.   It felt great~  Plus ~ I'll get to see him tomorrow if he works!!! But now there's pressure for me to look even cuter than I did today!!! I thought I might have forgotten how to really flirt flirt... nope nope.... I still got it!!!!!!  But should I give him my number!????? *hee hee* maybe I'll just give him my address...

						   how come things are going so well and I'm so depressed? Quick Overview...  I used to weigh over 200lbs because of the pills I was taking, now I'm at 160 and none of my old clothes fit me! My mom had to take me shopping because my pants were literally falling off! I got a really cute gray pleated short skirt, an awesome punky pink one, two basic girlie cut t's, (one green to match my Converse the other in a light grey,) you can see a picture of my fucking awesome green and pink cons on Christian's blog (thank you Christian!) oh yah - and this button down girlie fushia shirt with black stripes... IT WAS A SMALL - the size I mean, I   I love my new girlier wardrobe. I next purchse is a pair of pink Dickies. I used to have Dickies overalls, they were my favorite pants, when I worked backstage I could carry my hammer and nails, paintbrushes, string, safety pins, gum and my watergun (to spray the naked actors....there's nothing like a the wet look on your favorite actor!)... I still need more girly clothes...  Medically everything is going well, everything is on track now. My platelets are going back up - by themselves... by next week I think I'll only have to take one pill instead of the over twenty pills I used to have to take - no chemo - no nothing! (No signs of Lupus YAY!) My blood pressure is great, my pulse is a little high but I can help that out with exercise - which I have been doing! Everything is peachy.  Since I don't have to work, and I can't go to school - I have all day to do whatever the fuck I want... so what do I want? Brillant question...  I want to get my old shity job back, I want to be bored to tears in front of a college professor that looks like various forest creatures ~ depending on the angle. I want to get the hell out of my parents house (I love them dearly but I'm 24! If my mother tells me to 'clean my room' again I'm going to explode into tiny bits of flesh...) I want to learn how to drive, or rather, how to park. I want a car. A pink car. With flames. White anime flames hot on the tail of faeries on either side. I want to stop being a mooch to everyone I know! Yah, I know I was sick and I still am BUT in my mind I am the most annoying person on the damn planet. Everything needs to be done for me, I mooch for money, car rides, clothes, food, shoes... you name it I've mooched it. I HATE IT! In my next life - hermit - deep deep into the woods - I'll never have to rely on anyone. It'll be wonderfull.   I want to be someones inspiration.  I don't even know when I'll be able to be normal again... at least normal for me.  I saved a turtle today. Driving back from the hospital, we passed the Car Wash on 192 by Valencia/Big Lots area... it was slowly making it's way under the tires of huge redneck trucks. I pushed it into the grass. I stood in the pouring florida thunderstorm rain so my mother could go get a box from a store in the strip mall and so the turtle wouldn't try to hobble back into the road. We're going to take the poor thing to the Serpentariam (sp?) or GatorLand tomarrow. It's almost as big as my forearm. I'm really not allowed to touch turtles so I couldn't find out if I saved a delicate flower or a great typhoon. Girl turtles usually have a flatter bellyshell - while the boys have an arched one...::bachicawahwah::.... I like reptile people. They are the underdog of pet owners - and arguably the most passionate. I've been to reptile shows and dogs shows... some dog people are just too damn stuffy - PLUS at the reptile show the really cute guys had awesome tatoos *sigh a half!* I saved a turtle today.  Have you ever seen 'The Creator' with Peter O'Toole? I love that movie... I'm going to look for the Big Picture... I'll be right back...

						   Badly, I can see the outcome. Please stretch your mind to some thing new. Iâll laugh at you if this comes out my way. Crazy length of string cut to match my mood. Float above the clouds, float in my parade. How long should this be? Two miles long, two miles. You will pick up the girl who walks her dog, Sheâll stare in wonder and fascination. Reality can screw with your glad mind. Pretty, you need to chill, follow me home.

						   A lot of people listen to music in the car, busy lives. Hurry hurry! Thereâs no time! The only time these people know how to relax is sitting in the bucket seats and fall asleep at the wheel because of gentle humming of their car. I adore that purr. I donât drive. I know how but I donât. (It involves money.) I get to sit in any seat other than the drivers and float into the engine. Iâm sure I do way to much floating â so what? â¦.I know you might roll your eyes at this but Iâm so glad that you existâ¦.. I listen to music while I write. I do so enjoy being laid back. (My mom didnât know what âtwangâ was. It was mentioned during CSI and she had no idea what it was â my sister, Laura and I tried to explain it to her. Rachel was there. It was a good conversation.) Florida, state of unconscious. Drive 20 mph. Smell the orange blossoms. Retire. Iâm from Chicago. Iâm different so these thoughts werenât foreign to me but very different. Chicago, itâs the best city in the world. People are usually pretty damn nice â not so much so in New York. New York is the France of the US. California â Iâve never been there. (but leave before it makes you â soft.) I have a pal in the San Diego area. Chicago, always something to do â when I was there they were filming the Weatherman and Oceans 12. The saying was that if you saw a yellow Ferrari, you just saw Nick Cageâ¦ I LOVE him! (He worked with Angelina Jolie!) They were looking for extras but I was caged in the hospital. I love being cheesy. I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A NICHOLAS CAGE MOVIE! They were filming down the damn street from where I was! Chicago, always nothing to do. Tons of empty used book stores, empty coffee shops. Housing is a little expensive but pay is higher. The buildings actually touch the sky. If everyone would grab onto a star, next stop, the moon. Itâs a port city down the river from New Orleans. (Another city I love.) It gets really fucking cold. I love it. Snuggling, but I donât like that word. Nestling? Hiding under the covers with your love affairâ¦ one of my favorite aspects of cold weather. *bleck* Curse the English language for not having a word I can use. It gets sweaty, sultry, sticky sweet in the summer. Lots of running around naked to pretty hate machine. Perfection in between. Rainy beautiful days decorated with grey and wet. Sun and wind. The train. And weâre back to the purr. I get to go back in Sept. then again in March.    Chicago boys are so cute!

						   I've tried to tell Ryan I want to meet her. I know we'd get along. She'll never get the chance to say she hates me or likes me either way if she never meets me...but she has to meet me.  Thank you Rachel. Thank you Elise.  Ryan, stop dicking around ~ let's get on with our lives. I kow what your thinking and stop it. I love everyone and you know it. Cut the crap, I don't have the time to be unhappy, noone does. Everyone desearves to be gloriously happy ~EVERYONE~ You, Cindy, and especially me. I've been too sick for too long to deal with this - this situation sucks.  Let's have dinner! Let's have lunch! Whatever you want to do... no games.

						   I made the shirt, black one. I put a planet in the middle and around this purple and silver planet ~ silvery white letter proclaim GRAVITY ALWAYS GETS ME DOWN. It really didn't come out as kick ass as I wanted it to - but it 'aint that bad.  More petty problems = I think I listen to people. When someone has something to say - especially if it's serious! I always try to understand them and see what's really going on. I wish that when I listened, when I understand and try to make my case that who ever was doing the talking would do the same. I thought there was an unsaid mutual agreement. I was very wrong. My parents think I shouldn't see Ry unless his girlfriend is there - unless she is with us and watching over out every move. We don't want *Natasha* doing something with Ryan that we'll all infer virile young men and women do together... I should understand that Cindy doesn't want me around her new boyfriend and if I were a normal girl I would understand that ~ and damn it why can't I just hate him and curse his name to all the fires of hell like ANY NORMAL ex-girlfriend would do. Can't I understand that? ... ...well...yah, I can. I understand that perfectly. I told Ryan yesterday that he is probably making Cindy upset by hanging out with me. NO AND SORRY... but ~ I'm not normal. Excuse me if I'd understand that my current love affair is friends with his ex. Sure I'd be upset if he had to hang out with her every single day and broke dates with me and was sleeping at her house and eating dinner with her family all the time... but do you see what I'm getting at here? I don't do these things with Ryan, maybe, just maybe I might talk to him on the phone every once in a while, hang out every now and then. I do the same with all my friends. I've spoken more with Christian or Elise or just about anyone else than Ryan. I don't dislike Cindy. I've been pressuring Ryan to let me meet her! She likes Erasure! one of my favorite bands!!! I thought we just get along, Ryan said not yet, it's to weird... That's just me being 'unnormal' again I guess. Well for all my abnormalities my parents won't let me hang out with Ry unless Cindy is there. Ryan has told me she doesn't like me, which probably means she doesn't want to meet me. I've wanted to meet her a while... *lol* I wanted to warn her about 'Ryan' quirks so she'd be prepaired! She'd have someone to complain too and that person would know exactly what she was talking about. So if she never wants to meet me, I'll never hang out with Ryan again. *lol* and I told myself this blod was not going to get personal. Well I might not have posted this except for I wanted Ryan to read this and he doesn't call me back and I thought maybe he might go online...

						   *yawn* Ryan burned me 14 cds. I stole the 15th from him. Having this much new music to listen is blowing my gray matter clear into outer space. Iâm not quiet sure I can call it new â Iâve heard it all before, whatâs changed is that now I OWN it. I got Pink Floyd; The Format; Our Lady Peace; Eels; Lisa Loeb; The Weakerthans; and Bright Eyes. I have a nice Eels shirt and every time I wear this â all I get is âYou must really like eel, wow you eat eel?â  Yes I eat eels. I eat them all up actually.  My coffee smells so good. Coffee gives a lot of people the gitters. Not me. It just tastes really goodâ¦ My mother has drunk coffee her whole life. Puertorican coffee. (The kind the Pope gets imported cause thatâs all he drinks!) Did you know that my family comes from the sugar cane capital of the world? In the middle of town square is a bronze statue of what looks like a migrant worker cutting sugar cane, âcept it ainât no migrant worker. Iâm from Puerto Rico by the way.  Iâd like to learn to be more concise, but I have to much shit to say! Iâd like to grab my dictionary and look up a new word for the day but Iâm too damn lazy to get off my ass and get it. *lol* Iâd like to do a lot. I have to make a shirt today. Iâve got new black and white shirts â virgins just waiting for me to make a bad perverted analogy. Iâve got these lovely lyrics Iâd like to make into shirts â if I didnât look like a damn lesbian I might use these lyrics for my shirts. âcause I likeâ¦birds.  Where as Christian is suppose to be writing â Iâm not suppose to be! What the hell am I doing? Where as Jeremy is suppose to be acting â Iâm not. Ryan, recording; Anthony, directing; Heather, writing; Akiba, creating; (Iâm glad I surround myself with creative talent.) I know Iâm suppose to be doing something creative and wonderful - *lol* I better go do it. I thought of another Queegueg shirt. SAVE THE WHALES! COLLECT THE WHOLE SET! Then all the incarnations of the logo whale. Oh and yesterday I made homemade, all natural dog treats. And all my dogs actually ate them! (I cut them out in the shapes of starsâ¦*grin*)

						   I have to admit it. I really donât like bugs. ~I did have to learn how to pick up those mealworms to feed my turtles. ~ This morning, Ryan calls me. He canât take a shower cause thereâs a spider in his tub. He hasnât been able to take a shower in that bathroom for daysâ¦ thatâs how long itâs been there. I told him to take a box, a container â something â scoot the eight legged terror into the box with a broom and let it out into the free world. He couldnât. I have to admit â I really dislike roaches if I saw one Iâd probably make someone else kill it. There are fifty thousand million billion of those things. Even after nuclear war those bastards will be going strong. I need a guy that can kill a cockroach....!!! But usually, most spiders I can deal with.

						   Watched Simple Irresistible. I love cheesy. Like Water For Chocolate - naked people on horses. I liked it but I hated it. SI I mean. It's about my two favorite things. Magic. Food. I got to the point where Sarah Michelle Geller was kissing Sean Patrick Flannery and they were floating. Like I said. I love floating. I adore floating. My brother walked in and saw Sean freaking out about it.  "I'd love that!" Floating? "Hell yah, if my girlfriend could make me float..."...then he walked out of the room. There's also this thing they do with about twelve mirrors. You could see them dancing. Twelve of them. Imagine if you had twelve of your favorite person. As I grin from ear to ear I can say that was for Christian and Elise! For everyone else too, but mostly them...  I just realized it was about my three favorite things. Magic. Food. Love. and not in that order.

						   You've gone over your blogging minutes this month.....  Okay â the further adventures of *Natashaâs* obvious non-ability to flirt. Itâs so sad. There I was at the Florida Mall. It was a tad busy, guys were there that didnât have girls attached at the hip. Where was I? I happened to be staring at the damn FLOOR! I wasnât looking up to show off these big brown eyes â OH NO! â I was looking downâ¦ what nice shoes you have, nice socks, shoes, shoesâ¦ oooh sandles. What the hell is my problem?  Oh yah, did I mention I was at the Florida Mall, and and and â while I was thereâ¦ I was shopping at what I like to call âskinny stores.â Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagleâ¦ even a little Hot Topicâ¦ I find this type of shopping wonderful and extraordinary. Granted Iâm still not exactly one of those skinny skinny girlsâ¦. yet. Mwaaahaaahaaahaaâ¦â¦. and weâll all float on okayâ¦â¦.. the strange thing about it is actually finding clothes that fit you, look good, and you want to wear them. Have you ever tried looking for fat people clothes ~ you might as well give up, grab the muumuu, and tattoo âfeed meâ to various visible parts of your person. Since I was 16 â since I was 16â¦. I believe it was about two weeks before I was diagnosed with lupus I was shopping at 5-7-9â¦ I had bought a brown sundress. Very plain. A medium blue big flower short dress. Very busy.  You loose weight and become perpetually COLD!

						   Iâm very into lyrics.      â¦went to the porch to have a thoughtâ¦.you still got your words you still got your friendsâ¦â¦my thoughts were so loudâ¦and weâll aLl fLoAt On OkAyâ¦â¦ Modest Mouse likes to float. I like that. I really like that. Ryan once asked me, âWho pays attention to the lyrics first?â I do. But I love sha doâs and la la laâs. Clapping. Who knows why I like clapping. (Maybe itâs a left over Sesame Street thing?) This morning I woke up with the worlds smallest mohawk. After chemo itâs exciting to think you have enough hair for a mohawk. It looks freakân hysterical. After chemo is the best time in a persons life. You really find out, you knowâ¦ your heart is truly full of hope, the actual sensation. Iâm going to get better. Itâs a lot like falling in love.    Sun: 1. self-luminous gaseous sphere about which the earth and other planets revolve and which furnishes light, heat, and energy for the solar â whoaâ¦  I did not just hear thatâ¦.if lifes not beautiful without the pain well I just would rather never ever see beauty againâ¦. Oh my little miceâ¦ why would you say thatâ¦..no no no no no no noâ¦. *sigh* system: it is the star nearest star nearest the earth 2. any star that is the center of a planetary system 3. something like the sun as in warmth, brilliance, splendor, ect. Itâs also a type of plant, a type of hemp. Star: 1. any of the luminous or self-luminous heavenly bodies seen as points of light in the night sky 2. a conventionalized flat figure having (usually five or six) symmetrical projecting points, regarded as a representation of a star in the sky 3. any mark resembling such a figure, often used as an award, symbol of rank ect. 4. same as asterisk 5. regarded as influencing human fate or destiny.    Did you know people used to think certain emotions came from your spleen? Ever read Spleen and Ideal? Damnâ¦ I canât believe I forgot who wrote that! Thatâs why I bought Dead can Dance, itâs a band. When I went to go buy the cd I went home with twoâ¦ Spleen and Ideal and Into the Labyrinth. They were sitting on the rack waiting for me. DCD named themselves after the instruments, they wanted to prove âdeadâ instruments can still make people dance.   When I really like the lyrics and the music â I make music videos for the songâ¦ my own secret music videos. There all in storyboard form. I was the layout editor for my elementary school journal, literary collection â same for freshman year in college.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELISE!!!

						   ... let's tune out by turn'n on the radio!  So I was going to purchase a Format shirt - support my new music - I was sad. No 'girl cut.' I'm sick of having to wear guys attire. Even when I make shirts - I have to buy boys t-shirt packages - okay sure - the breasts look awesome in them BUT the girl cut helps the waistline. After being sick for so long - after... things... I'm ready. My favorite duck pants - I have to post a picture of them one of these days... they don't fit anymore. My tuxedo pants, way to big... it feels great to be getting... skinny *blah* foreign phrases, it matters because why? *shrug* I look healthier... good start.   I dreampt I was a superhero last night - Forget the prince, go for the hero. I'm hope'n to be Jubilee for Halloween. (Lot's of yellow *lol*) There was a micro chip on my roof. And a long story insued (sp?) till my "team" conquered the night. There were lots of cheesy costumes that I love.    Party tomarrow. After fun I'll post like regular. "All of us get lost in the darkness, dreamers learn to steer by the stars."  "Photographers do it in dark rooms."

						   Here we are, trying to plan a party. When I plan a fiesta I try to go all out with the little money I have. I notice the least money I have the more creative I get. My littlest sister Laura is turning 18. Never mind how old I feel ~ I want her to have a great time. We, myself and two more sisters, are in charge of preparations for this historic event. Food, friends, music, movies, and party favors! What the hell do 18 year olds want in a party favor? Iâm 24 and I love cheep plastic. âcanât help it, I guess. I was going to get these cute little watercolor paint sets â my other sister said they wouldnât like themâ¦ the mini UNO was too expensive. I adore âmini!â Iâm so ready to throw this party, some people seem a little less than excited. Weâre going to have a scrapbook table so everyone who goes can fill out a page so she can remember this little lovefest. Neon and music. She (Little Laura) also wants checkered.   HELP THE FORMAT IS STUCK IN MY HEAD ~ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

						   I didnât realize I liked music this much. I use my mothers laptop to write, pop in a cd, type away. Iâm beginning to notice the word âfloatâ in all my favorite songs. I canât help it! I was cleaning out my stuff the other day and I found a black film container, it sounded like a maraca. Okay so what the hell is in this? Beads. Queequeg went to the Sarasota Film festival. Jeremy took apart a necklace he had â I took the extra beads. A space shuttle had went down and he made a shirt. He and Christian were really depressed about it. Ryan got drunk. Anthonyâs car got broken into. Everybody loved Queequeg. Some random girl bought someone a drink. Chris met us over there. We werenât all staying in the same place. Jeremy bought a box of sugar-free cookies and ate them in Ryâs car. I was sitting in crumbs for a week. Just so these Moby Dick boys know ~ I may not be dating Ryan but that doesnât mean youâve lost a cheerleader! Maybe my next shirt should be âqueegueg groupie.â But I still like âsave the whales, collect the whole setâ with all the incarnations of the logoâ¦.

						   Iâm awesomely lucky. At this particular moment, no worries. None. Itâs Sunday morning. I think my dad is home, but heâs sleeping. I do have a lot of things to do. Iâve tons of things most people would tell me to worry about. But itâs all future happenings anyway. My family is getting tired of the tipidy-clakity of computer keys and what they call my âwhiny rock.â They call it other things but I canât hear them - by that point Iâve plugged in my head phones. Besides â At least Iâm alone. Bright Eyes can whine and dine me. Drink me. Iâm full of coffee! Itâs great to have a big family, just â not all the time. If youâve ever read the Weezie at booksâ¦ I read them sitting and waiting at Virgin. I like their world. Not literary genius, maybe the whiny rock of paperbacks.  I just remembered â today is the Cure concert. Break a leg, Robert!

						   Yale gave George W. Bush an honorary law degree. Now heâs an honorary lawyer, the same way heâs an honorary president.  - Letterman  Moving forward. Boy. Okay. I love horror movies and now I have to see Exorcist: the beginning and the Village, though the later doesnât strike me as a horror flick just cause it looks like one in the commercials and itâs M.Nightâ¦ my loverâ¦. Two, I âofficiallyâ am going to Atlanta Bread to shop for men.  Nextly â if Iâm paying does some one want to take me shopping cause I think I need help. Today I had money and fit into a size 12 pair of pantsâ¦ I have not fit into this fantasy in a coons age. Shopping was such a pleasure. I used to run around the Mall *wishing*   Now â I donât.  BUT BUT BUT ~ I didnât know what to buyâ¦ I feel like now I have this *mission* to change my look and my life! Itâs a fantastic mind fuck. Iâm so out of the âloop.â This is ME! T-shirt and jeansâ¦ bad t-shirts bad jeans, really bad. Guys clothes galoreâ¦ Now I have a few skirts, a couple girlie cut Tâs, my shoes, my really really cool shoes (with a cherry on top!) Nowâ¦.NOW Iâm into buying a jacket (just ask Christian the importance of a good jacket.) Nice clothes â I need stuff to go out in â be the muse I was meant to be. Iâm in the process of making my own backpack cause I have my green one with the angel wings proudly sporting a flex of plaid explaining âreal men wear kiltsâ, add a pin suggesting that I float along with the faeries and another to comment that I do listen to the Cureâ¦ delightful, but I want a smaller one.   Anyway, anyone wanna shop?

						   *comfort* Back in my element â adjust adjust â Iâll get there again anyway. My element is wind anyway, I used to live in the Windy city, lucky meâ¦ movement. So I alight onto the land of surreal dreams and bona fide fuck ups. Lucky me. And all I wanted to do today was rant about fat baseball players. Baseball and hockey tastes good. Maybe Iâve had to much baseball, to much of a good thing? But didnât those boys used to be skinnier? Old school please stand up! Wrigley Field rocks my world. Fat baseball players, the fatter the wife the skinnier the trophy girlfriend. I donât care if they can still play â damn fatso, you have maybe THE greatest âAmericanâ jobâ¦ SO GET TO WORK. You never see fat astronauts. If you wanna get fat â become a director â then you can be any size you want without ridicule. What little boy doesnât go to his father and say âI wanna be a baseball player.â Okay so maybe some of them say âI wanna dress baseball players,â either way!... I wanted to be a baseball player! I played pitcher and catcher. I wasnât very good but I practiced ~ I got to play at Wrigley! Iâve seen some larger players make amazing catches, plays that Iâll never be able to imitate, homeruns Iâll never dream of â but have some pride. Wasnât the Babe rather large? Maybe I shouldnât be complaining. It just doesnât make sense to me? Baseball players, astronauts, filmmakers, though Iâm beginning to thing Australia/New Zealand is catching up. (And yes I know India makes way more movies than we do but not the same caliber, thank you very much!) Cartoonist? To regional. President? To puppeteered. The only other great American profession isâ¦ carpetbagger. Cowboy?... Football player maybeâ¦ none seem to be dominated by the female of the species, shock shock horror horror shock shock horror! The only great American profession for women is First Lady! And what will happen to that one when we get a woman president? By the way, any guy laughing out thereâ¦ if it werenât for your mother carrying you around for nine months where would you be â so unless youâre a test tube baby â and even then they still use an egg somewhere in the process. Happiness overwhelms my life every day. (Cause I know Iâm right!)  I was watching a ball game, just shortly â theory testing.  Goodness â I love to babble.

						   There are ghosts in my hospital room. I can hear them. When I close my eyes I can feel them standing in my personal space. Damn rude ghostsâ¦ Four days of watching T.V. to the point of shrinking my already small brain even further than half of our American population. Sad sad sad state of affairs. I have the Chicken Pox. BUT ~ as I was watching the news, Webstersâ has a new dictionary! They were saying some of the new words to the English language but Iâm pretty sure they were just slang. Iâm excited about this new edition. My mom has an older one with pages that are made of a light paper, great definitions. We got a newer model â maybe â six years ago. I need a really good thesaurus. A few more months and I can go back to school. (I think.) I also think Iâm going to have to pay for my own college this time. I have this underlying quote I heard melded to the left side of my brain, just above slumber â âHi! I have a college degree, would you like fries with that!â  	Oh yah, Iâm in the hospital with the Pox. Iâm very ichy. I have painkillers on tap so itâs not to bad. Iâm hooked up to these cute machines that donât like to stop beeping, they must be communicating to each other. I havenât called anyone to tell them â I feel like I bother people with all my damn sicknesses as it is. Whatâs one more? Really? Okay so boredom has kicked in but Iâm mostly just extraordinarily tired cause you never get any sleep in the hospital. *blah* Iâm going to sleep - !   Just in case I've see you in the last couple days - I hope you've had the Pox... if not I'm really sorry, wanna share a room?

						   What happens when thereâs nothing more to say? I reiterate the facts in more and more elaborate words. No matter â you still wonât be able to get through. Life gives you so many wonderful choices. Should I? Maybe not? But it tastes so goodâ¦ and you decide. The decision isnât the important thing in the sentence. You are. I think Iâm pretty forgiving. I think I listen and understand. I donât think I hate anything reallyâ¦ but I *really* dislike it when people donât take responsibility for their own actions. From small stupid bullshit, a purchase, maybe the wrong type of flour; this disresponsibility grows into not going after your happiness. If you bought the wrong type of flour â next time write it down! Donât rely on the person who goes with you to the market to remember YOUR groceries. Then, life goes on. Being happy is very important to me. I donât have time for anger, resentment, jealousy and other such nonsense! Let me be surrounded with freedom, beauty, truth, and love. (Baz has it so right!) How do people drag the muck into there lives and not want to soar brilliantly through the clouds? I understand a little depression every once in a while, things just arenât going your way, ectâ¦ even deep depression â but for that someone better have diedâ¦(only in a few cases do I accept a broken heart.)  Iâm just tired of feeling guilty for shit I didnât do. Get off your ass and find what your looking for, do what your suppose to do, be who your suppose to be â no one can do it for you! You have to do it for yourself! You can live vicariously up to a pointâ¦ Take responsibility for yourself. Live life. Be happy. Everyone deserves to be happy. EVERYONE!

I've purchased chips and dip for the occasion. Quentin....yum.... ...I'm really beginning to like this Uma. Now Angelina I loved right off the bat... but Uma's growing on me... nice uneventful day. walk walk walking. more flirting fun - it's a shame that's not what I'm looking for.

						   when i go to sleep at night - i dream. apparently not many 'adults' do. of everyone. of everything. im a prophet. im mad. simply.  Yesterday I went to see The Village. M.Night, if you ever need a mistress - though I know you'd NEVER cheat on your wife. I got all gussied up. I got "checked out." I checked out a few muffins - I know, I know... save some room for later...*wicked wicked grin*....(when YOU spend years of being sick and average and metamorph into a sex goddess ~ you can tell me to calm down...)  People talk about these dreams where their back in school - naked. I have those except I'm not naked, I'm just never wearing pants... ever. I was back in the fourth grade, Mr. VanSteen was at the chalkboard. And there I was with no pants. Essay time, and I'm the dork that likes them. Students take one and pass it back... I've given you a few resource pages about the topic and... begin... I leaf through pages about satellite systems, the internet, how books are made, magazine clippings about the same, I remember looking out the window and seeing other kids playing in the school yard. Your topic: What is the best type of communication? Between two people, human contact is a glorious declaration of our abilty to communicate. ...I turned that in...  And... I don't intend on waking up, but I was thinking about putting on some pants.

						   1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shine and skin smooth   2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.   3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner.   4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers! (unless ya kinky)   5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being.   6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!   7. Sex is the safest tranquilliser in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.   8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.   9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain. (guess that ever safe "not tonight honey I have a headache" won't cut it anymore...unless u guys are into the hard-f*cking)   10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

						   Okay so Atlanta Breadâ¦ cute guys and the old lady version of Christian â Ha! I completely had forgotten about that and my sister started playing with her boy toyâs digital camera. This older lady was in A.B. and taking digital photos from a little table while her husband carried the food over I thoughtâ¦ hummmâ¦ I wonder if Christian does that...  Photographers do it in dark rooms!

						   When I cross people on the street, sit next to them on the bus â my mind wanders into little stories about how they got there and where they are going. Some people donât let you imagine. Some people smell like 76 open bottles of beer on the wall and slur up to you telling you a nice little spanish girl shouldnât be hanging out with a white girl. Iâm so thankful that only happened once. So a few people win the lottery, others learn to love, little boys get puppies for Christmas. (Most of my stories are *really* sugar coated!)   *blech* Iâm not wasting my time on filth and angerâ¦  Little stories, poetic lyrics, love triangles (though I donât like to be *in* them,) haunted houses and full lives â I love âem. Confidence, donât mistake that one for ego. Appetizers, intelligent conversation, and my newest penchant strawberry wine! Itâs not babbleâ¦ my mind just likes to wander. And all I wanted to say was maybe I like lyrics because I like those poetic stories â brevity set to music. Something I canât do, and I donât want to.

						   And after it was all over she walked into her messy kitchen and... made macaroni and cheese...  That was a dreadfull storm and as I sat on my laundry room floor hopeing all my cats were away from the windows all I could think of was, 'damn is it ever going to END!' I adore rainy weather. I love to dance in it. I love to sleep, there may not be a better lullaby. But ~ this was bad. Knowing me I wouldn't have taken it as seriously if my family wasn't there freaking out about my reading on the couch WAY TO CLOSE TO THE WINDOW!!!  I'd take a snowstorm anyday.  No electricity for two days. No AC... plenty of SWELLTERING HEAT though... I couldn't sleep. I did almost finish with my book. (I read them I don't write them.)  My sisters and I were going to have a Boggle game or two... it was too hot to think! My brain is still a bit singed... I do rather want to finish the pages I have left... then I'm going to rent Needful Things and see how different it is from what I read.  I am really excited about going to see Garden State. I've discussed this a little with Elise and I'm going to have to start stalking Zach Braff. Z  N - think about it!
