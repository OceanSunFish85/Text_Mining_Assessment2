      i recently made a decision to keep loving *superman*, i thought, "hey, i could live with anything life has to throw at me." i thought that i could make things work for us, for the band, if only i tried so hard... and now... im having doubts... my god... i didn't think it was possible... i never thought this would happen but it was face to face that they were trying to separate the both of us... they were trying to put space between us... and i couldn't bare the thought of it all... it was harder than i thought... this is what happened:  my neighbor was on her way home and she offered to give me a ride. of course anything free is worth taking so i thought id go home earlier than expected... *superman*, however, had other ideas and made me stay... so i did and he offered to take me home, which i very much appreciated. hmm... so we went about our ways... then *superman*'s brother arrived and yadayadayada... then it turned out the owner of the house had to leave and so we too had to leave... *superman*'s brother then asked me how i was going to get home, seeing that it was getting dark. i didn't know how to answer and *superman* was the one who answered for me... things were okay until *superman*'s brother told us that he'd rather that *superman* went home... *superman* said that if he'd like, his brother could tag along but he would definitely take me home... his brother then started insisting that he go home instead, he said that things would be fine... *superman* simply shook his head... when the tention died down he said firmly that he would take me home... whew... i was a bit relieved... i enjoyed the short ride to where we were supposed to catch another ride. when we got there, i called for a ride and was surprised to see that it was *superman*'s brother who was getting in with me... i then knew that *superman* lost the argument... i kept quiet while i got a scolding from him about how he's already told me that a relationship in a band will just ruin it... i didn't know what to say... i guess i thought i could have my way, but i learned that i couldn't...  it hurts so bad... i feel terrible... i know he doesn't want us to be together, but the thing is we're not... we try to keep our relationship strictly professional... we really do... and it's hard for us as well... i don't know what to do... things are harder than they seemed at the surface...

      here's a song i think fits the way i feel about our relationship now... what's ironic is that he sang this to me before...   Kailan Pa  by Parokya Ni Edgar  I  Bakit tuwing ikaw ay nakikita Lumulundag ang aking puso Kapag ang tinig mo nama'y naririnig tahimik ang buong daigdig  II  Bawat gabi mag isa akong nagiisip sana ay kapiling ka Balak ko sanay sabihin ko na  ang aking na darama  Chorus:  Kailan pa...ito magagawa kailan pagbibigyan ng tadhana Bukas ba... o sa makalawa  kung hinding-hindi  ngayon Kailan pa...  III  Minsan tayo'y na iwan walang ibang kasama ngunit ng ikaw ay kaharap ko na  di ko masabing mahal kita  (Repeat Chorus)

      hmâ¦ i donât know what to feelâ¦ i just found out he loved meâ¦ i didnât think it could happenâ¦ i guess i was scared like himâ¦ we were afraid to let it happen that we pretended there was nothing going on, and that was our biggest mistakeâ¦  	now the possibilities are endless, anything could happen now, but we have put our music at stakeâ¦ our bandâs musicâ¦ i didnât think this would happen, and now that it has, i donât know what to doâ¦ i could either 1) continue loving him and forget about the band, or 2) forget him in the name of musicâ¦ iâm tornâ¦ two of the most important things were lain in the line and itâs not that easy to chooseâ¦ arghâ¦ i really hate thisâ¦ but just to make it clear, i donât regret anything, at least not yetâ¦ 	i should be happy, now that i know he loves meâ¦ but iâm not in any way glad or ecstatic â¦ and i canât explain whyâ¦ 	our big brother in the band said we should just forget about it because a relationship isnât good in band, itâs the first thing that ruins the band... my friend says if i keep love in a bottle itâs bound to explodeâ¦ 	the thing that made all of this complicated was the fact that he loved me, and somehow, i wish he didnâtâ¦

      my god... i feel so empty right now. and i know damn well i shouldn't feel that way because i have people who love me... my god... but...  when she left, i felt so empty...  i couldn't bare the fact that she has already said goodbye...  and it wasn't even permanent. but i felt a mixture of fear  and sadness  and i didn't know how else to respond...  i found myself in tears,  unable to put my feelings into words... does love really fade? does time really heal all wounds? or does love stay the way it is? sweet as ever... strong as ever... sufficient as ever... damn... i feel like im losing her all over again... it happened once... i'm not gonna let it happen again...

      darn. i feel all light headed and stuff.Ã¼ seriously, this is one of those things you don't just get over with.Ã¼ KIDDING!Ã¼ anyway, im super hyped up because of *drum roll please* a text message i received a while ago. yes, yes, a mere text message.Ã¼ i don't know. i guess i've missed the feeling of having someone text you just to say hi or to tell you they miss you.Ã¼ ha!Ã¼ wala lang.Ã¼ i was major kilig i swear!Ã¼ i passed on a quote to all my bandates.Ã¼ i wasn't expecting a reply from anyone since, you know, guys don't do that much and we're all broke at the moment.Ã¼ lo and behold, a couple of minutes after, there was a message.Ã¼ being the creep that i am i didn't want to spoil the surprise so i cleared my phone and wanted to go to the message step by step: menu&gt;messages&gt;text messages&gt;inbox... i thought it would've been kuya cris or carl who replied but the name read: o_O DJ... oh no. i thought "bakit me credits toh?Ã¼" pero shempre i went ahead and opened the message db? to my suprise the message was from *superman*.Ã¼ my ultimate guy.Ã¼ gheeeheeeheee.Ã¼ he asked how i was and said he wanted to go out to catch a movie or something.Ã¼ whooptiedoo!Ã¼ of course, being the girl that i was, i simply told him that i was doing okay and that i hope he'd already eaten lunch.Ã¼ [i've learned that caring for guys you like/love earns you pretty points.Ã¼ teehee.Ã¼] he replied after an eternity and asked me to watch an audition they were having this friday!Ã¼ i was super shocked.Ã¼ i mean, auditions were supposed to be private and exclusive and stuff so... i'm super thrilled!Ã¼ whooptiedoo!Ã¼ i super want to go.Ã¼ i told him i'd ask my parents if i could watch, but id try my best to do so.Ã¼ he changed the topic and said: "bakit ka nga pla nagtext? miss mo na ko noh?! joke. miss na rin kita eh." oh c'mon. how could i not smile because of that?!Ã¼ i mean, we were just together sunday afternoon.Ã¼ teehee.Ã¼ i realized that i miss being with them.Ã¼ or maybe, i miss being with him.Ã¼ i hope to see him this friday.Ã¼ it might be a big step for me.Ã¼
