       Why is it that every time I see her/him, I long to see youâ¦ Every time I feel her/him  I want to feel youâ¦?  Why do I seek fro you when I have her/him?  I have him/herâ¦ butâ¦ I want you  This is driving me mad. You are driving me mad. Pushing me to the brink of insanityâ¦  because of what you do to me. Even if you donât know it, even if I donât know it.  Because I feel it. Butâ¦ I love her/him  Do I ?  Am I lying to myself ? was I only drawn to her/him because I canât have you? Because I know you can never be mine?  Orâ¦ because I thought I didnât love you anymore? But why is it that I prove to myself wrong when youâre so close to me? So close yetâ¦ so far away. Because I know this is not meant to be  Soâ¦ why did I turn to her/him?  â¦ I didnât want to be alone anymore. Even for just a brief moment  And I realized Iâd rather be alone. Iâd rather be alone than live this lie  Iâm a fool for daring to confuse myselfâ¦ for blindly trusting a complete strangerâ¦ and for tolerating false feelings. And knowing all alongâ¦ but refusing to turn back  I didnât want to hurt her/him  But Iâm hurting her/him more by doing this  And I know it. I know that Iâm lying to her/himâ¦ Iâm lying to myself. Why canât I love her?  Because Iâm still in love with you.  Then why canât I stop?  Because I donât want to  Iâm lost within this void of complexityâ¦ caught within conflicting emotions  Especially when Iâm with her/him. Why does she/he love me?  I want her /him to hate meâ¦ hate me for not loving her/himâ¦ hate me for loving you  I want her/him to hate for wishing that she/he was youâ¦  Fallingâ¦ hah! Such a vague word to say. But just recently, I canât help but use the term again for something I felt inside. Sometimes I think. Why you? Why does it have to be you, of all the people to fall in with? And up to now Iâm still wondering why    When I think about the things that ignited this untouched emotions I canât help but laugh  I dismissed the thought as something unimportant and ridiculous butâ¦ no  I felt as Iâm so weak to fall that fast. the first time I look in your deep, brown orbs, the time we grew quite close to each other because of the nights we shared stories and laughs over the phone.. all were still deeply etched in my mind. Sometimes Iâm moved to the verge of crying because of what weâve become now, so cold and distant to each other.  My sanityâs driving me mad, what shall I do? Thereâs only one wayâ¦ for you to know the truth. The truth that I have hold a clandestine love towards a person I knew I should not love. Butâ¦ I canât. I canât because of my fear towards rejection, pain and love not given back. The half of my mind says I should but the other says otherwise.  Now Iâm more confused of the things occurring. What will I suppose to do? Will I just keep this seemingly unending emotion to my lone self or should I shout to the world what I really feel?    Wellâ¦ I have no choice but to choose the latter. Iâm going to tell you. I know, this note wouldnât even change the way you look at me, the way you show that beaming smile every time I meet you along the road, or even the way you regard me as your friend. But even though this feeling I have for you wonât have a chance to even reach that heart of yours, Iâll be all right.
