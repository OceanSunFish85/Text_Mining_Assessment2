      My favorite Texan, Noelle, came to Paris recently for a visit.  We hit Le Bon Marche, Parisâs swishiest department store, just for the fun of seeing the pretty clothes in the pretty lighting and eating some of the famous macaroons.    Now I love this department store, but it is also the type of place where every third customer is accompanied by a dog-as-accessory.  The only Left Bank department store.  Lots of locals.  VERY bourgeois.    It was, for all these reasons, so refreshing and funny when I held up a  really skimpy pair of hot pants made by Pucci, retailing for about 300 euro, and Noelle said at full voice, in her saucy, southern-direct way, âIâd be lucky if I could get my Pucci INTO that.â

      I need to change banks.  I went in last week to the very small branch of Credit du Nord in my neighborhood where everyone calls me âMademoiselle Fourmont.â  (They must not get a lot of Americans, because one employee even identified me on the phone once).  The 30ish guy who used to be a teller said, his eyes twinkling, âwhat would you say if I told you Iâd be handling your affairs now?â   (Apparently he had been promoted to an officer.)  âGreat!â    He made a few comments about my  bright eyes while his female coworkers laughed knowingly; I decided to focus my conversation on the new female teller who was handling my transaction.   I was deprecating my french a little bit, explaining how Iâd been in the US for the bulk of April and regressed.  Then the young banker cuts in, âBieh, non! If we were to go on a date together, Iâd understand everything.â    Silence.  The women waited for my response.    âAll French men are soooo nice.â   My tone a mixture of playfulness and sarcasm that I hope conveyed:   A. I am not an American prude and B.  Iâd rather not be PUBLICLY HIT ON by my BANKER.  Would this have happened at Bank One in Chicago?

      When I first arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport, I tried to buy an RER ticket into the city from a electronic vending machine.  When I couldnât get it to work, I asked the next man in line for help.  He shrugged his shoulders and said, âIâm effraid thees machine will not take strange credit cards.â  (We were in an international airport, but whatever.)  The point is, the french word for âforeignâ is âetranger,â so Iâm getting used to being called a âstranger,â my belongings and habits âstrange.â  Sometimes I do feel the strange one.  There are these rare, but eye-opening moments where the American way of doing something can seem twisted and bizarrely arbitrary.  (To wit: I walk into a bookstore at Chicago OâHare airport and half the books are self-help.  I realize I hadnât seen one self-help book or Dr. Phil-like guru in my three months in France)  Sometimes I feel like Iâm Alice-down-the-rabbithole and Iâm sure itâs them who have it all backwards.    And sometimes I just want to kick the machine and yell, âNo, youâre the freak!â  Anyway.  I thought Iâd try and highlight some of my Alice-like adventures and explain who I am...   My name is what sells me out.  Clearly French, from the âsâ in Elisabeth to the nasal âoâ at the end of Fourmont (foor-MAAWN).   When I first moved to Paris three months ago with my college-level (at best) French, I dreaded having to give my name because of what would inevitably follow:    FRENCH PERSON:  âAy-LEES-ah-bet Foor-MAAWN?  But thatâs a really french name!â ME:  âYes, actually my fatherâs french, but we didnât speak it growing upâ (said with due remorse, to help soften the blow) FRENCH PERSON:  Not actually sure what they were saying, being as it was so mired by tongue clicking, lip pursing, âcâest pas vraisââs and various gallic manifestations of freaking out.    I love the french, but theyâre SUPER theatrical.    While my fatherâs heritage was not so helpful on the language front, it did plop me smack into what must be the intrepid expatâs dream scenario--full blown immersion into the real-deal Parisian life.  I was âinâ in a way that takes years for so many expats...I was crashing at my french cousinâs apartment and hanging out with all her friends.    Le Divorce came out a few months before I left, and more than one of my friends, because we think itâs funny to talk as if we were in high school, or impersonating Isaac Mizrahi, said âyouâre life is going to be SO Kate Hudson in Le Divorce!â  Ironic chuckling ensued; meanwhile, my eyes were glazing over as I imagined how my life was going to be SO Kate Hudson in Le Divorce!  While it hasnât been as cliched as the the Merchant Ivory adaptation (really, could anything be?), Iâve had my share of seemingly over-determined moments. Iâve had French girls take me lingerie shopping, been to birthday parties for a 21 and 24 year old (no birthday cake to be found, but foie gras was served at both);  Iâve dated a pharmacist who turned out to be recently divorced with 2 kids, eaten cowâs tongue on my uncleâs dairy farm (as the guest of honor, I got the tip), worn a crown to a bar after âwinningâ the traditional new yearâs gallette game, and--early on in my stay here--had several awkward conversations on the phone with guys my age that involved my cousin surreptitiously listening for translation purposes--causing time delays and urgent whispering.  (If your French is iffy, any speaker/receiver action just magnifies the problem.  My father, after 25 years in the US, still has difficulties in fast food drive-throughs.)  I live in a 16th century building in the Latin Quarter (across the hall from cousin actually). The key to my apartment is heavy and large--a perfect cartoon key.  My toilet has a little room all to itself and, absurdly, my shower is in my kitchen.  I had dreams of furnishing the place from Paris flea markets, but I was seduced by IKEAâs willingness to climb my stairs;  I guess some things, like 23 year-olds living in 5th floor walkups with wall-to-wall IKEA, are universal.

      This evening, Iâve been flipping between this really good D-Day documentary and the 1967 Audrey Hepburn thriller, Wait Until Dark.  Iâve pretty much gotten used to watching things dubbed over here.  Monicaâs voice on Friends I applaud.  The actor who does Ross is a shame, but whatever...  Audrey Hepburn though.  It just aint right to mess with that...Reminds me of watching Mission Impossible and not hearing Tom Cruiseâs voice coming forth from that chiseled jaw.    My friend, Guillaume is pretty much the archetypal French-boy film connoisseur.  He once told me that he prefers watching American films in English with French subtitles; unless itâs a Bruce Willis film, in which case he likes it dubbed.  Apparently the French voiceover actor who plays Bruce âapporte quelque chose de specialeâ--he brings something special to the role.     A weird thing I've learned is that, over here, itâs like the same actor who does Julia or Dustin or Reese or, apparently, Bruce in EVERY film.  That's like, their JOB.

      I am starting this weblog on D-Day.  This is totally incidental, but I don't feel I can just jump into being my snarky little self without mentioning it.  Obviously an important day for French-American relations...I am an American living in France.  Iâve been watching the events in Normandy on t.v. all day.  The âDâ in D-Day stands for âdebarquement,â which is what they call the day here.  It means, âthe disembarkingâ or âthe unloading.â    I learned today that Ronald Reagan has died.  He became president the year of my birth, 1980.

      When my aunt and cousin from Richmond, VA visited recently, I had an experience that felt straight out of a Michael Moore documentary (where America seems like crazy-land)--trying to explain the Atkins diet to my dairy-farmer uncle:    âYou mean they donât eat BREAD.  Bread bread??â  My uncle jumped up and grabbed a hunk off the table, sure that there was a miscommunication and I really meant to say chocolate desserts or wild pig.    âYes, well, itâs pretty much the flour thatâs the problem, not the eggs or milk or whatever.â  I concentrated on avoiding eye contact with all parties.  His face registered the bewilderment and pity of a kid whoâd been told some boys and girls donât have t.v.âs in their homes.  To him, bread was nonnegotiable.  Its sponge-like capacity ensured his wifeâs delicious sauces never went to waste and its firm crust carried the cheese to his mouth with a satisfying crunch.  It was, versatile and reliable.  The base of every meal.    Talking to my friend Kathleen the next week, I realized how out of control the whole Atkins thing was getting.  She told me they were now making Atkins DAIRY PRODUCTS.  âIâm sorry,â she said âbut since when is MILK laden with carbs?â    Before I had time to react, she then remembered an even better example. âOkay,â she paused for effect, âCOKE has made a low-carb version.â    I gasped.  With the professional-dieter-seriousness of a Valley Girl, I asked, âYou mean the REGULAR stuff?â    Not missing a beat, Kathleen said âlike, ever heard of DIET?!?â

      There are so many unkind things people say.  Itâs when their words touch your sad, insecure, mushy apple-bruise spots that it really hurts.    In this case, I think you could look like Angelina Jolie and still be stung by what happened to me today.    So my sister and I were enjoying a little âterraceâ dining at a cafe overlooking Place St. Sulpice when we somehow start chatting with the older couple next to us.  I mentioned that my sister was visiting from US.  âOh!  I thought you could be sisters, you have the same....air.  But I wasnât sure...â   The man leaned back and squinted his eyes like a color-blind person trying to decide if two socks match.    âYes!  I see it!  Of course.  Thereâs always a prettier one with sisters!â  He shook his head, like a scientist thrown by a basic principle, but still happy to have solved the puzzle.   âIâm sorry,â my smile was plastered on my face like a bug on a windshield, âand who would that be?â  He laughed heartily--we were all in on a big joke.  âWhy you of course!â He looked at his wife, who looked as if heâs been in this situation before.    I laughed along maniacally.  âGood answer!  No itâs of course my sister.â  I patted Jenniferâs leg and imagined shoving eating utensils up his nostrils.  Happy that we were all in agreement, the man felt free to elaborate.  âSheâs all young, sheâs a doll...and so tan!â  The kicker was retelling the story in the clothing store, Et Vous, to a salesgirl.  She nodded sympathetically, and just when Iâm sure sheâs about to launch into something about how crazy people are, she says, âyes, my sister is prettier than me too.â

      Jennifer and I jogged in Les Jardins du Luxembourg today.  She said later she felt like sheâd been getting some strange looks.  During the jog, I remember hearing a man say âles americans fait chierâ...not a nice thing to say.  But how did he know we were American?  Then I notice she is wearing a grey t-shirt that says âarmyâ and think about the fact that today is the 4th of July.  âJen, you might want to turn your shirt inside out.â
