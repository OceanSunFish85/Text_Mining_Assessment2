      Originally posted as a comment to  urlLink Joe's Hairshirt Blog  :   While waiting for my eighth screening of  Spider-Man 2  to begin, it hit me. As I looked around in pity at all the extremist fans I had seen there seven times before, I had a moment. A horrifying, Hitchcockian, extreme-zoom-in-on-me-while-background-pulls-away moment.   I am one of them. I am also a fanboy. It feels like I'm admitting to alcoholism, drug addiction, or a gambling problem. How could I be so blind?  I've tried to hide it from myself and others since high school by having a job, not living in my parents' basement, getting a non-nerdy wife, being in shape, and driving a sports car. It's still there, underneath. Undeniably.   That initial truth struck me hard, then an avalanche of realizations tumbled down on me. I realized my job is populated with geeks (computer scientists), and that I only seem cool when compared to them because I'm no longer a virgin.   Then I realized "in shape" means that I'm 6'2" and 160 lbs. Sure, I run a lot, but let's face it: I am a gangly, unsightly, uncoordinated mess. People would sooner mistake me for Lyle Lovett rather than Brad Pitt. In fact, I look more like a less-furrowed version of the late Timothy McVeigh. My wife is my own personal Oskar Schindler, having taken pity on me, she got me the last seat on the last train outta Virgintown.   As the starting credits to S2 rolled (which I am nerdy enough to know were done by Alex Ross), I also realized how obvious my nerdiness must be to normal people, kinda like the emperor's new clothes. I think I'm all suave, and they see straight through it, and laugh to themselves.   I mean, I've PLAYED Magic: The Gathering! Enough to know that there's a COLON in the title of the game! I debate the finer points of computer video card minutae with friends at lunch. I have two Spider-Man (McFarlane) posters in MY OFFICE. I play video games until 2 on work nights. I keep up with comic/video game/computer things so that I can buy them/see them the day they come out. The Mariana Trench cannot hold the depths of my geekitude!   Write on, Joe. Write on for all of us.

      I may be an old woman, and the girls I helped raise may have indeed forsaken me. BUT this granny knows good music when she hears it.  This little ditty was on my favorite television program,  Chapelle's Show .  I feel so gangsta when I waddle around the house in my support hose rapping these words!   I battle any sex or any race You beating me is like Billy Crystal playing Scarface I can't see it, blind to the eyes I came up in your face! OOPS....POW....SURPRISE! ooooooooOOHHHH  --Lyrics Copyright 2004 Unnamed Harlem Barber/Rapper
