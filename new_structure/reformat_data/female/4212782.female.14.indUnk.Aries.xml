        This is a sermon that I wrote. I need to make some small changes to it but for the most part it's pretty much finished.          Faith the Size of a Mustard Seed Faith is a very important factor in a Christianâs life. Turn to Matthew 17:20 it says this: âAnd Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.â  Itâs as simple as it seems, which may not be simple at all. It may seem impossible to you to move a mountain. That is because you donât have faith. Just having partial faith wonât work but you need to have a full amount of faith. If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, nothing is impossible for you. Mountains will move in your life. Then youâll move mountains in other peopleâs lives as well.  Turn to Philippians 4:13 it says this: âI can do all things through Christ which strenghtheneth me.â When you say this statement you have to have faith. If you have God in your life and you have faith all things are possible for you.  Turn to James 2:20 it says this: âBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?â Here works is talking about actions. If you have faith that God is alive then put that faith into action by going and spreading the word. An example of this is in James 2:26.  Turn to James 2:26 it says this: âFor as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.â Is your spirit dead? Are you struggling spiritually? Get into Godâs word. Trust in Him.  Turn to Mark 16:16-18 it says this: âHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.â  Talk about extreme faith!! God will reward you for your faith but trouble will come if you donât believe. You will have power if you believe and have faith. Youâll cast demons out of people and theyâll be filled with the Holy Ghost. You will be covered with the blood of Jesus. He will protect you. God will use you as His tool as He heals people. Wouldnât you like to have that kind of faith and those rewards to follow? The good news is you can! Just believe and have faith.   One of the greatest healing evangelists Kenneth Copeland has ever known came up to him and said, âI donât understand it. I have prayed for more than 2 million people. Iâve seen all kinds of miracles, but Iâm the last guy in the world to ever get healed.â  Just think, that evangelist had seen Jesus face to face more than once. His hand had been set on fire with the healing touch of God, but he couldnât live on those experiences. He had to learn, just you and I do, to walk one step at a time--speaking, believing and standing on Godâs promises in His Word.  âWell, maybe thatâs true,â you say, âbut I still think I would have more faith if Jesus would appear to me like He did to that evangelist.â  No, you wouldnât. Turn to John 20:29 it says this: âBlessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.â  Blessed means  empowered. So, according to Jesus, youâll have more power if youâll believe before seeing Him face to face.  Why is that? Itâs because for you to believe something you donât see with your physical eyes, you have to turn inward. You have to see it with your spirit. When you do that, the part of you that is like God rises up and gets stronger.  Am I saying you should avoid seeing miracles?  Absolutely not! Enjoy them all you want. Be a part of what Godâs doing, but donât drop your faith in the process.  First and foremost, keep standing on His promises. His word will work when miracles are happening and when theyâre not. His Word will work in the daytime and in the dark. His word will work for anyone who will put it to workâit doesnât matter if youâre 12 or 92. Remember this: Faithâthe everyday kind of faith you use for livingâdoesnât come from seeing miracles or even seeing Jesus Himself. It comes by Hearing Godâs word.  Turn to Romans 10:17 it says this: âSo then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.â  Turn to John 20:24-29 it says this: âBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands; and reach hither they hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.â  It was a command when Jesus said ââ¦be not faithless, but believing.â God wants us to believe and have faith. When you have faith though, put it into action.
