      Good weather today... this morning when i was out of the house on my way to sch... i thought to myself, wad a nice day, im not gonna let anything spoil my day. It reminded me of Hong Kong... really.... the weather there when i last went back was exactly like this... except that it was much colder and comfortable. Man i missed that place... hope i can go back soon. My mom promised to go back with sis and me after my alevels... so happy... at least i have something to look forward to after Alevels.  Hmmm.... i really dun like ppl who like to compare ppl. I think that everyone is unique in their own ways... can't compare. Im who im... i can't change!!! Damn... this really spoil my day. And do i get angry easily? No lor... i dun. Wadever lah.  Today suck.

      Orh... just got to noe from chih chwen that Portugal beat England in penalties. Argh!!! Not that i support England, they're not bad... Rooney is good... but Portugal can't win!!! Coz i hate them for kicking Spain out in the group stage. Orh...... when spain got out... i was sooo depressed, they're suppose to be good, better than Greece at least. But frankly, they suck... they played so badly in their matches lor... and Raul played badly as well. Actually the reason why i support spain is becoz of him... hahaha coz i think he's very handsome and good!!! Yah but he's not in form recently... dunno why... never scored for soooo long already. The newspapers were all criticising him... feel sad for him... but i think it's his fault ah... perhaps he doesn't make a good captain. U see... he is Real Madrid captain, and Real Madrid is not doing very well... and now Spain team. Orh... i think he should just stick to his role of being a forward... get someone else to be the captain. Then he can just concentrate in scoring goals.   Yay... that's wad i think ah... hehe=) eh... didn't noe it's quarter finals already eh... coz i kinda lost interest in euro after spain got out. Hmmm but i think last night's match portugal against england was exciting since it got to the penalty stage to decide who will get through. haha. Maybe i'll just watch the finals... yeah... that's after CTs... hahah...

      I recently watched a MTV of a korean song... dunno wad's the song title though... not sure if the song is called kiss or the group that sang it is kiss. Okay wadever. Anyway... it's super nice and sad and touching. It makes ppl cry like hell. Maybe u all wud have heard of the story... it's about this guy and girl who love each other,,, and this guy is some photographer... then one day the girl accidentally spilled some acid (apparently used to develop photos) on her eyes... and lost her vision. Wad that guy did was to donate his eyes to her, so he himself became blind. Hur... so sad rite??? The worse thing is that he left the girl without saying anything after giving her his eyes. Soooo touching, Sobsob. Wonder if such a thing will really happen in real life... dun think so hur... i dun believe someone will actually be so wei da enough. but who noes? Haha. I still feel very sad whenever i think of the MTV now... plus the song is sooo nice... im sure my sis will agree with me... haha coz she cried when she watched it in her office... haha...  Orh... and there's a new Korean movie coming up... Ye Man Shi Jie(Windstruck). Oh i cannot wait to watch it... it's supposed to be the sequel to My Sassy Girl. And My Sassy Girl was super nice... very touching too... and i think the girl is super pretty... =) Argh okay i'll wait till after common test... im so jealous coz my sis is gonna watch it on saturday... =P  Okie... think i'll post pics of the girl when if figure out how to...... she's really very pretty... =)   Oh!!! Gez wad... I saw Pan WeiBo on TVee yesterday on Showbiz. He's publishing a new book... not sure wad it's about though. Cool... he's look sooo cute on tv... =) but he look nicer in real life! hahaha... hmmm he got this new hairstyle different from he's Microphone album hairstyle... hmmm look nice for a change... hehe... look more mature. hahahah!!!

Maths was the most terrible paper okie... one hour after the paper started i was still at question 3... and i have problem with almost every questions. Damn... this is bad lor... i think i lost about 35 marks... so an A is impossible already. Ah nvm lar... my maths is lousy anyway. =D  And today's Bio S was bad too... well but better than i expected lah. At least i have something to write, although i dunno wad i was writing most of the time. Bleah... haha. I was damn stressed whenever i looked at joseph lor. He was like next to me and he's writing so much. hur... damn pro. haha...I was trying so hard not to fall asleep. So many times i just feel like dropping my head and sleep! Damn tiring man... it was 2.5 hours. but at the end of the paper i was energetic again... Woohoo... Went shopping with Audrey later on... at orchard. We were talking about our sec school times... haha so funny. We laughed and laughed... make me so happy. Haha. Hmmm yeah then we shopped and shopped and shopped.

I still have like super more to revise on, and judging from my common test results, i need alot more of that!!!  Damn sad, depressed, disappointed... bleah. My results are really bad. It's the worst since all my previous CTs... hmmm i dunno wad's wrong lah... i think i studied the most this time. Im super free during the holidays lar, stay at home qiao jiao everyday... haha, so there's really no reason for doing badly. But i REALLY dunno wad's wrong ah... i got back my chem paper, i nearly died of shock. 49 marks. Man i cannot believe it lar... later managed to find one more mark to add up to 50. Still bad eh??? Ay dun talk about math and phy, so much bloody careless mistakes... argh #%*@%#  Okie... bio and gp left, oh i am not sure if i can take it =P I MUST do something about it... i must aim for better, much better grades for prelims, if not i'll rather die.

Not like i'll stand any chance of getting scholarship. Man... sigh.

Haha... for the first time i walked faster... haha. Anyway the concert was good... yar... this is the first time i went for concert at esplanade. The theatre is damn nice.

The concert ended at about ten, then we went for supper at Haagen Diaz... okay... expensive supper... but nice lar. haha... we took some photos like xiao zha bo-s... haha! Reached home nearly twelve... yar... bathed and went to sleep...

      Your element is Light: Innocent, beautiful, kind-hearted and pure. You are so sweet your almost angelic, you find joy in others happiness and cannot stand to see anyone in pain. You want to make everyone around you feel good about themselves and if someone is upset you can tend to become rather upset as well which means you are sympathetic and raise others above yourself. Being as kind and good-natured as you are people have most likely hurt you in the past but you pick yourself up every time. You may look fragile but you are stronger than most tend to see. Life is beautiful no matter how you look at it and you understand that people make mistakes, not everyone is perfect. You try to see the good in the bad which is a talent few posses, dont ever let anyone change you. You truly have a beautiful soul inside and a heart of gold.

Friday was cool... national day celebration... the performance was nice... i always like watching such things... sooo cool. And terra won the NE trophy... terra was champion! Haha... we are not the last anymore... wah everyone were like sooo high lor... esp the guys in the class... the girls too... haha... damn fun. very funny lar... to see the guys singing so loudly... carrying linlin around during the interhouse game... haha... i almost fainted. hahaha...      Today is like another wasted day lar... went to cut my hair... eh didn't actually want it to be this short. I just wanna trim it... but it turned out... like this. Okay lar... i shall not complain... the lady boss who cut my hair is really nice... talked to me and asked about my life and all... sobz... no one actually bother asking me this question recently lor.       Watched windstruck already.   Finally. Nice. Very sweet. Very sad. The girl is so chio. The guy is quite handsome too.   But i still prefer my sassy girl. Haha...       Long weekend... one day is almost over... three more days... lalala... can't play... so sad... must mug... bleah...      Zhou Jie Lun's Qi Li Xiang is sooo nice lar... sooo sweet... =D

      I kinda waste the whole day away today... tried to revise on medical biotech... realised nothing gets into my head... okie... i give up... decided to go and write my testimonial which i gotta hand in soon if i wanna apply for australian universities.  I was watching TV while trying to brainstorm about every single thing i've done in nj... er... actually i really got not much achievements to mention... so i just write down every little thing that came to my mind. Man i feel damn bhb writing my own testimonial... i mean u gotta praise urself rite... i can't be writing stuffs like im mad or stupid or things like that... haha! Although i really have the urge to write im mad... coz i think i really am! Haha...  And i actually spent the whole afternoon doing this... at least i managed to type it on the com... well... i hope mr ong will accept it or something. My english is very lousy. Hmmm... watched NDP just now... man i really like the fireworks... they are so nice... so pretty. Haha... =) Im supposed to go watch it with a friend. But well... decided not to... coz will be very crowded and all... somemore i got family dinner at home. Yeah... next year maybe.  Fireworks are really so nice lor... they just come and go... yeah... hao jing bu chang zai... eh... yeah. haha...  Okie... i've to spend tml meaningfully... tsktsktsk... two more weeks to death.
