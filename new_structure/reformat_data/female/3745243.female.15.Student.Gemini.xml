      Yesterday, I had to do a lot of cleaning around the house. My aunt and uncle from California happen to be coming over in a couple weeks and our house has to be spick and span. I also want to drastically change my hairstyle. It's long and black, normal Asian hair, but I want it short and blue, inspired by Miyavi. Speaking of Miyavi, I recently bought an extra large black hoodie sweater and in pink on the front, it says "Hello, I Love You". That is the sweater that I must have on when I see Gackt, because I really love him! Also, my mother doesn't like the idea of getting my hair like Miyavi, so we went to Borders Bookstore to look through magazines there. Turns out, she wants me to get bangs and keep it long. I don't like it that way at all. I was surfing through  urlLink http://www.circuitcity.com/  and I found that they had the overseas version of "Moon Child" in stock! I must buy it now! I've been trying to get it for a couple days now, but looks like I may have to do some begging first. But by my next post, I'll definately have "Moon Child" and you can bet I'll be talking about it!  ºòÆü¡¢»ä¤Ï²È¤Î¤Þ¤ï¤ê¤ÇÂ¿¤¯¤Î¥¯¥ê¡¼¥Ë¥ó¥°¤ò¤·¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤«¤Ã¤¿¡£¥«¥ê¥Õ¥©¥ë¥Ë¥¢¤«¤é¤Î»ä¤Î½ÇÊì¤µ¤ó¤½¤·¤Æ½ÇÉã¤µ¤ó¤Ï¥«¥Ã¥×¥ë½µ¤ËÍè¤ë¤³¤È¤òµ¯¤³¤ê»äÃ£¤Î²È¤ÏÈó¾ï¤Ë¤­¤ì¤¤¤¯¤Æ¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤¤¡£»ä¤Ï¤Þ¤¿Å°ÄìÅª¤Ë»ä¤ÎÌÓÍÍ¼°¤òÊÑ¤¨¤¿¤¤¤È»×¤¦¡£¤½¤ì¤ÏÄ¹¤¯¡¢¹õ¤¤¡¢Àµ¾ï¤Ê¥¢¥¸¥¢ÌÓ¡¢¤·¤«¤·»ä¤ÏÃ»¤¯¡¢ÀÄ¤¤¤½¤ì¤¬¤Û¤·¤¤¤È»×¤¦ Miyavi ÃøÂ¥¤µ¤ì¤ë¡£Miyavi ¤ÎÏÃ¤¹¤³¤È¡¢»ä¤ÏºÇ¶áÁ°Éô¤Î¥Ô¥ó¥¯¤ÎÍ¾Ê¬Âç¤­¤¯¹õ¤¤¥Õ¡¼¥ÉÉÕ¤­¤Î¥»¡¼¥¿¡¼¤òÇã¤¤¡¢¤½¤ì¤Ï"¤³¤ó¤Ë¤Á¤Ï¸À¤¦¡¢»ä¤Ï"°¦¤¹¤ë¡£¤½¤ì¤Ï»ä¤Ë»ä¤¬ Gackt ¤ò¸«¤ë¤È¤­¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤¤¥»¡¼¥¿¡¼¤Ç¤¢¤ë¡¢»ä¤¬¼ÂºÝ¤ËÈà¤ò°¦¤¹¤ë¤Î¤Ç! ¤Þ¤¿¡¢»ä¤ÎÊì¤Ï Miyavi ¤Î¤è¤¦¤Ê»ä¤ÎÌÓ¤òÆÀ¤ë¹Í¤¨¤ò¹¥¤Þ¤Ê¤¤¡¢¤½¤¦»äÃ£¤Ï¥Ü¡¼¥À¡¼ËÜ²°¤Ë»¨»ï¤òÄÌ¤Ã¤Æ¤½¤³¤Ë¸«¤ë¤³¤È¤ò¹Ô¤Ã¤¿¡£¤Ê¤ë¡¢Èà½÷¤Ï»ä¤Ë¶¯ÂÇ¤òÆÀ¡¢¤½¤ì¤òÄ¹¤¤ÊÝ¤Ã¤Æ¤Û¤·¤¤¡£»ä¤ÏÁ´Á³¤½¤ì¤ò¤½¤¦¤¤¤¦É÷¤Ë¹¥¤Þ¤Ê¤¤¡£»ä¤Ï http:// ¤Ë¤è¤Ã¤Æ¥µ¡¼¥Õ¤·¤Æ¤¤¤¿WWW ¡£circuitcity ¡£com/ ¤½¤·¤Æ»ä¤Ï¤½¤ì¤é¤¬ºß¸Ë¤Ç"³ªºÂÀ¸¤Þ¤ì¤Î¿Í" ¤Î³¤³°ÈÇ¤òÍ­¤·¤¿¤³¤È¤¬Ê¬¤Ã¤¿! »ä¤Ï¤½¤ì¤òº£Çã¤ï¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤¤! »ä¤Ï¥«¥Ã¥×¥ë¤º¤Ã¤ÈÆü¤Î´Ö¤½¤ì¤òº£ÆÀ¤ë¤³¤È¤ò»î¤ß¤Æ¤¤¤ë ¤·¤«¤·ºÇ½é¤ËÍê¤ó¤Ç¤¤¤ë»ä¤¬¤¤¤¯¤Ä¤«¤ò¤·¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤¤¤«¤â¤·¤ì¤Ê¤¤¤è¤¦¤Ë¸«¤ë¡£¤·¤«¤·»ä¤Î¼¡¤Î¥Ý¥¹¥È¤Ë¤è¤Ã¤Æ¡¢»ä¤Ï´°Á´¤Ë"³ªºÂÀ¸¤Þ¤ì¤Î¿Í" ¤¬¤¤¡¢»ä¤¬¤½¤ì½Ò¤Ù¤Æ¤¤¤ë¤³¤È¤òÅÒ¤±¤ë¤³¤È¤¬¤Ç¤­¤ë!

       English ±Ñ¸ì   I pretended not to notice And stared far out the small window The angel's voice spreading in the sky Was embraced by the wind  The commotion reflected in your eyes can't hear anything Only now I murmured "It was a trick from when I was na«Áve" Into the sky  Turn, turn...

        Name : Janne De Arc   Gender : Male   Race : French Vampire   Age : 26   Hair Color : Auburn   Eye Color : Transparent Green   Attire : Black and gold embroidered vest with a thin white shirt underneath. Long black trenchcoat with gold cuffs and a high crimson collar. Black leather pants and black knee-high leather boots. Acessorises with a white scarf and a silver cross-chain necklace.   Biography : A very young vampire, Janne De Arc retained the name of his wealthy French ancestry, seeing himself no different than when he was a human. He was fascinated by the past, the chivalry of swordsmanship in particular. He tried to teach himself fencing when one night during his practice, he encountered his black-hearted twin brother with a bloodthirsty vampire at his side. Being born mere minutes before his twin, Janne De Arc was next in line to the throne, but after the vampire's French noble feast, that was soon forgotten. Janne De Arc himself hated being a vampire and frequently harmed himself, despite his vampiric immortality. He hunted down his sire a year later and killed him, leaving a bloody mess behind on an English storefront. Though he was once a French noble, that didn't keep him away from hunting the blood of anyone that passed his sight at night. He'd heard of vampires that swore to use their vampiric abilities to benefit others, but that wasn't something Janne De Arc would ever swear to. He knows that the blood of an Angel could restore his humanity, which is something he greatly desires, but he never believed that they were real for him to do so. Despite this, he drifts around in life, causing havoc wherever he walks, leaving a bloody trail behind him, showing others who they shouldn't mess with.

          Congrats! You're Gackt's beloved little pooch! But don't be fooled! You may not seem much bigger or stronger than your partner in crime, May, but you can still pack a punch of your own. Fiercly loyal to your friends/masters, you jump at anything that could endanger them. Although, sometimes you get in over your head when your bark turns out to be worse than your bite, but don't worry. You're a brave little toaster who can fight their way through anything, cause it's as the old saying goes: "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog."  ¤ª½Ë¤¤!Gackt¤ÎºÇ°¦¤Î»Ò¸¤ºÂ¤Ç¤¢¤ë!¤·¤«¤·¤À¤Þ¤µ¤ì¤Æ¤Ê¤¤¤Ï¤¤¤±¤Ê¤¤!¤¢¤Ê¤¿¤Î¶¦ÈÈ¼Ô¤è¤êÂç¤¤¤ËÂç¤­¤¯¤Þ¤¿¤Ï¶¯¤¤¤è¤¦¤Ç¤Ê¤¤¤«¤â¤·¤ì¤Ê¤¤ 5·î¡¢¤·¤«¤·¤Þ¤À¤¢¤Ê¤¿ÀìÍ­Êª¤ÎÀü¹¦´ï¤òµÍ¤á¤ë¤³¤È¤¬¤Ç¤­¤ë¡£¤¢¤Ê¤¿¤ÎÍ§¿Í¤ËÈó¾ï¤ËÃéÀá¥Þ¥¹¥¿¡¼¡¢¤½¤ì¤é¤ò´í¸±¤Ë¤µ¤é¤¹¤³¤È¤¬¤Ç¤­¤ë²¿¤Ç¤â¤ÇÄ·¤Ö¡£¤¬¡¢¤¢¤Ê¤¿¤ÎËÊ¤¨À¼¤¬¤¢¤Ê¤¿¤Î¤«¤ß½ý¤è¤ê°­¤¤¤Ê¤ë¤È¤­»þ¡¹¤¢¤Ê¤¿¤ÎÆ¬Éô¤ò¾è¤ê±Û¤¨¤ë ¤·¤«¤·¿´ÇÛ¤·¤Æ¤Ï¤¤¤±¤Ê¤¤¡£²¿¤Ç¤â¤Ë¤è¤Ã¤ÆÊýË¡¤òÀï¤¦¤³¤È¤¬¤Ç¤­¤ëÍ¦´º¤Ç¾®¤µ¤¤¥È¡¼¥¹¥¿¡¼¤Ç¤¢¤ë ¸¶°ø¤½¤ì¤Ï¸Å¤¤³Ê¸À¤¬¹Ô¤¯¤ÈÆ±»þ¤Ë¤¢¤ë:"¤½¤ì¤ÏÀï¤¤¤Î¸¤¤Î¥µ¥¤¥º¤Ç¤Ê¤¤¡¢¤½¤ì¤Ï¸¤¤ÎÀï¤¤¤Î¥µ¥¤¥º¤Ç¤¢¤ë¡£"   urlLink   Gackt Quiz*~*Which Gackt Weapon are you?*~*~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      For some strange reason, I had the urge towake up before everyone else and get on the computer. My mother is angry at me for some strange reason (note the use of "some strange reason") and has been giving me the silent treatment. It's a good thing she hasn't grounded me or anything or else I would've died without my daily dose of JRock PVs. Feasting upon nothing for breakfast, I ate the computer most of the day today, eating some seaweed snacks on the side. A rather boring day actually, hoping to buy GLAY's latest DVD recording of "The Frustrated". Quizzes coming later today and maybe the first paragraph or two of my latest story the next couple of days.  ´ñÌ¯¤ÊÍýÍ³¤Î¤¿¤á¡¢»ä¤Ï³§¤ÎÁ°¤ËÌÜ³Ð¤á¡¢¥³¥ó¥Ô¥å¡¼¥¿¤ÇÆÀ¤ë¾×Æ°¤òÍ­¤·¤¿¡£»ä¤ÎÊì¤Ï´ñÌ¯¤ÊÍýÍ³¤Î¤¿¤á¤Î»ä¤ÇÅÜ¤Ã¤Æ¤¤("´ñÌ¯¤ÊÍýÍ³" ¤Î»ÈÍÑ¤ËÃí°Õ¤·¤Ê¤µ¤¤) »ä¤Ë¤º¤Ã¤ÈÌµÀ¼½èÃÖ¤òÍ¿¤¨¤Æ¤¤¤ë¡£¤½¤ì¤ÏÈà½÷¤¬»ä¤ò´ð¤Å¤«¤»¤Æ¤¤¤Ê¤«¤Ã¤¿¤Þ¤¿¤Ï²¿¤Ç¤â¤Þ¤¿¤ÏÂ¾»ä¤ÏÆüËÜ¤Î¥í¥Ã¥¯¡¦¥ß¥å¡¼¥¸¥Ã¥¯¤Î¥Ó¥Ç¥ª¤Î»ä¤ÎËèÆü¤ÎÀþÎÌ¤Ê¤·¤Ç»à¤Î¤¦¤è¤¤»ö¤Ç¤¢¤ë¡£Ä«¿©¤Î¤¿¤á¤Î²¿¤â¤Ë³Ú¤·¤à¡¢ »ä¤ÏÆü¤Î¥³¥ó¥Ô¥å¡¼¥¿¤òº£ÆüºÇ¤â¿©¤Ù¤¿¡¢Â¦ÌÌ¤Î¤¢¤ë³¤Áô·Ú¿©¤ò¿©¤Ù¤ë¤³¤È¡£¼ÂºÝ¤Ë¤à¤·¤íÂà¶þ¤¹¤ëÆü¡¢GLAY ¤Ç"¼ºË¾¤¹¤ë" ¤ÎºÇ¤âºÇ¶á¤ÎDVD ¤ÎÏ¿²»¤òÇã¤¦¤³¤È¤ò´õË¾¡£»ä¤ÎºÇ¤âºÇ¶á¤ÎÊª¸ì¤Î¥¯¥¤¥º¤ÎÍè¤ë¤è¤êÃÙ¤¤º£Æü¤ª¤è¤ÓÂ¿Ê¬ºÇ½é¤Î¥Ñ¥é¥°¥é¥Õ¤Þ¤¿¤Ï2 ´öÆü¤Î¼¡¤Î¥«¥Ã¥×¥ë¡£
