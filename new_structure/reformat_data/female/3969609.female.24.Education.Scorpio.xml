         I have many talents, and one of them is suffering.  By day, I am a Career Services Specialist; by night/weekend, I morph into a Suffering Specialist. I can mourn, grieve, pout, linger, and gnash my teeth with the best of them. And this from the pom-pom waving, maniacally grinning, "why-is-she-so-fucking-happy" girl I have been the better part of my 24 years.            My most oft-uttered phrase as of late is, "I have no smiles left."  Which is stupid, of course, as I smile all the time. I smile when I re-read journals documenting all the hilarious happenings over the years. I smile at both the much-favored students and the Pains In Our Collective Asses. I smile with Rebekah and Dana, Goddesses Among Women, constantly--I couldn't be around them and feel any other way. I smile with Aaron Neal, who is cuter, sweeter, and savvier than any other man-boy to date. (Or, as he himself put it once, "After I've spent the afternoon with you, my jaw hurts." [From smiling.]) I smile at Wee Boy Holden, Illegal Kitten Man, and I smile when I talk to any ofthe myriad friends and even relatives who have brought so much joy now and always.           And yet. Yet, yet, yet...there are the times in which this overwhelming sadness--I can't describe it any other way, even for fear of outright triteness--sets in, and there is no return to normalcy. Not for a good 24-48 hours, at least. So I ought to be thankful for that, I think: I rarely lose more thana day. But of course I'm required, later, to bemoan the fact that an entire  day  of my life--and I only get one life!--was just wasted. Let's examine yesterday, for a fine example. It's a Sunday. It's a perfect day to *finally* clean my room, to bond with Holden, to catch up on my phone calls, to crank out some Pilates, to work on grad school applications, to write something that will exponentially increase the chances of my being accepted to a grad school for, let's face it, a writing program. But did I devote energy to any of the above-listed activities? No. No no. Instead, I loitered. I gnashed, I cried, I dwelled. I had no smiles, and I can't believe that I left that many tears in his bed. I shouldn't even  have  that many tears in me--not when I have a good job, good friends, a good dye job, a good apartment, a good car. What about the times in my life (circa one year ago!) in which I was woefully unemployed, still hearing strains of "How dare you use that negative phraseology with me!" and seeing visions of Barbie Dolls dancing in front of my closed eyes. What about all the times I longed for someone to love me for  me?  What about all the times I joked, "There is a void in my life that only a cat could fill"? Here is what: when I look at those times, I just wonder, "How did you even?" How did I even survive--how could I cope?          I think the same thing when I assess the situations of so many of my students. I just think, "If I were you (mother of three, single, poor, struggling, with no immediate light at the end of the tunnel), I would be so depressed that I wouldn't even try." And where is an attitude like THAT helpful to me--in either a personal or professional realm?! If I truly believe that, then why the hell do I even have the job I do? Furthermore, why can't I look at them and think, "Wow. They really have it together...and I'm EVEN luckier, seeing as I never, thankfully, had to juggle classes and child care. I'm very blessed." And then I just feel WORSE and EVEN MADDER at myself for NOT being so very thankful for the myriad blessings. I just won't let myself win.          "You're  so  hard on yourself," everyone says, but I'm not, really. I'm just realistic. I know that I should be better than I am--and hot on the heels of that thought is this one: "Who the fuck do you think you are, and what kind of ego do you possess, to think that you should be so much better off than you are?" I cut myself v. little slack; I realize that. But in other ways, I'm so very easy on myself. Do I watch what I spend/eat/drink/screw? Well, yes. And no. I'm spending money more lavishly than I ever have, I eat out all the time, I have a dangerous inclination when I'm drinking to wonder "Why don't I do this MORE?", and I use sex as an escape. Or would, save for the fact that it always ends up being a startling penetration (no pun intended) into reality--a reality I don't want. A reality that scares the bejeesus out of me.          And so, in conclusion, I've been promoted from the Assistant Director of Suffering to the ever-prestigious title of Suffering Specialist. I have chosen my fields to suffer in; they are Daddy Woes, Body Issues, Lack of Letting Go-ness, and Deadly Comparison Games. I occasionally dabble in "I'll Never Do Anything With My Life" and "I'm So Ugly," too. These are just a few of my specialties; what are yours?
