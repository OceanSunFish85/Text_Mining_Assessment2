         What a beautiful day it is! Finally the fog has cleared and the sun is shining through. Awww, feel the hot hot sun! I know some people think I'm crazy for loving the heat this much but coming from a cold climate state I think I'm entitled to enjoy as much of the hot/humid days as I please.               I feel so "girlie" with my hot pink strapless shirt and my crisp white capri's. Another reason to enjoy the beautiful day. Dressing sexy. There's nothing better than feeling sexy and good. Now all I have to do is wait until 4pm to actually ENJOY the day. :)               Aiden (my 8 month old son) woke up in a wonderful mood as always. If there's one thing I can say about Aiden it's that the kid definitely wakes up in a good mood... and very early. Alright, I know that was two things but who's REALLY counting?               Today, he woke up when his daddy got up for work like usual at about 5:45am. First he Nuzzles the pillow (yes he wakes in our bed... reason being that when he wakes at 3am I don't want to wait up for him to get sleepy again so we bring him into bed with us.) and then he looks to the left (Daddy's direction) and upon eye contanct quickly buries his face back into the pillow. Then he looks to the right (mommy's direction) and upon realizing that mommy is still sleeping and not in the mood to play he quickly looks back to the left (Daddy's direction). This time upon eye contact he begins to laugh, exposing his littletooth... and then again proceeds to burry his face back into the pillow. Now this continues for about 5 minutes. At which point Aiden decides he's awake enough to play. Crawl, crawl, crawl... after Daddy laughing the whole way.               Now I'm neverREALLY asleep. Just resting my eyes for fear that as soon as there open my day will begin. I know you're probably thinking...sure your "resting your eyes"... but trust me if I was then I wouldn't know their (Aiden and Miguel) morning routine.               So, getting back to today... Daddy finally hugs Aiden...his feet scrambling in pure excitement...and kisses him all over and sets him back down to lay next to "sleeping mommy". He sternly (well as stern as you can possibly be to an adorable 8 month old baby...:)) says for him to "be a good boy for mommy". HA! Who is he trying to kid? He just got him all fired up and ready to play. Mommy, is not "sleeping mommy" anymore.               I usually try to sleep/play with him during these early morning hours (I'm not a morning person as you may of figured out) but there always comes a point when I realize that it's just not worth torturing myself (speaking of my secret desire to sleep a little longer) and I get up and begin preparing for the day ahead.               This morning, as I mentioned before was wonderful. BEAUTIFUL!        Hence the title! Hence everything in my life... Beautiful family, beautiful son, beautiful boyfriend, beautiful home, beautiful day!        Now we'll see what the afternoon has in store for me!

        Origionally I thought that life would get easier to understand as I got older. Looking back on that prior thought that consumed my mind for many years I want to laugh and shake myself for being so nieve. What was I thinking? The only thing that gets easier is not caring what people think... well okay maybe the only thing that get's easier is faking that it "get's easier with age".           I'm 24 years old. Single. Well, not technically because I'm in a relationship but in the grand scheme of things still single. Marriage is a word we've "thrown around" but I think it's just for the sake of appearing to be moving in the right direction. I can't say that I find myself caring all that much these days as I'm beginning tothink that I may just be in love with the idea of the wedding event and not so much the purpose of the event. Is that awful? I can't seem to find the awful in it... more honest than awful but...          I'm a woman. I feel like a girl but I guess I've hit that period in my life where I should begin classifying myself as a woman.Afterall I have a child. A beautiful, wonderful, youthful baby boy.           Aiden, my son, is 8 months old.Giving birth to such a beautiful beingIS my greatest success in life. Ahhh...Love is having a child. I truly believe that. Life with him has given me self worth. A meaning. Destination. Responsibility. He has taught me how to let things go, relax, become more observant, and realize, FINALLY realize that I am important.                 Aiden, my beautiful son
