           BODY { scrollbar-face-color: #000000; scrollbar-highlight-color: #FFCCCC; scrollbar-3dlight-color: #666666; scrollbar-darkshadow-color: #FF00CC; scrollbar-shadow-color: #FF66CC; scrollbar-arrow-color: #FF99CC; scrollbar-track-color: #FF99CC; } --&gt; Ive been up for almost 36 hours straight. I think I have insomnia or something. I don't know why I havent been sleeping. It just seems like life is to short to be wasting it on pointless dreams. I was suppose to go with my mom, her boyfriend [Bill], and my sisters [Jessica,14, Jullia,12] But by two oclock...I was having sinus pains, watery eyes...the works for a common cold. I was somewhat relieved that I didnt have to go. I was busy working on a website I have been developing for my personal interest and some extra cash. My mom is telling us that we can't go shopping for clothes anymore becuz, since she is buying a house we are on " a budget"! I am a growing girl, clothes arent a priveledge, its a right! Actually its a law! I don't want to look like I can't afford clothing! I happen to be a very fashionable teenager! But newayz, I had plans to go to the movies tonight..to finally get out of this tiny, rinkey dink apartment. But since I dont DRIVE yet, my mom was supposed to take me.......the bitch and her boyfriend come trotting through the door at about 11:30 pm. arrgghh! I miss my movie, Jose thinks I totally DITCHED him. What a fantastic day. Oh thats not it yet.....OHHH no! When my jollie little sisters come home, they think they can be like, "Jenn, look at this place...you need to clean it up!"--------who the fuck am I? Cinderella!? But I also get the smallest room in the house b/c "BILL" the enforcer said so! He aint even paying for the house!! Who the HELL does he think he is???? Gosh, its not the fact that I'm getting the smallest room, fuck, I dont care. Its just that HE was the one who said that I was going to get it. He is NOT my father, I dont need him to acting like it. The only reason that he said that I get the smallest room is b/c I dont listen to him when he tells me to do somthing. Man, the nerve of that fat ass jerk! Well.....stay tuned for the next chapter in my life tomorrow......................or whenever the fuck i feel like writing another chapter!
