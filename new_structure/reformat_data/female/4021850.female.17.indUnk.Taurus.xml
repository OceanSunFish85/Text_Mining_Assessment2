       Anyone who view my diary, u guys can leave any comments if you guys want~!   This is my first diary...In this diary , i wanna write something different from my xanga~!  Today is Saturday, i will goto vietnam beef noodles restaurant have a lunch. Then , i will go to Library... STUDY STUDY STUDY... Mygoal is to get an average A... HOpe i will do well in the last test...   Back to single again... Single is good...Sentiment is hard to express the feelingz... It's easy come and easy go...When it's gone, it's gone... Past was past, don't think back...It didn't have "Miracle" in this world. Don't have too much hope that"he" will come back... He is so dump... don't think about ppl's feeling, just do what he wanna do... SO SELFISH... Maybe i am the one who is the most selfish... After "he" and I had a year relationship, from begining to the end. At the end of love, He makes me think "Love"will make me confused, complicated and no confidence... Who can give me back the conifidence of LOVE?????????

       Kevin, how can you do that to me? i mean........ i have already gave you love through a year and when we broke up, u just ......... ignore me..... how come? what did i do wrong with u, huh?After we broke up , i REALLY INSANE... I think the guys who love or like me just like my apperence not my heart... but actually... they really like my heart. But I don't know why, I still..... miss you... non-stop thinking about u... I really can't adapt a new love, I really no confidence on it. My best friends told me that i must get over it... I will... I hope.....      Johnny, I really felt sorry for you... i shouldn't start with u in the beginning... I'm so sorry... You and your friends must hate me a lot... i know... but i really really so confused..... I should forget about him anymore... sorry~

        Last night, I was waiting someone to online msn to talk with me. Because he said he will be back online in 5 minutes... Then, I wait.........i wait....... and i wait...... at last, i can't wait him to online then i went to bed at 12:15pm.  This morning, I arrived school at 7:55am. I arrived there 5 minutes early than normal time..... which means I have to arrive school that early too......... I usually late 1 minute to school. Today, the teacher, Mr. Steptenson, taught us a lot of stuffs that made me so confused. I hope when i studied it, i will understand it.During class's break, my friend who is from Hong Kong. Hetricks me and make me to buy him candies......ai........ i won't get his trick anymore....... Then, I saw Justin has a yummy chips so i bought it. Yummy....... Today most of my classmates slept in class... maybe they didn't sleep well last night. I almost want to fell asleep too because i am not feeling well today. After class, I went to school Library to research my project's stuff. And lawrence saw I got lots of information then he copied my research...urgh...... hope his project won't be similar as mine. After that, I went to Pho's beef noodles restaurant by myself. I ordered my favourite dishes which is "Seafood Dry Noodles". Next time,I must bring my own lunch because that will make me save money and time. Then I went to Langley Library to study. I ate and studied alone, I really want to have a partner or friends to study with me... I don't wanna be alone. JAMIE, BE INDEPENDENT AND MATURE... OK? Tomorrow i will have a quiz and a test, God bless me and hope i willget a better mark to upgrade my average too~!

       My host mom got a week off so i usually see her at home~^^ Today i did bad in the quiz, 11 out of 15... so bad... my average won't upgrade anything... "Yellow sunshine" wants "FBI" to exchange the average... haahaa~!IMPOSSIBLE~! Hmm..... today test i did half of it, tomorrow will be continue... I hope i will do well on it... Today at school, Tristan and Kevin keep picking on me... that's ok... I always tricked by anyone... hmm... Today quiz, I am not satisfied and Tristan saw that i got  NO SMILE  on my face... then he used two fingers to put on his face and expand his both side of his lips which mean he remind me to   SMILE~!   Even I did bad on my test, just think i will do good in the next test~!I did tell everyone I studied ,actually I didn't study... I was in the internet all the time... In Library, I used my Library card to go in internet too... didn't study much...    JAMIE...URGH...STUDY, PLEASE...    I didn't go to Library after school because no one are gonna be there... and i usually won't do anything... so stay home rather than go there and do nothing... From now on, I must be on diet... because i discover that i am getting fat~!   Oh~! We must hand in the Chemistry Project on Thursday... I will start it tonight~!       Below those two lyrics are sooooooooooooooooooooo good~^^

       I could stay awake just to hear you breathing, Watch you smile while you are sleeping, While you are far away and dreaming, I could spend my life in this sweet surrender, I could stay lost in this moment forever, Where a moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,  I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep, Cause I miss you baby, And I don't want to miss a thing, Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream will never do, I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing  Lying close to you feeling your heart beating, And I wondering what you are dreaming, Wondering if it's me you are seeing, Then I kiss your eyes and thank god we're together, I just want to stay with you in this moment forever and forever forever  And I don't want to miss one smile, I don't want to miss one kiss, I just want to be with you right here with you, Just like this, I just want to hold you close, I feel your heart so close to mine And just stay here in this moment,For all of the rest of time

       If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?   If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?   If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call   If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all      I never know what the future brings    But I know you are here with me now   We'll make it through    And I hope you are the one I share my life with      I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand   If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?   Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?      If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?   If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?   If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?   If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?      I don't know why you're so far away    But I know that this much is true   We'll make it through    And I hope you are the one I share my life with   And I wish that you could be the one I die with   And I pray in you're the one I build my home with   Ihope I love you all my life      I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand   If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am   Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away   And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today'   'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right   And though I can't be with you tonight   And know my heart is by your side'

       This morning, I saw a spider walked under my bed.........ahhhhh......... hope it will be dead and no babies there.......thanks god.......Finally, I have done my project this morning. Then, we have another small project coming up... OH, MY GOD~! another one again?! Actually, I did it in the Library today~^^ I totally don't understand what the teacher taught us today... So confused... I will try to figure out what was the teacher talked about in the text book tonight. Before break, the teacher taught a lot, made me so muddle... After the break, we went to Library to research our small project and did our assignment. During that time, Kevin was so annoying... He kept bothering me and got my hat off... I really don't know what he was thinking... I know u guys like to bully me and I know I am feeble. I didn't mad at you guys just don't always bully me all the time, especially during the class... I did my homework so slow, Tristan had finished his homework already... I am stupid, I can't understand stuffs quickly... Tristan teaches me all the time and I always can't get it immediately... Sorry, Tristan... forgive my clumsy brain... I should change my study attitude too because I learnt things really slow... ai................        Is that lovers can't back to real friends after all? Is that true?    If so,I won't choose them to be my lovers rather than to be a friend.    Even that I really like the guy, i will treat him as a real good friend.

       Today everyone got mad and it was unlucky day too~! First , when i woke up my neck was so sore, i think i didn't sleep probably~! Last night, I dreamed a guy and I were talked a lot, I didn't know what we were talking about then my dream awake... I can't see the guy's face in my dream... so weird.....maybe that's my future husband... haahaa~! I did my quiz and did it not bad... but something happened here... One of my classmates loved to cheated in his tests and quizs, unfortunatly, I got his quiz which means i had to check his answers... well, i afraid he will scolded me that why i don't correct his answer when it was wrong. So, i just gave him to correct it by himself. Then, Kevin was mad at me because he thought i shouldn't do that. Most of my classmates said i was so dumb to do that~! I won't do that anymore and I won't check his quizes or tests anymore........At last, Kevin forgive me... thanks...kevin... Our Chemistry teacher, Mr.Stephenson was so mad today too because he didn't like any of his students slept in his class.

       I   went to downtown Vancouver with homestay this morning. Joanne and Ingrid were together with us too. First we went to " Queen Elizabeth park" to view the various flowers. And we took few pictures there too. Then we went to the shade of a tree to have our lunch picnic. I had a ham and cheese sandwich, orange juice, a plum and a peach. Healthy food, huh?Then we went to the city of Vancouver which was a lot of Asian people. We had fun in the window shopping of Robson street. After that, We went home at 4:00pm. We have no school tomorrow, yeah~! well, tomorrow is my study day so nothing to be happy... haahaa~!      I was in a bad mood today... Maybe I will go to Australia after a year... I miss Canada... ai...... In order to my future, I have to study there...       I have to completely focus in English~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Get a load of me,   Get a load of you,   Walking down the street   And I hardly know you   It's just like we were meant to be      Holding hands with you,   When we're out at night,   Got a girlfriend   You say it isn't right,   And I've got someone waiting too.      what if this is just the beginning   We're already wet and we're gonna go swimming      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you   Its inevitable... it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it   So tell me...   Why can't I breathe whenever i think about you      Isn't this the best part of breaking up   Finding someone else you can't get enough of   Someone who wants to be with you too      Its an itch we know we are gonna scratch    Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch   But wouldn't it be beautiful?      Here we go we're at the beginning    we haven't fucked yet, but my head's spinning      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you   It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it   So tell me   Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you      High enough for you to make me wonder   Where it's goin'High enough for you to pull me under   Somethin's growin'   Out of this that we can control   Baby I am dyin'      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever talk about you      Whenever i think about you

       It's amazing how you Can speak right to my heart Without saying a word You can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing The smile on your face Let's me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand Says you'll catch me if ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all All day long I can hear People talking out loud But when you hold me near You drown out the crowd Old Mr. Webster could never define What's being said between your heart and mine The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in you eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand Says you'll catch me If ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me If ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all

       Last night, i chatted with Ring who was my HOng kong's friend. She and I haven't chatted for ages, I miss her very much... and i miss my sweet home~ :'( serious homesick... This morning was rainning, I got all wet even i had my umbrella...urgh...Today i got tons of homework and tests because summer school still have three days to go. I caught the bus beside my school and it would be arriving there at 12:20pm only 5 mins later after my school at 12:15pm. I rushed to the bus stop, fortunately the bus was waiting for me too. I went to "Save on food" and bought my commodities. Then, I went to Library for internet...about 15 mins later, I walked home. It was a far far way to home and I walked and sweated... Those items were so heavy too...ai.......Finally, I got home... Tomorrow I will go to Library with Sherry for the Chemistry project...

       Nothing special for Today... My mood same as the weather today... Cloudy and rainy~ I went to Library at 5 today and start my small Chemistry Project... I will be so busy in these two days because summer school is gonna over soon... My average.................ai..............don't wanna mention it... Despress for today~ :'( After I left Library, I went to coffee shop to have my Mocha and cheese cake. I don't know why the mocha tasted bitter. I usually drink Mocha was tasted sweet... Mybe it was because I got a bad mood today.      Why god has to give me that sadness and it took me for a long time in this sadness...   When will it gone, when will i get rid of it?   I am really suffering in these few months...please..... don't play me... I don't want to have this game...

       Little faith, brightens are rainy day Life is difficult you can go away Don't hide yourselves in a corner You have my place to stay ã Sorrow is gonna say goodbye Opens up you see the happy sunshine Keep going on with your dream Chasing tomorrow sunrise The spirit can never dead ã Sun will shine my friend Won't let you cry my dear Seeing you, share the tear Make my woe disappear You never be alone in darkness ã Ssee my smile my friend We are with you holding hands You have God to believe You are my destiny We meant to be your friends That's what a friend should be
