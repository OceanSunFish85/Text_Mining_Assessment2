      i love my cows.they look  cute and spastic  which is so like me :) and the whole layout is so bright :)  i forgot to put in money in my wallet(which is  extremely empty)  so i had not even a  single cent   to eat and my handphone too.It was okayy as i had brought  tuna .yea.but i forgot to bring the  bread .so ended up eating from the can of tuna and it taste so salty.still, it was nice and filling for a reccess :)      so had speech training during reccess.i am sick of my role!!!i feel disgusted  gazing lovingly  at nicole all the time (i think i grossed nicole out too) art was pretty interesting with carin going on and on about kim.she sure hates her ALOT.      then had training.ouchh.i am having stomach cramps from all the pt.well, it was more like dance lesson no. 2. considering all the stretches we did.yayy.i like playing doubles with leyi :)       i need to fatten my taggie.i am so jealous of its figure now.yiling please help me with my screwed taggie!!!

      wheeee!!! cross country was  CANCELLED  due to heavy downpour!!  well,wasn't really excited anyway.supposed to buy gummies and walk together with seline.it sounded more like a leisure stroll with food and the usual talk :)  school is pretty interesting today.watch some communist show with carin making all the funny remarks :) then yicky screened infernal affairs for us!!!thanks sylvia for bringing the disc  so after school went to far east to eat the delicious chicken rice with  the newly weds, best man and flower girl.  (i'm the bridesmaid!!!:)). took some newly weds neos and was about to go when nicole's mum called us to tell us about the stormy weather conditions.dearest seline had called to tell me that the race WAS CANCELLED!!!:) then it was followed by lots of confirmation calls...blah blah blah...we deceided to walk to heeren and beloved carin left us halfway through.aww.  tingyu is so  gullible !!she spent like so much time on the phone trying to tell whether her teammates were tricking her about the race still being on.after that someone paged for her to meet at the women's accersories section and her whole team appered to follow her!!!nicole and andris were trying to escape from tingyu(since the team was only following tingyu) and they left me behind with tingyu and her whole team!!!yea.somehow they left us and we went back to tingyu's sweetheart andris who was hiding together with nicole. went window shopping for a while before getting tired and taking a break at mcdonalds.then we still wanted to stay so tingyu and me thought of a wonderful story to tell to nicole's mum to persuade her to let nicole stay with us x).walked and looked around for nicole's mum present while dicussing about what to wear for speech training.yayy!!andris and i have the same taste!!!so the theme for the 3 bimbos would be  classy and elegant with glitter and butterfly prints !!!  after that went over to j8 while andris went home.the 3 of us went around squishing all the toys *grins* n icole is violent too!!!BEWARE!!! bwahahaha.walked around for a bit before tingyu's father came to fetch us.thank you my sexy and super sweet tingyu for offering me a ride home!!!btw, tingyu's sister is so much like tingyu!!!  oh.li jia wei got into the semi finals!!! 75% medal hope  for singapore!!!feeling so happy now!!my legs are aching so i better go sleep and wake up again to watch olympics!!i'm hooked on it!:)

      i'm so angry at that irritating north korean t.t player.  she has been screaming like a banshee throughout the whole game!!!!!!!!!!according to huizhuang,she sounded like a   chicken being raped    sniffsniff.now the chance for silver and gold is gone.hope that li jia wei can clinch bronze.ahhhh!!!she played so well!!!! thrashed the nkorean 11-0  x) too bad she din get in!!!!!!i was throwing the seeds of the rambutans i ate at the tv(in the nkorean's face)  now in no mood to do anything.we should start mourning and skip school on monday if she din get bronze.or maybe wear all black as it would be " sad day for lijiawei and singapore ".sighhhhhh  oh yea.read what mj and audrey said.made me laughed so hard:  MJ:  but nvm!!! she and susilo will get married and live happily ever after!!  MJ:  train together and live together with one another for support!!! -----------    MJ : i bet she's talknig on the phone with ronald  Audrey : hehe      Audrey : no lah  Audrey:  ronald maybe there already  Audrey : to hug her  Audrey : and ronald will ask: "are you alright?"  Audrey : then lijiawei: "wo hai hao"     Audrey:  but since they're both learning chinese and english now respectively,  Audrey : i believe ronald will ask in a english accent:"ni hai hao ma?"  Audrey : then lijiawei will speak in a cheena accent,"i'm alright"  Audrey : she knows broken english  Audrey : haha         Audrey : really so cute right  Audrey : one speak english the other speak chinese the children will be bilingual   Audrey : like alexteo and angweeling  Audrey : they converse lidat lor  ---------------------------  WAHAHAHAHAH.audrey is cute :)
