						   If we stick to the normally accepted diatribe, we find the Capitalism (a.k.a. Democracy, the West) clearly hasnât all the answers â on the other hand, clearly Socialism (a.k.a. Communism, Maoist, the East), really couldnât cut it either. Since September the 11th, our awareness has changed, our markets went into upheaval, our lives, whether you were in the USA or not, were affected globally, fear, unemployment, etc â you probably know the story.   Throughout history, brilliant ideas and various forms of ââismsâ have come into being and out, into vogue and out but sadly or fortunately, none have really stood the test of time. Additionally, people have fought and died for these ââismsâ, only to have the ââismâ itself die some time later, only to be replaced by another.  So what is this all about? What is this, yet-another-diatribe for?  I wrote this after collecting some thoughts as I became slowly interested in economics. Over time as I learned more about it, I became completely and utterly disillusioned.   To put it simply, there are gaping holes in both systems â the theories and ideas backing both are completely flawed â and one of the most easiest to identify flaws, one of the most evident problems of both systems is influence of people.  Uncontrolled capitalism creates itâs own enemies â those left out or omitted or left-behind, will strike-back â unfortunately this is an historical fact. Weâve seen it recently. The people not included hit back at the âevilâ that kept them down. Right or wrong, good or bad, and why for are really irrelevant â maybe human nature, who knows.

						   Trying to write a job application and damn thing falls-over all the time.  German is hard enough for a native speaker, but writing twenty plus pages in the language and then having disappear in seconds is beyond frustrating. Not even aa backup.  (frustration) .................  W.
