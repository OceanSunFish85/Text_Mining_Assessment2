        so.        i've seen napoleon dynamite twice already, and i STILL don't understand what the point of that movie is. it's hilarious, don't get me wrong but... i mean.. where's the plot? hell, i've seen anchorman three times and i still can't find a plot. but it's the funniest movie i've ever seen.            mmmmmmmmg i spent all my money last week to buy a tube top with jim morrison on it. i think it was well worth the $20 and 3 hours i spent at the mall. love the doors. or die.        saturday we're going to the beach. son of a beach! i LOVE the beach! even texas beaches! dirty and gross water... mmmm love it!!            but all i really do is check out guys. well, not anymore. i used to. but it's not like anything happened with that anyway. like i'd ever get noticed. pshh.        so i got a new email address.. to forget about how i came up with kgartenppants. i'd rather forget that whole phase of my life. and that's what it was- a phase. i grew up and out of that phase. finally.                welllllllllllllllllll now i'm just bored. someone leave a comment.            i'm so sad. amanda says she hates me. that she's never met me but she just hates me. i cried. she really has no reason to hate me. if anything, i'm the one with the reason. but yeah, i cried and cried and cried.. and i'm so sad she doesn't like me...        hah oh wait.. i'm confusing the word "cry" with "laugh". and "sad" with "happy".        gah i hate it when i do that! i get a little confused.            :) I LOVE BRIAN :)

       does it bother anyone else that traci townsend spells the word "psyched" as "syked"?.....is it just me?... maybe cuz my mama's an english major.. i dunno, it bothers me tho         my new favorite band seems to be my chemical romance. and my new favorite thing to do seems to be yelling at people from out of a car window. hey it's fun, try it sometime. especially if you pass some chicks with their windows down and you yell "heeeeey ladies!!"... and you're a girl. oh they love that!          ...................................           checkers are so awesome. hmg. i wish i could checker my entire car. but. anyway. check you!. later.
