      well tonite was kewl, when christine came over. i miss her so much. but tonite i went and got my ben and jerry's cookie dough ice cream, and i watched my movies with christine. and thats what i always do when im depressed, only this time it helped! so i called scott at 9:30 and thats when he just walked in the door from work, and he was like im going to a grad. party so ill call you later, i was like you promise, and he said yeah. sure enough he called me back at like 1am. and we talked for like 45 min. only cuz he was hella tired and had football all day tomorrow! but we got to talking about the online thing, and he said the only reason he hasnt called me is b/c he thought i was mad at him and plus hes been working like crazy. and we cleared things up between us, and hes not mad at me and were good, although he said he was joking about some things that i didnt think were funny, so i dunno if he was joking or not. but i trust him enough.OMG!!! when i was on the phone w/ scott at like 1:30, my bed shook, and so did scotts house, and my friend ed's house, there was an earthquake and on the rickter scale it was at 4.5 out of 10 and 8 is considered to be serious damage! so that was freaky! well im gunna go to bed, just wanted you to know life is good again!   ~goodnite~

      Tonite was bad too. i was talking to my friend alex whos friends with scott, and scott was going over to his house to hang out, and i called his house and told his lil brother to tell him i called when he got off of work. and he never called me.but i went shopping w/ my mom and grandma(they buy me shit, so i said why not lol) and so i put my away message up when i left and i guess my dad clicked out of my away message and so scott though i was online you know, and he was like oh are we not talking to me now, so i asked my friend alex what was up with him, and he was like yeah i guess scott is mad at you cuz you didnt talk to him and you were ignoring him. and so if hes mad at me for that, hes got another thing coming to him, he hasnt called me in like 4 days. after messing around w/ me, what kind of message do you think that sends out?..exactly a one nite stand, and i know he wouldnt do that to me. so i dunno. i just really hope this isnt a big joke that hes playing. you know whats its like to have no one like you? and at the same time thinking someone is playing a joke on you, think of it as if someone were dumping you but at the same time you were getting stabed. yeah the fix of the 2 sux's! and scott, if your reading this call me. im not mad at you and i really wish you would let me know whats going on between us!    ~good nite~ i hope my day is great tomorrow! *wish me tons of luck*

      Tonite was the worst nite ever.I was so scared! but it is my own fault. I called this guy who i have never met to hang out, i was bored and my mom was getting home at like 11 ish, so i wanted to go out as my last nite of freedom, so called this guy up who lived in west chicago, omg what was i thinking! and we went to his work place and he liked me and i just wanted to hang out cuz i like scott, but i was bored cuz scott couldnt go out tonite. so when we got to his work(he owned the place) i felt so uncomfortable. I honestly thought that i was gunna get raped, and i just anted to get outta ther SO bad! i wanted Scott SOOO bad! and i never went near him, and he kept getting mad at me for me not hitting on him, and i wouldnt! and so i asked him to drive me to my friends house who lived like a block away form me, so the only way i could get him to take me there was to sit by him. and i did but then he was like your being rude and shit and i was so scared. when he droped me off at my friends house there was some of my other friends like carolyn,ellie,astra and christine(her house) and 2 guys wich carolyn and christine worked with and we were just hangin out and having fun, i had to be home at 11....yeah, didnt make it. lol i got home at 12:10 ish and my mom was like why didnt you call, and its kewl i talked my way out of it! and when i got home i was so scared, cuz some other person was smoking and i didnt want my mom to think i was. but its all gravy baby! cuz i used her tooth brush cuz i had taken a puff, cuz i had never tried it b4 and so my breath smelt. And one of the guys asked for my number and i was like uhh, sure why? i was like i like someone though and he was all like thats ok and used my phone. but hey its kewl im home now. darn! but ill never talk to that kid i never met again! Plus he was ugly as fuck, and fat and smelly. lol thats why i like scott, hes ABSOLUTLY none of those, hes HOTT!, with 2 t's lol, nice ass body! and always smells good! but bad news i didnt get to see scot at all today, and he probably wont call me tonite. I know why too probably. cuz when he droped me off, he didnt get home till like 11:20, meaning he was 20 min late, i feel SOO bad! but its kewl, once he gets over to his dads house i can come over whenever i want, cuz his dad likes me!! ~goodnite~

      Tonite was probably the best nite of the week.Today was ok, i cleaned the pool and then went out to dinner with my g-ma, ken(her friend) and ken's daughter(shes like 40) and then i was gunna go hang out w/ Scott(this is where my nite got good) and he called me when we were at dinner saying that he didnt have a baseball game anymore so we could hang ou tat his house. So he picked me up at like 8:30, so we got to his house at 9 ish, but you see there is a down side, he had to be home at 11, meaning we had to leave at 10:15. And i didnt care how long i got to see him for, all that mattered is that i got to see him, and boy was he HOTT! with 2 t's lol and i asked him if i was cute, he gave me a 15 out of 10 lol i thought that was cute... im no to one to kiss and tell, so i wont!(thats all im saying hehe) i kinda mat his stepdad, i sw him for like a split second when i was leaving, cuz we were in the basement, and his stepdad was upstairs when we came in. And i was like i dont want tonite to be the only nite i see you and then have you get mad at me cuz all you wanted was action or whatever, and he said i know, thats why im having you over tomorrow during the day to go swimming! i was like awwww lol but thats about it. DAM i just realized that my mom gets back tomorrow. damit! i LOVE not having my parents around, thats why i liked being in Vegas w/ out them and also why i wanted to stay longer. Who honestly wants to be around their parents everyday, not me thats for sure, its nice to take a break away from them, try it!! but anywho! lol im gunna go upstairs and try to sneak out and go do something, its so boaring here and my g-ma is in bed and its only like 11:30 so ill ttyl ~good nite~

      Today is just like yesterday. You know how i was hoping to see Scott today..guess what? uh uh didnt happen. he got in a lot of trouble with his mom and he cant do anything, so the latest i would get to see him would be the weekend. Which sucks b/c i want to hang out when my parents arent home. I like having freedom. So i have done nothing all day i went to bed at 8 am and woke up at 3pm and since then done nothing! and i miss britt so much! right now we'd be out and having fun with hot guys lol well so far i was right about glen ellyn, its boaring and i knew once i got back from Vegas i wouldnt have any fun at all, if only i could predict when i could see Scott again. That would be tyte! So last night i was talking to my "friend" jamie and he was telling me how he was mad at me for what happened between me and my ex. And he was just making me so mad that i wanted to kill myself, and i tried to last night, but it didnt work cuz i loved my sister too much! and i wanted to see scott, and all this stuff. i cnt wait till im 18, im moving out after my senior year to cali! and im living with Britt, my best friend in the world! were like sisters, and shes the only one i have felt that close to. Shes like family to me, ive known her since i was 2. and when i left her saturday the 20th, it was honestly very hard for me. i cnt get over it, i miss her so much, and just being around her has made me want to be more like her, shes my idol, that may sound wierd, but i have changed since i got back form Vegas, ive become a better person, someone more like...Britt! well ill write more later but for now i think im gunna go find something to do!                         </post></Blog>
