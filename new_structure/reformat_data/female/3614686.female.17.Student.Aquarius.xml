      i sick and tired hearing DGT all kind of nonsense, ohh please cant u all just forgive and forget those unhappy stuff and just get back as it was..  u all not tired of quarrelling arh....so bo liao loh and now becoz of idol stuff u all became like this...  if you all continue to be like that...i have a idea...just spilt up man..no use to be together loh...like this u all will be better what dun need to see each other de black face m i right...  DGT are all pamper kids...u all should know...  maybe u are the younger or the most pamper child at home..but it does not mean that the other oso must treat you like what your parent did to you...i saying all of them including myself ok...  you all better change ur character loh...if you don't like someone to shout at you....same to other members, you don;t like de other also loh...  if other member are trying to get back the relationship between us why don't u all accept it....  and please be more mature..there thing u can say..there thing u can't even mention a words ok..if those words you know that will hurt the relationship u shuld not mention anything about it...  whatever u all unhappy with yap....u can write in ur PRIVATE BLOG but not those blog that all the member can view..ok   EVERYONE HAVE DIFF IDEA....MAYBE U HAVE SOME IDEA TOO...BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERYONE MUST USE YOUR IDEA...EVERYONE MUST FOLLOW YOUR IDEA...U THINK IT RIGHT..BUT NOT EVERYONE THINK THAT OK...  I WROTE ALL THIS NOT TO MAKE THE RELASTIONSHIP WORST...I JUZ WANT ALL OF THEM TO THINK ABT IT...IF YOU ALL CONTINUE THAT...THERE IS NUTTING MORE FOR US AS A GROUP...

      I finally got a dream..i now given myself a target of 6 years to  learn piano,guitar and composing..i learn that not becoz i want to become a singer....is i really want my music to be shared wif everyone...around me...maybe during the 6 years of sinking deep into music..alot of ppls will disagree wif me...but i going to be very stubborn this time round in music...i not going to give up..and not going to bother anyone who stop my way...  I love what Hins Zhang wrote in his song "Sheng Yin"   éæ¾ä½ çè²é³ éé²ä½ çæ(å¿)æ æå±¬æ¼ä½ çæäº å±çµ¦æ¯ä¸åäººè½GO æä¸ç´å¨èè½ è¦ç¨æè²è­æ ç¾å¨ä½ å°±æ¯æèç¼çææ å¥è®å¤ªå¤å°é£è¿·æäºä½ çç¼ç å å®çä¿¡å¿µå¦å½±é¨å½¢  é³æ¨ä¸ä¸å®è½è®èª°è®æææ åªè¦ä½ ç¨äºå¿(ç¨äºå¿) å°±ææççææ ä½ è¦ç¨ä½ çå¿åè²é³ æåæ¯ä¸åå¿é ä½ è¦ç¨ä½ çå¿å»èè½ æ¯åè§è½çè²é³ ä½ è¦ç¨ä¿¡å¿  åæ¢å»é¢å°è·¯çé«ä½ä¸å¹³ é¨éå°±æå¤©çå å¼·åªååè¡ ä½ è¦ç¨ä½ çå¿åè²é³ æåæ¯ä¸åå¿é ä½ è¦ç¨ä½ çå¿å»èè½ æ¯åè§è½çè²é³ é³æ¨çè²é³ è½åä½å¤©ç©ºæéäº®çæµæ è¦ä½ ç¨å¿èè½ç¨çå¿ææ   That the passion toward music...  i going to change my lifestyle of chasing idol totally...coz i dont want to waste any more time....  after getting my school time-table i going to plan my schedule for my music lesson...i have to work very hard for what i aiming now and then...i don't wish to be slacker any more coz i ord find my dream...  anyway even i sank very deep into music...dun worry of my study i going to study hard too...i will plan my time properly...  Anyway the last step of stepping into music was either to Lee Wei Song School of Music or The Music Clinic to learn Composing...
