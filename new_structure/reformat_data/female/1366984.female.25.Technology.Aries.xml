						   Uggghhnn...small red post saying that I feel achy. Been cooking my brain outside today. I've been studying in the garden. Should never do that again. I forget time, don't register anything, and the sun keeps on cooking me!  I'm red now. I have to go kajaking in some hours, and have to face the sun again. I don't know if it's wise, but I love my Kajak.  Someone tried to start a fire today...and I came to the conclusion that I must sufer from pyromania. Someone had obviously enjoyed a cigarette. And left it on the dry grass. I was lying there, after finishing my studies, and juuust wanted to relax. I was REALLY enjoying life and the birds were singing, my body was feeling all numb from the sun, I was gettign so tired and sleepy by the wind caresing my face...when I turned, it was there! Smoke was coming out of the grass!!  I did   nothing! Just looked at it and observed it, while the smoke was rising up the air. The smoke was getting white and thick. I looked how it danced up it way into the amazingly beautiful, bright blue sky. I was fascinated of the structure of the smoke, although my heart raced wildly, since I knew this probably wasn't good. I was devouring the smell of burnt grass or what reminded me of wood. The smell took my right back to excursions in the wood, where one had to try to start a bonfire.  All of sudden the smoke stopped. The cigarette had finished burning and I was left with an empty sensation of loneliness-I had attached myself to the burning cigarette..I had had all these strange visions in my head of sirens, ambulance, firedepartments hunky guys and my flat burning and people yelling. A little 9/11 scenario in this little suburb of Copenhagen.  I was kinda disappointed that nothing had happened, that the vision of me being the Cigarette hero, pouring my last drops of water onto the dangerous little butt of cigarette, had vanished in thin air.  Then I wondered if all those previous toxines from my early smokingdays, really had me all screwed up?  Smoking really IS bad for you...

						   ..Is the one, which tells you immediately, what the outcome will be: Good food, bad husband, horror able dinner, acing a test, bad sex, insanely demented neighbours... the last thing is an issue of mineâ¦  Insanely demented neighbours.  I donât know how, I just knew it: The first second said it all. Their Clampetyclamp annoying way of walking, their pathetic 4 sec. Lovemaking with no cuddle or talk, and their nocturnal journeys into an obvious extended version of Narnia. Then I knew, I would get problems with them. To be exactly: 4 years!  Why didnât I do anything at that point? Well, Iâm still struggling with the issue of why? Why havenât I yelled, screamed, knocked down their door â or just simply killed them? I blame it on my insecurity. When I moved in four years ago, I was a pleaser! Hello â My name is Isabel, and I am a Pleaser. Not that I am recklessly rude now and saying all that I feel and think of, Iâm just more balanced now (says the insane woman behind the computerJ) But I used to say nothing â absolutely NOTHING. People could smear me in honey and place under a tree with little aggressive creatures going BZZZbzzzZZ and I would just stand there and smile, knowing that I would swell up like a balloon. I would of course look at the bright side, in a desperate attempt of denial, probably going âuhm, that honey is delicious â is it Lilly of the valley Honey?â Get my point? This would probably be a terrific case for Dr.Phil!   Well, now Iâm here, numb because Iâm so angry that I feel nothing except my nerves, which just popped out on my skinâ¦Theyâre moving furniture AGAIN! Apparently theyâre in this cult saying âmove furniture every night or you wonât receive the embrace of Godâ. I doubt theyâd ever do that no matter how many furniture they move. I mean, we live in this magnificent century, so many beautiful and practical things have been invented (or stolen), like, uhm, lets say those padded things to put under the chairs!!! Theyâre not made because your chairsâ little feet are freezing! Itâs because some chairs do make noise when moving them across a hard wooden floor (and it also protects them)!  I donât even know when or how to begin this blog, itâs already a messâ¦like my life, because of them. At least so it feels -  I know a bit dramatic, but exaggeration enhances the true meaning of things.  In my fantasy a casual conversation with the neighbours would sound something like this:   Well, lets start with the beginning or something like that. I donât remember when it started; graduately it has become worse with time. In the beginning it was just some clompetyclomp, not much to say, since it was sometimes not often and I got to sleep the whole night. I have a standard that says that if I can sleep all night, nothing bad has happened. I can deal with the whole world, with a perfect nightâs of sleep. I havenât slept for 1 whole year now!!! You live right above me, and itâs an old flat, everything CAN be heard in the first place, but one could seek to minimize the noise. So, when the bathroom is being used it can be heard, the sneezing, talking, coughing, even walking hard with elephant shoes on the wooden floors can be heard, so maybe- just maybe and this must be insane of me to suggest: TRY TAKING OFF YOUR SHOES to start with for a change, it might help! You used to be only one, and sometimes your âsailorâ would come home. Thatâs my I named him sailor; he was only there in the Summerâ¦And THAT could be heard at night. Which is fine, coz it only lasts 4 seconds, but the BANGING of your bed against the wall, lasts for 10 and thatâs a bloody long time considering itâs 2 AM in the morning! And I have to get up early. As I mentioned, my sleep is tremendously important to me. I only want it disturbed by 3 reasons:  1)	Thereâs a fire in my house, or a natural disaster has occurred RIGHT outside my window (which is highly unlikely, since itâs Denmark I live in) 2)	My belly is hungry 3)	My boyfriend wants sex  Otherwise I really donât want to be disturbed!  Now, Every bloody night, I have to wait for you insane people to finish off your 3 hours marathon in a flat, which is only 58 SQM, before I am ALLOWED to fall asleep myself and thatâs why I ask you, if you have Narnia in your closet??  Which is strange, come to think of it. Because during the daytime thereâs usually not much coming down from you. Veeery quiet, like youâre waiting for the clock to show 10 in the evening, because then BAM..you get up and start running like wild horses through the entire flat. AAAaaand you donât stop until it is passed midnight! Moving furniture dragging in obscure elephants from the closet of Narnia, and out into your flat, pretending no one lives under you and generally having a blast. I really envy you. I really wish I could do the same. But I canât. Iâm stuck in my frustration and anger, and the beginning of  an ulcer which I really enjoy nurturing and caring forâ¦ohh, and not to mention all these pimples Iâm getting from the stress Iâm being put through. Not the mental stressâ¦the sleep deprivation stress. I canât shut yo out, I canât just pretend not hearing you. Itâs like an ant standing in front of an elephant goingâ what, I donât see anythingâ scenario. Not even the most experienced meditator, would be able to handle these people. Why is it that you can tell that a person is mental by the way heâs walking?  Why walk with the heels, when Man has been created with such an anatomical (and practical) feature as feet! I might be feet obsessed, but I believe theyâre there for a reason â not abuse! And then the lack of common sense. Apparently, either your parents are heavenly retarded as well, or youâre doing all this on purpose because of reasons beyond my comprehension, or you simple lack that little genome called âCommon senseâ.  And thenâ¦this is typical Danish, but WHY, oh WHY clean up your house once a month, and then have it so disgustingly dirty, that you are obliged to take a WHOLE WEEK OFF just to clean it up, because your boyfriendâs parents are coming over for 4 hours to celebrate his birthday? Now how do I know all this? Not because Iâm in the CIA. I saw you last week, cleaning windows at 8:30 in the evening, coming home from an evening stroll. During that whole week, you have been vacuum cleaning EVERY DAY for 3 days, you have been scrubbing at 8:30 in the evening your floors, walls, kitchen, ah, what the heck, your whole flat! They sang the birthday song going up the stairs, and then. the lovely symphony of chairs scraping against the floors AGAIN for 30 minutes, because apparently it takes 30 minutes to accommodate your huge arse on the chair!  Well, of course, I donât speak, but I speak in silenceâ¦Music on loudly in the morning, because since you get to bed late, you get up late too..BUT I DONâT! That really frustrates you. That and Sarah Brightman. Once, you had the nerve to come down, to tell me to lay off the music, because youâre watching TV. Oh, we all bow for the Princess. Well, for us mortals it is easy to see if one comes in genuine and humble asking for a favor attitude or that ratatouille stuck-up appearance of â I rule the world, and the world evolves around meâ attitude. You collected the last one. But it was unfair, because at that time 7 in the evening, I still had the right to play music on loudly. After eight itâs forbidden. You on the other hand, infest my atmosphere, because that is what you indeed do, when you refuse to give me some proper SLEEP!  And then youâre dragging me down to your level, by playing loud music in the morning (which Iâm also entitled to). And then you try to be so STUPID, that you play loud music, in what you call 8:30 in the morning (that is afternoon for me). But you only have time to play for about half a minute and then you have to be off for workâ¦how pity.. And then again. Iâm also pity for spending 3 pages on an obvious mentally insane person. But at least Iâm doing this, opening the valve with hot air. Because in the end, these are just words, passing through like air. IF you grasp them Iâve accomplished what I wanted; a little of your attention, and even if itâs just fragments of words you remember, they are there; your mind registered the words, and I will not be forgotten.  I still find your way of life immensely sad. Although thinking of it, mine is too. Iâm writing all this to two people I most likely wonât talk to. And why? Because deep down inside, it all comes down to that second. That second of hesitation, that second of insecurity, that second when you feel in your gut it will bring trouble, that second where spontaneity was replaced by thoughts, that true and only second of pleasingâ¦
