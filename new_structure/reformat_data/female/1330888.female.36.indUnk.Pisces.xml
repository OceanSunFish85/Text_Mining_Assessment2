      Somedays they amaze me. How grown up they are My keepers and I theirs Once so little and helpless Now blooming into their own What would I do if I didn't have them... Where would I be ... Life would not be the same. My heart burns for them,  with love and worry Wanting them to be safe and happy Never wanting to let go. They are mine forever..  One thing I will always have.. Is their love.Forever.

      In my mind , thoughts wonder in and out of reality Aimlessly floating , causing grief, confusion and pain In my mind memories haunt me. Torturing scenes from my childhood into adulthood Every choice and decision made, taunting me relentlessly In my mind, I talk to myself, asking rebounding questions  Never satisfied with the answer In my mind is a constant battle with myself Do this, you should of done that... why didn't you.... A never winning scenario.... In my mind is a mind of many and mind lost to itself.

      Another day gone by... started out shitty and didn't get much better. I should just go to bed and stay there... my safe haven... sleep , pillow and blanket.   Ah... to sleep is to escape.  In the night, my soul wonders free To search out the new and forget about the past In the night, my heart is free to feel  To open up and engulf all the wonders of the world In the night, my mind escapes and journeys to far off places Experiencing all and everything, without guilt or shame In the night, my body is at rest  Self healing, young and beautiful..full of grace. Ah ... to sleep and never wake.  One day , One day.

      Well here we go.. My mind is full and ready to burst. Let's just say I'm having one of those days where I wonder if I've made the right choices in my life, my once marriage, divorce (the choices that went along with it) AND EVERYTHING SINCE THEN. My life has been a whirlwind... for everything that has happened it's all be a choice , a reaction or done in defense. At 35, a mother of 3 kids, ( 13, 11  10 ) in a serious relationship ( I think ) and still feeling the weight of past relationships. I guess I carry things to close to heart and ALWAYS over analize. Why do we do the things that we do?? Creatures of nature they say... or just scared and grasping, I say. Afraid of being alone and afriad of making the tough choices. Do we always opt for the easy way out? I really wonder sometimes. Nothing is ever easy in life.... it hasn't been for me. If I wanted a scape goat I could blame my upbringing... but I don't and won't. I survived and think  ..THINK I came out of it ok. I guess reflection is a self cleansing thing...  I guess. I wonder if I'm steering my childern in the right direction...I see my self and the choices I made in them all the time. I sit here , with a banging headache, sore from working out and feeling very empty at the moment. So needy I can be , wanting to be loved and wanting attention,but then to be left alone to do my thing... what ever that is. Screwed in the head maybe... or is this normal you tell me.........Please.

      Sitting in the dark with only my computer keeping me company.  Music to soothe my soul , making the time fly by I take a deep breath trying to clear my mind... What lies a head of me is endless..Every day is the same  What a routine we live in Cooking , cleaning trying to keep everyone happy Oh what we moms do for love Waiting for the thank yous and the hugs  Smiles and kisses keep us going It's the little things that count... We rant and rave sometimes.. trying to be heard. Mostly out of frustration. Tired are we that run the house. Feeling unappreciated and part of the furniture What a grand life we lead.

      Lost in a sea of ever changing emotion the dark sky looming in my fear of loneliness all but drowned by mistrust and no devotion swept away by the bleeding heart , crushed and broken What's to save me...  An Island of warmth and security? a lovers arm wrapped around me? Those would be ideal, but lost I am  Until the sun breaks through once again  And the passion of it's Love frees me.

      Tornado events take my energy away A rollercoaster of never ending Thrills  Chills. To maintian is the goal and not to lose control Even when face to face with a hater who's so fake Being the better person and not to give in Or atleast know when to shut my mouth , making it all end Not take it personally when being ignored I'm standing my ground I will not go through that door Rationalizing their problem , only to make myself feel better Can you see me, can you hear me... I am right beside you I am not a ghost , I do exsist ...can you not see my clinched fist? Should I yell or scream..or should I cry Your power struggle will leave you behind. Open your eyes.. are you so blind?

      Lost in the sound of haunting music Dream like visions past me by The rythmn is hynotic My eyes close and I lose myself Swaying to the music My body eludes me Swimming in the lyrics I become one with the song Beating is my heart  Keeping time , pounding out of my chest. I can't breathe.. I'm victim to the tempo Swirling and twirling endlessly Darkness takes me.. the song is over.

      Word's of true wisdom ( see previous entry ) Feeling like shit lately.. the only time I feel good is when we're playing racquet ball and I can sweat every bad thing out of my body. Work is stressful and tense.. Another big change and people scared for their jobs. Me? Yes and no.. I don't wna to lose my job , but if I have no choice and I get laid off... well then I guess I make the best of it. I am excited to go back to Heritage. It's likre going home.. closer to my kids and my old stompin' grounds. The weather sucks too.. finally a weekend with no plans. maybe some nice quiet time at home with my love. Maybe take in a movie. That would be nice.. Financial stress had been getting the best of us.. with the bi-weekly pay  now in full swing, making sure our bills our paid, food in the freezer and gas and his support paid.... there is nothing left. I think we are finally getting the hang of it. Vacation is soon .. 4 weeks... I can't wait. Sun , sand and Shane  I. Who knows what  we'll be coming home too... work wise that is.. The BIG move is July , the first or second week. Who knows who will be moving and who won't...... Too many changes. To find something else.. may be a task all in itself. Pay cut comes to mind.. starting over.... Not a good idea. Maybe I'll just hang out and see what happens. I've had 2 nights with out all kinds of extra running... the kids schedules are wearing me down. I love watching them play ball... Proud momma for sure.  A true balance is the goal of my happiness.... how to get there is the question at hand.   Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity  To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment  Would you capture it or just let it slip?   Good question..........................till we meet again. May the dark wings embrace you and give you the security of it's love.

       Mindi's Sun Sign is Pisces ...          Romantic Pisces, you are the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac. You are regarded as the sign of sensitivity and receptivity, and are a true chameleon by being mutable and infinitely complex. Your keywords are communion and vision, and you have the capacity to go beyond this world to the one of dreams and the spirit.  Your ruler Neptune, the planet of confusion and chaos, gets people out of habits that imprison them so that they question themselves and can discover another path toward growth and spirituality. Neptune is also the planet of imagination and illusion, and governs the dream world with all its many facets.  Pisces is the third of the three water signs, Mindi, which means that you are concerned with the realm of emotion and feeling. You deal with sensitivity, intuition, and deeper psychic aspects of life. You are able to conduct unconscious telepathic communication with others.  Your sign rules the twelfth house of the chart, the sector associated with the unconscious, need for seclusion, and places of restriction. This house describes the wellspring of your being, including psychological problems that you repress. This house is very healing and can promote personal and spiritual growth, once you make the effort to go deeper and face YOUR reality.  Pisces is a mutable sign. You adapt to the exigencies of life and ingeniously melt into circumstances like a chameleon. In your interaction with others, you are personable and compassionate, and successfully connect on a deep emotional level.  Your strengths, Mindi, lie in your altruistic and empathetic nature, because you feel the urge to help people less fortunate than you. Your sensitivity and intuition make you a true healer. Your strong imagination and highly evolved creativity predispose you to artistic expression.  Your main weaknesses are that you can be weak-willed, passive, and indecisive. Many times, you prefer to escape reality and indulge in your dreamworld. Chaos and confusion can be present in you, which may frustrate your circle of friends. At the same time, you can be oversensitive and fragile, feeling victimized by others.                   Your Rising Sign is Aries ...         As an Aries Rising, Mindi, you face the world with intense energy and primal power. You always look to go beyond your own limits and outdo yourself with every step. With each challenge, you learn more about yourself, and gain additional confidence to go even farther on your next adventure. Your incredible decisiveness enables you to act on your ideas the minute you form them. You don't have time to waste! You are very competitive and have a strong urge to excel in whatever you do, and you continually prove your power through action.  The downside is that you can be quite impulsive, Mindi, and often make decisions too hastily for your own good. Once you've made a decision, it's difficult for you to go back and reconsider, because you only know how to move in one direction in life, and that is straight ahead.  It's no easy task to make someone like you back down. This irreversible strength you have inside allows you to thrive in some of the most powerful and influential positions in the business world, the ones in which the important decisions are made. If you have stopped climbing, it's probably because you've already reached the top. It's as simple as that!  Since you are extremely ambitious and outgoing, Mindi, you don't quail at social climbing in order to make your dreams come true. Once in a while, you may even inadvertently step on some people who get in your way, as the ideal you quest for can blind you to the effect of your actions on others. However, Mindi, you don't hesitate to recognize and reward those people who have helped you on your way up, because you are an honest and fair player.

       What kind of kiss are you?     You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming. Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.

      Back from vaction.. it was well earned and very needed. Now back to reality and everything that goes with it!!! Work totally sucks and I dread the thought of being there. There is no human factor there any more. We are all $ signs and treated like it. Beat it till it bleeds and dies is how the employees there are treated.. used and abused... Oh but hang in there they say.. next year will be rewarding and you might even get a raise!! KISS MY ASS I SAY!! Letting go people who have given everything to the company and to their co-workers. You have no safety line here. Keep the bastards and the whiners.. let all the true bright stars go... makes no sense to me. Not my problem my netter half says.. don't worry about it!! How can I not??? I care about what I do and how it's done....working in chaos kills me!!! I'd give anything to not go back...BUT I have to... I guess I'll put on the fake smile and do my best... Fun Fun!

        -Hurt- I hope you know this is my FAVORITE nine inch nails song. Many people have left your life.. and it seems that every time you are hurt even more. Sometimes you consider killing everyone that's ever hurt you, but deep down you know that you care too much to do that. You are always there waiting for them to come back into your life, and would give them everything you have if they did.. but you know you're just going to disappoint them.    urlLink   What Nine Inch Nails song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        You are Form 2,  Angel : The Pure.   "And The Angel rose as holy protector for all that was created.  She fought with honor and valor to serve the good of the world.  But the coming of the mankind was her downfall; and end to purity."   Some examples of the Angel Form are Michael (Christian) and Hercules (Greek). The Angel is associated with the concept of virtue, the number 2, and the element of wind. Her sign is the zenith sun.  As a member of Form 2, you are a person of your word.  You generally keep your promises and give everything you do your best.  Although some people see you as overbearing sometimes, you know that you have to stay true to yourself and do what's right.  Angels are the best friends to have because they are brutally honest.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

The money is nice but it's Min a mean little B.... believe me!! Everyone around me is sick... keep your germs to yourself... I need to go into hiding! I'm so tired every creative bone in my body has turned to mush. I do want to start painting.. That's my new craving. My daughter Callie is really blossoming in her drawing.. so impressive. Sister Hobie is throwing like a mad women, hopefullt she throws me a cool bowl for my table.So Halloween is next week!! WOOHOO!! My favorite holiday. Looks as if I'm old and broke so no fun for me this year. I shall live through my kids. I dressed Callie like I would.. what a lovely Vamp she is. Kayla a nun , cause she's so bad and Mikal the daywalker. Almighty Blade! It's so cool . I will post pictures on my website. I promise to have some morbid and dark poetry next entry. Until then , may the dark wings of rapture wrap you in their embrace. Moonlight and magic.

      Well ... what a beautiful weekend and start of the week. Indian summer? A little late but welcome anyway. So .. I haven't written in so long and have no desire to write poetry, I crave to paint.. Watercolor.. skies a blaze and nights of mystery.  to bleed the paint on paper will gratify the need I have.  I want to listen to Shane playing his guitar in the backround and feel a cool breeze run across my shoulders. I'll let my brush caress the paper into a frenzy of color and motion. I feel the need deep inside my soul..

There is a position at my current job that I might look into. MAYBE. This week has been a bad mommy week. My Kayla is struggling in school and try as she might she is still not getting it. I have been working very closely with her and the school... THEN she goes and gets herself 3 days in school suspension.. for a note she wrote that was VERY inaproperate( spl?) Anyway.... after taking 1/2 a day off to take all 3 to the dentist ( 2 out of 3  with NO cavities ) Mikal gets to make a trip the Orthodontist..yippy. Then it's off to the school for a meeting about Kayla's learning problems.... oh after that I was done.. just beat ! Now ...back to work for an hour till a meeting that took most of the afternoon..... how can you motivate yourself after a day like this? Not to mention I got My Friend and now feel like truck that ran over me is now backing up .....****sigh****   Callie my oldest is now involved in after school clubs and I can't see her during the week due to practice, ***sniff and lip quivers *** I am SO attached to my kids. Like I said it was a bad mommy week. Tonight was good..we had fun. I have wonderful childern.

      A new Poem Short  Sweet   SURRENDER Snuggled next to you the warmth of your body against mine feeling your hand as it travels down my back soft kisses on my neck a sigh slips through my lips I rollover to face you my breasts pressed against your chest I look into your eyes and smile I am yours , take me.
