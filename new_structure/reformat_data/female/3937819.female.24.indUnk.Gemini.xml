       Bridget was a sweetheart,  With Greek letters around her neck on a chain.  She wasnât really my type, she was beautiful  And I'm kinda vain.  Her mind was closed like a liquor store on Sunday...  She was tryinâ to make her ex-boyfriend mad,  Itâs kind of a rebound, but thatâs okay...  Sheâs married with a kid on the way  And I'm glad I didnât stand in the way  Of a good thing.    Shelby was a stripper,  a damn good mechanic and a friend...  She used to pick me up in her â64 and take me places,Iâd never been.  She drank vodka on the rocks with a tall glass,  Chased with cocaine and her teenaged girlfriends.  I couldnât phase her but thatâs okay,  Sheâs livinâ with a girl named Renee.  Last I heard she was teachin in Frisco...  Sheâs got a good thing.    Alice was a bartender,  at a place that I used to play for awhile.  Some of the girls didnât like her...  sheâd get twenty dollar tips with a smile.  I used to talk to her to try to get in her head,  But weâd just end up drunk in my bed....  I never knew her, thatâs okay,  Sheâs in Vegas makinâ five bills a day.  She said I wasnât too much fun when I was sober,  And now sheâs got a good thing.    So hereâs to the lady......  whose name it hurts me to say,  She's the proverbial one...  that got away.  She said life is all a young girl has...  And I canât find mine whilelivinâ yours...  I donât blame her, but thatâs okay  Sheâs married with a kid, and a kid on the way...  And I'm glad I didnât get in the way....  Of a good thing.      This has to be one of my favoritist songs...is favoritist a word?! Anyway, it was written by Matt Powell, but Bleu Edmondson does a cover of it. I think this was one of the first songs that I heard Bleu sing, that I fell in love with. I think to appreciate it you have to hear it, but even just reading it we can all somehow relate...there are always those one's you look back on and think...hmmm??!?!

       Ok kids, here's the deal...I, Sha-Kyla, work in  HELL !! I hate this place!! It is completely re-damn-diculous that I have to indeed work w/ the devil herself!! I swear I will have a nervous breakdown before I turn 25. Between work, and school, and WORK, I think I might just do it!! I have my appt. w/ my advisor on the 19th...he will let me know what my schedule will look like for this last year of school. If indeed I have to take the 18 hrs like I'm thinking...I will kill myself!! Ok so not really but pretty close, I will probably just have a heart attack and die. I have to work my 40 hr. 8-5 job to be able to afford the bills I have now, so that means I might have to move back in w/ the ol' rent-a-rooskie's!! WOW, that should definately be scary. That is if they still have room for me...after I left the first time they seemed to have shit moved into my room like the day after...sweet huh??? Anyway, well I'm pretty much not being very productive right now...got some im windows open...y'all are crackin me up!! Ok so Amy just sent me a pic of Manny she took last night @ Stubb's....WOW, HOLY BALLZ (as stu would say), he is such a cutie-patootie! I love it!! The Lost Trailers are such Rock Stars...I wanna belike them when I grow up!!!! Ok, well I'm gonna go get something to drink...and if I think of anything else then I'll let y'all know!!
