           Como matar a un leÃ³n                 Estaba una tarde entre las flores de la Patagonia cuando vi un leÃ³n aterrador. Saque mi rifle y le metÃ­ un pedazo de plomo por la cabeza. Como el leÃ³n seguÃ­a vivo saque mi navaja-espada y se la meti por el _ _ _ _.     DespuÃ©s de la tragedia me quede con mucho hambre. Entonces, me alimente de la sustancia gelatinosa que venia de donde le habÃ­a puesto el cuchillo al leÃ³n.                               I was playing around with my cousin when he decided he wanted to write a story. So I got really excited and told him he could say it and I would type it and then Iâd include it in my new website, Giggles ( urlLink www.8thgradegiggles.blogspot.com ). Well, being his silly self, he made a short one up that didnât make much sense. But as I love him to death, include it in my website I will.                          Just for you to know a little bit about my cousin, his name is Joaquin and he lives in south Argentina. Heâs about eleven right now and is a really cool kid. He couldnât be any cuter and heâs everything youâd want for a cousin.                        So here it is Joaquin. Iâm posting your story in your honor!                                                          How To Kill a Lion                                One afternoon, I was in between flowers from the Patagonia, when I saw a frightening lion. I took out my rifle and stuck a bullet upside his head. Because the lion was still alive, I took out my navajo-sword and I stuck it in his ___.                      After experiencing this tragedy, I realized I was starving. So, I fed myself with the jelly substance which came from where Iâd stuck the knife on the lion.

        Finally, my own website... itÂ´s better than anyone rumors it 2 be!     Here I will put whatever I want, and no1 will be able 2 tell me thatÂ´s rude, or wrong.      No1 will know hu I am... theyÂ´ll all read it and GIGGLE or, unfortunately, the victims, will weep.      As I prepare 2 put more and more information on this website, I think 2 myself... what Giggle information do I know at this moment, in the middle of summer?     NOTHING!!     So, IÂ´ve created this post-- any1 can comment on it &amp;amp; provide Giggle information. It may appear at any moment-- 2 my discretion.     Remember, never put 2 much information a-b urself or else the victims will stalk u like a hound!     Good Luck!          --the 1 person Giggle staff
