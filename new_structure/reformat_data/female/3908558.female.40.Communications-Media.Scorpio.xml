           Eleanor of Aquitaine:âHow, from where we started, did we ever get to this?â  Henry II: âStep by step.â --The Lion in Winter  Buying new clothes can be so much fun because they give you a chance to see yourself in a new way. But sometimes shopping is not such a happy occasion. Like the other day, I had to buy myself a bunch of new pants because I havenât lost the weight I gained a couple of months ago, and I canât keep showing up for work in clothes that donât fit.  I bought all black, of course, but since it was an emergency I had to take whatever black pants I could get. Thatâs how I wound up with black linen trousers embroidered with a summer-themed pattern: sun glasses, bathing suits, beach chairs. I call them my clown pants. I wore them yesterday, and all I needed was a big red ball to put on my nose.   I pray that this is the last time I have to buy emergency pants.

          Is going to Dunkinâ Donuts for coffee like reading  Playboy  for the articles? Well, whether it is or not, thatâs what I did the other dayâand may I add, I asked for skim milk, not regular, in my decaf.    On my way out, two surprising things happened: 1) I spotted a handsome man through the glass door, on his way in. A truly handsome man is an unusual find (letâs face it, thereâs a reason women are called the fairer sex), yet there he was. 2) Then he held the door open for me!    It wasnât his good manners that shocked me, but that he even  saw  me. Because fat women are virtually invisible to men.    I know, several times over, what itâs like to respond to an online personal ad with a photo, then never hear from the guy again. So for a handsome man, especially, not only to notice me but to be considerate tooâ¦! What is he, a circus act? Does he also catch bullets between his teeth?    Maybe, amid the sideshow fairway, he struck up a relationship with the Fat Lady that really left an impression. Maybe he has super-human vision that lets him see the invisible. Or maybe size just doesnât matter to him. All I know is, Iâm still scratching my head.

           Iâm getting the fear.   Fear of failure. Fear of a lifetime of fat. Fear of further disappointing myself. Fear of never living up to my potential.    Iâm losing resolve. Iâm caving in. Iâm feeling old. Iâm looking fat.    And what exactly replaces food, when that is practically the only thing to look forward to? Salad, steamed vegetables, grilled chickenâtheyâre a penance. The reparation for years of bad choices leaves me gagging.    I canât live like that and I canât live like this. I canât accept the way I am and I canât change the way I am.    Just another day in the life of an addict.

      If chocolate were crack, Iâd be a $2 whore. So you can understand why I identify closely with drug addicts and alcoholics. (Workaholics? Not so much.)  I got a call recently regarding my blood test results. The general practitionerâs office manager began with: âThe doctor wants you to make an appointment with the nutritionist.â  Why? She quoted my ridiculously high cholesterol, âbadâ cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  âDr. O wrote âHorrible!â in your chart,â said the office manager.  I donât need to see a nutritionist. I know what Iâm doing wrong. I know Iâm killing myself with food.  My mother literally dropped dead of a massive coronary when she was 63. Her mother died of a stroke at 60, followed two years later by her fatherâalso of a stroke.   Everybodyâs heard a story like my former neighborâs, who continued to smoke even as she was suffocating with emphysema. I identify with such people. I always knew when the time came for me, I wouldnât be able to help myself either, despite my family health history.  âWhy donât you just stop eating?â an acquaintance once asked me. Heyâthanks for the fresh insight! I never wouldâve thought of that! Obviously, if it were that simple for me, I wouldâve done it a long time ago.  My acquaintance wouldnât understand the Apostle Paul when he wrote in the Book of Romans,    âI do not understand what I doâ¦. I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to doâthis I keep on doing.â  I used to think that in Heaven Iâd eat as much chocolate as I wanted without impunity. But not to have chocolate at all, and never even miss itâ that  would be Heaven.     What I et today: Lightly sweetened iced tea, a croissant, 2 cups of fruit, half a mozzarella sandwich with pesto, and a baked potato with genuine old-timey butter.

      Last night I did a half-hour exercise tape. While thatâs not much time, itâs a comfort to know that I actually burn more calories than a thin person doing the same workout because itâs extra work to tote all that lard around.  I used to love exercise. I got into it about 10 years and 60 pounds ago. I didnât get thin, but my fat-to-muscle ratio changed significantly. I had a lot of endurance and strength, and actually got to the point where my body felt good even when I wasnât exercising. (I never wouldâve believed it if I hadnât experienced it first-hand.)  Now Iâm starting at square one and overcoming inertia is the primary challenge. Sometimes just watching an exercise program can intimidate me: I think Iâll never regain the level of fitness I had before because Iâm so big and old, so I end up doing nothing.  My range of motion is incredibly limited nowâwas it so 11 years ago? Well, 11 years ago I didnât have a bum back. I can barely bend to mid-shin now. 	 It makes me sad to remember when I could lie on the floor and bring my legs straight over my torso and touch my toes to the floor over my head. Maybe I had more elastin in my system at the time because I was an adolescent. I sure ainât no adolescent now.    What I et today: Fruit, an oatmeal square and coffee with skim milk for breakfast; Salisbury steak, a scoop of mashed potatoes and peas with gravy and baked Lays for lunch; two handsful of mini pretzels, 2 oz of graham crakers and a cup of coffee w/whole milk.

      God help me. My 20W pants barely fit any more. Six years ago, I was down to a 14 and, even though that is now classified as a plus-size in some venues, I felt very good about myself. At my thinnest (i.e., 20 years ago) I was an 8âroughly Catherine Zeta Jonesâ size nowâand couldnât believe it. Even then, I knew it wouldnât last.   But I never thought Iâd get this big. When I saw myself in a new suit last week, I expected to look OK since it was a dark monochrome. But I looked like a double-wide trailer. Yes, I am critical of myself, but even in my mindâs eye, I donât picture myself  that  big. The reality is actually worse than my perception. Now  that  is a nightmare.  I think about food, weight loss and fitness about 80 percent of the time. That means only 20 percent of my waking hours is devoted to everything else: God, family, friends, pets, culture, politics, ecology, the presidential election, movies, TV, books, music etc. Plus there are overlaps such as, âWhy am I not as thin as actress I see on TV right now?â and âGod, will you help me lose weight/exercise?â So, really, I think about food etc. more than 80 percent of the time.  OK, hereâs a theoretically achievable but somewhat ambitious goal: To weigh less than 200 in six months. Is that too much to ask?     What I et today: 2 muffins, a serving of soft pretzel sticks with butter, a medium strawberry/pineapple smoothie, a few mini pretzels, most of a Taco Bell double-decker taco and an apple empenada.
