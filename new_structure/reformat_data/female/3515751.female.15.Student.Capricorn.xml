      Itâs like only once a week I write hereâ¦so many things can just happenâ¦*phew*â¦so I think I should start. Till now, God never really revealed Himself to me but I learned something else. It should be in the later part of this blog. This morning, I woke up and I actually dreaded to go to school although I wasnât sleepy and I was kinda awake but in any ways, I still go to school. I was kinda worried in school coz something is going to get wrong somehowâ¦on Wednesday night, I told âherâ that I want to talk to her and we set appointment. Then I started to dream that very night I asked her. I dreamt that we were enemies and we didnât talk to each other at all. We hated each other a lot. And when I awoke, I was like I hope that wonât happen or not Iâm going to be dead. Then, today I went and talk to her lar.at fist I dunno where she disappear. Sheâs just no where. Not sure. The after that I felt so thirsty and thought that I should go get water and then I band into Grace and she say Serena wants to see me. So went and find for Serena forgetting bout my hungry stomach and my thirsty mouth. And then when I met her she was like: are you free now? And I said I donât think so. She was like: Oh then never mind. Just want to ask whether you want to do the newsletter. You want?....okayâ¦at that moment arâ¦I also dunno what to say coz I really want to do but I scared I canât handle so many things. But ended up I say okaylar coz I donât think it will be hard larâ¦some how I will find the time wan. Oh yarâ¦then in the morning right, Su Yi told me Iâm in the worship team. At that moment I was like wanna scream alreadyâ¦I was really happy and excited larâ¦I was really desperate larâ¦itâs three years already I applied to be a vocalistâ¦so I was overjoyed lar. Okay. I think I should continue. So I finish talking to Serena and then âsheâ appeared. I was likeâ¦there you are. I walked her to block G to put her bag first. But on the way, she asked me what I wanted to tell her. I told her that sheâs know later. Then she start guessing lar and then she say âis it about me?ââ¦then I was like âermâ¦something like that larââ¦I think thatâs what I sayâ¦itâs somewhere there lar. and then she so suddenly say âthen I donât want to talk about itâ. I was so so hurt at that moment. I didnât know what to do. I just got kinda stunt at that moment but Iâm still walking and talking larâ¦I was kinda disappointed coz I put aside all my cowardliness and took up all my guts to talk to her. I have a problem in talking to people face to face especially when itâs some kind of problem. I was very disappointed and I didnât know what to do. I tried to make as if nothing is wrong and itâs okayâ¦I went up the stairs towards the canteen lar. When I was about to go up the stairs, âsheâ called me lar but I turn behind and she didnât look as if she just called me. But then she so suddenly she appear next to me lar. And then she ate her fries while talking to me lar. we went into one of the classes in block Eâ¦and we started talking. It wasnât what I expected larâ¦I couldnât really talk to her. My heart was beating so fastâ¦and one scary thingâ¦she say âlook at me!ââ¦I was likeâ¦arrrrrrâ¦.she look so scary. Very scary indeed. Staring at someone is not nice. Then we started the conversation. I have to keep quiet for like a few minutes coz my heart feels like coming out and I feel like leaving the place. While talking to her, it seems like I dunno what to say. My words are all gone. My heart wasnât there. It pumped out of me already. Itâs so hard for me to get all the words out. Then I told her bout everythingâ¦not exactly everything coz I totally forget what I want to tell her and what I want to ask her. Just staring at her makes me want to run away already. And then after that she asked me a few thingsâ¦actually a lot of thingsâ¦.and she told me a lot of things also. âI realized that Iâm not the first one you have this problem with. And I donât think Iâm wrong and thereâs nothing wrong with me. I treat everyone the same. You just have to know. You should sit down and ask yourself what you want and how you really feel. You know, I donât feel hurt or angry. But I feel sad for you.â I was kinda quiet. Thinking about what she was saying. And I told her that I know itâs because of me but then I really canât understand myself and I dunno how to look within myself. I really donât know and I think thatâs why I canât really get along with people. And she actually went through a lot. She went through all this before. And then I start to try to change topic. I donât want to continue like that coz we kept quiet for some time. I was thinking a lot and she just stare at me. So I told her about everything in my heart. My family, my friends and my walk with God and most of the things I am going through, she went through before. She told me a lot of things which really encourages me. And God really spoke through her to me. Faith is not feeling or something you can see but something you believe although you canât see or feel it. And I should be very grateful coz Iâve known God at this age. I thought of everything she said. No family is perfect. Everything weâre gong through helps to build up my faith. I donât know howâs it going to help me yet but Iâll wait and see.  And today, manda came for CF. I miss her a lotâ¦she seems taller I think. And then the speaker, pastor melcamâ¦I thinkâ¦canât remember his name and dunno how to spell. Anyways, he really spoke to me especially near the endâ¦keeping the fire burning and how to get caught in the fire. And that I should stand firm, do my quiet time and trust in Him. Maybe slowly Iâll see the difference. Everyone is experiencing different things and yarlor.  In any ways, Iâm seriously very happy now coz I can singâ¦.heeheâ¦and I got a chance to serve Godâ¦I got to do the newsletter...iâm actually very desperate although I might have to make my whole schedule even more packâ¦but I really want to serve Godâ¦Heâs so big and even as I face a giant Iâll still look at the giant like itâs so small coz I have an even BIGGER GOD!!!! AMEN!â¦ohyarâ¦I hope I will remember to bring an empty cd for Serena on Monday. Have to get rid of the forgetful me. okaylarâ¦I think this should be all for nowâ¦hope to blog again soonâ¦my exams are so near already. Iâve like exactly 100 more days to study only. Hopefully by Godâs grace, I can get really results. My parents are kinda pressuring me now. Okaylarâ¦got to goâ¦bye!! Love, Jovy.

      Dear diary, I donât know what to do nowâ¦my leg so pain and I had to limpâ¦anywaysâ¦thatâs not the reason I blog hereâ¦thereâs like 6 more daysâ¦last Saturdayâ¦I was suppose to go for prayer in church but I couldnât go so I pray at home larâ¦and during prayer, there are so many things I didnât expect alrâ¦itâs been some time since I really spend time with God telling Him everything and how I feel and things like that larâ¦and when I spoke to Himâ¦the starting was like normal larâ¦all the prayer items and things like thatâ¦and then only I start really talking to Himâ¦I was under my blanketâ¦hot in thereâ¦and through the prayerâ¦I was really tired and I was really lostâ¦I didnât know where was God anymoreâ¦I donât know whether is He still real to meâ¦I even doubt a lotâ¦whether is there really a God out thereâ¦I didnât knowâ¦and I really seek Him and I really prayed really hardâ¦I want Him to be real to meâ¦Iâve gone through most of the time this year without Himâ¦.even though Iâve been encouraging people to hold on to Him but I donât know about myselfâ¦I cried and criedâ¦I plead to Himâ¦I really want to know the answersâ¦all the questions which stayed unansweredâ¦I really donât knowâ¦and that very moment, I challenge Godâ¦and I think itâs not a very good challenge larâ¦I was like: God, if you still love me, if you still want me, if youâre still there for me, please...please God let me seeâ¦let me knowâ¦and let me feel You againâ¦and God, You see me throughâ¦and You know me bestâ¦God, if you are the true Godâ¦the Almighty Godâ¦if You are realâ¦open my eyesâ¦and my heartsâ¦let me feel Your touch and Your love againâ¦I know that this might not be the right time yetâ¦but thereâs 8 daysâ¦by Sunday, I hope there would be a differenceâ¦and I really hope that you heard my prayersâ¦Lord, pick me up again. That was part of my prayer to Godâ¦I really donât know but it was exactly how I felt at that momentâ¦last year, something like that happen also and I really had a hard time through itâ¦I had a few people help me up and I found my way again. But this year, I really donât want to disturb anyoneâ¦and if God really is real, He will bring me home. Thatâs all I know. this year, Iâm having PMR and many are having SPMâ¦I really donât want to disturb any of themâ¦I know that somehowâ¦somehowâ¦everything would be fineâ¦I hopeâ¦Iâve been really worriedâ¦I really donât knowâ¦and I dunno what to do nowâ¦just sit down and waitâ¦Iâve seek for Him for 15 years alreadyâ¦and I really have no strength anymoreâ¦coz I know that no matter how I seek for Him but if He doesnât draw me backâ¦thereâs no use and Iâm starting to give upâ¦I dunnoâ¦I really donât knowâ¦Love, Dunnoâ¦

actually go to CF in peaceâ¦like I say, I never ask my mum larâ¦and through the whole morningâ¦school larâ¦Iâve been thinking a lotâ¦and I really can sense that something is not rightâ¦.and that something is going to go wrong somehowâ¦I felt so confused and worriedâ¦I felt so scared of whatâs going to happen and will I be a ble to go for CFâ¦will my mum just pop up in CF and say Iâve to go homeâ¦I really donât knowâ¦I was very scaredâ¦.and ended upâ¦when school endedâ¦I went to the toilet and then I went to put my bag and then went straight to call my mumâ¦while I was waiting in the line, I was like thinking and guessing a lotâ¦if my mum say I have to go home then howâ¦and if she scold me howâ¦but in the other handâ¦if she say okay then at least I think I wonât feel so bad kuaâ¦I really didnât knowâ¦I was very scaredâ¦my heart was beating so fastâ¦and when I dialed the number, she picked up the phone and I told her that Iâm going CF and that Melissa is fetching me homeâ¦actually I wrote it on the white board in my kitchen already wan but jus tin case she donât allow larâ¦and guess what she sayâ¦.she say okayâ¦I was like âokaylarâ¦bye!!ââ¦I was so happy larâ¦coz I got to stay for CF and I really feel a lot betterâ¦.i felt no worriesâ¦thereâs such great joy and peace in my heartâ¦and also todayâ¦.i never really talk much to the form 5s coz I dunno whyâ¦seems to slowly drift away already larâ¦I canât really talk to them anymoreâ¦not much alreadyâ¦I donât really know why lar but yarlorâ¦I was with Joyce and Evelynâ¦and we talk a lotâ¦yarlorâ¦for a change lorâ¦mix with others moreâ¦Melissa ushering mar and Tze Yuen she go toiletâ¦and never returnâ¦so yarlorâ¦.at least I enjoy talking to Joyce and Evelynâ¦itâs nice chatting with themâ¦at least it doesnât remind me of any problems larâ¦.today Iâm kinda weird also larâ¦when I meet Joyce and Evelyn in the canteen, I saw Stefenie and Pei Wern and a lot more people larâ¦but I never say hi to them as if I never see themâ¦.but I never really look at them anywayâ¦just make as if yarlorâ¦but today was a kinda perfect Fridayâ¦ in school today arâ¦.letâs seeâ¦bmâ¦class teacher plan the school carnival thing and weâre doing haunted houseâ¦and Iâm the flier-girlâ¦with Suk Teng and Pei Jieâ¦but

can ask my sis to help me get from him and yarlarâ¦since the ghost thingâ¦we started talking bout ghost a lotâ¦ehehâ¦and we were wondering if a small kid would go in and then got shock by the ghost and started cryingâ¦then how arâ¦the ghost comfort the kidâ¦wowâ¦ghost can comfort kidsâ¦thatâs coolâ¦.how niceâ¦friendly ghostâ¦dunnolarâ¦weâll seeeeeeâ¦.and then during moralâ¦Cik Magdalene is our teacher lar and she ask us to go into groups and act out a drama using any of the nilai moralsâ¦and my group âkasih sayangââ¦and we came out with a story where a we get back results and then one of us did really badlyâ¦and couldnât accept the fact larâ¦and wanted to dieâ¦jump down the building but then the other tow and the teacher stopped herâ¦and so on larâ¦but hten ended up we didnât do the dramam coz not enough timeâ¦wait larâ¦next lessonâ¦ and this Sundayâ¦.teach small kidsâ¦scaryâ¦hopefully they will listen somehowâ¦and hopefully I donât lost my temperâ¦I wonât larâ¦I thinkâ¦.hehehâ¦not so fast wanâ¦but then the materials all also I havenât get yetâ¦I have to get it laterâ¦I just rememberâ¦dielorâ¦so many thingsâ¦nevermindlarâ¦Iâll make it wanâ¦besides thatâ¦I canât really remember what alreadyâ¦ohyarâ¦today during science in science lab, I and Melissa played a game call âlook and donât laughââ¦through the whole game, so many interruptionsâ¦and we started so many times until the last time where we just stare and stare larâ¦neither one of us laugh and just stare and stareâ¦but for me, I just stare lar and I was thinking of a lot of thingsâ¦whenever I just stare at something too long already, Iâll start to think a lotâ¦and thatâs what happen larâ¦I just think larâ¦and the first thing I thought of is the time when my great grandmother pass awayâ¦when I was standard 5â¦.although I wasnât close to her and I only see her like less then 10 times a yearâ¦but sheâs very niceâ¦when she passed away, I was really sad and I criedâ¦she wasnât a Christianâ¦and I was very disappointedâ¦I just cried throughâ¦and as I stare at Melissa, my mind is drifting towards that very moment and Melissa changed into my great grandmotherâ¦and then after that, my mind flash to another sceneâ¦and Melissa turn into Stefenie nowâ¦and the sleepover night start to come back againâ¦the time when Stefenie was just staring at usâ¦and I didnât dare to talkâ¦I was just looking at herâ¦my heart was beating so fastâ¦I was about to cry and then I told her that I was the one who secret-mailed her and she said she knows and sheâs proud of meâ¦for telling her larâ¦and she gave me a hugâ¦a big hugâ¦.but in my heartâ¦I really donât knowâ¦there are so many thingsâ¦I felt so scaredâ¦I feel Iâm lostâ¦and I feel really badâ¦there are a lot of things in my heart that I never told herâ¦and I dunno how to tell herâ¦I didnât dare toâ¦all I did was smile and pretend like nothingâ¦I was worried larâ¦and at that very moment Melissa look at me larâ¦the whole scene just pop offâ¦and Melissa ask me whether am I okay or notâ¦and I was kinda blur lar but I say I was okay and one thing is thatâ¦she say I was cryingâ¦I didnât realize larâ¦but dunnolarâ¦scary larâ¦just pausing for a moment can make me think so muchâ¦and in between all those thoughts there is also another thing larâ¦then after that, I just start thinking of why Iâm still thinking of that larâ¦my great grandmother is not a Christian and that moment had really make me want to save each and everyone of my close onesâ¦so many people is dieing and I really want lives to be savedâ¦I donât want to see people die some moreâ¦Iâm scaredâ¦I dunnoâ¦that incident of my great grandmotherâs death had motivate me to bring people to Christâ¦and Iâm still kidna working on that larâ¦and bout Stefenie, I think itâs coz not everything is solve yet and nothing is done yetâ¦and Iâm worried larâ¦so yarlorâ¦for now, I just donât want to think of itâ¦headache onlyâ¦okayâ¦today CF was soooooo SUPERB!!! they have testimonials and I just found out that Keshia only came to know God when she was form 1 and accepted Christ verbally when she was in form 2â¦thatâs a surprise. and becoming a committee for camp is really toughâ¦wowâ¦I wonder manâ¦and I bought camp t-shirtâ¦itâs so niceâ¦I got the camp book tooâ¦I love it so muchâ¦I think I will hug it to sleep tonightâ¦today ended up really fun and it started really fun tooâ¦but then in the morning I got tummy ache larâ¦ate something wrong kuaâ¦but it went off after a while and came back again and I donât care

      heyo!! it's been a very tiring day...the whole day out...went to church and then go shopping then go to my uncle's house. let's start with church...today in church, we talk about love and seriously i'm still thinking of something...dunnolar...then during second session, we had committee meeting...it was kinda fun but the president(James) and Teck Meng never come...so sorta quiet and they will miss a lot fo things...besides that, we did feedback on the 'Lost and Found' night...there are a lot of changes we had to make and for me, i think i have to be more aware and build my communication skills...and also do my very very very best to put God first in everything i do, say and think...i want to make a difference in my youth and i want to see the fire burning brightly in everyone's life...this year, i really really want to make a difference in my home, school and youth...i've been kinda praying bout it...and God is seriously working...He's been opening doors for me but sometimes i dunno how to use the doors...i enter half way and then i dunno where to turn...and i think i'm really starting to learn as i meet more nad more people...God is seriously teaching and guiding me through...i've really want to make a difference in my home...my family...not just my small family but my big big family tree...my cousins...today, i visited my uncle. i never really talk to my uncle coz they speak chinese...i went and talk to my cousins...who are bout 26 and 27 i think...somewhere there...i was chit chatting when all of a sudden they started talking bout Christianity and religions...they ask a lot of questions...there are even questions i dunno how to answer....kinda tuff...proofs that i don't really know much yet and i need to move on...but after talking to them, i'm not sure whether i planted a seed or watered a seed....i'm not sure but i really can't do much...sometimes, i think they know more than i do although they are not Christians...in the car, i thought of it for a very long time...how should i answer the questions...if next time i face this kind of questions again, how should i reply...i really dn't know and i really want to know...i wish i can have a bible class where i can just go to when i really need answers...i know i don't know a lot still but i dunno how to know more. i don't know how...i need help and that one is really really need help...God is seriously helping me and answering my prayers...but i'm not ready and i didn't know...i kept on asking God to open doors for me but i'm not ready...not that i'm too young...just that i haven't get ready the answers...i haven't know bout my own belief deeply yet...and for now,i guess i should stay put to studying bout the Bible and and bout Christianity...i really got to know more...a lot more... i also got stuck with one song...not exactly a song but it's a game lar...it goes like...Malaysia sofamiredola lai ya lai ya tat tat tat...laiya laiya tat tat tat...1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...hehe...young kids play but i like it too...just learnt it...today's worship was good also although there wasn't drum...kinda quiet lar...without drum...not enough noise from the drums...but it was good...we can worship God even if there isn't music coz music is not all that matters...Jesus Rox!! Amen!! love, Jovy.
