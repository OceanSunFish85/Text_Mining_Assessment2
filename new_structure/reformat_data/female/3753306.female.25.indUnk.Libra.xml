        First of all, I have to apologize for my poor English writing, but it was something that I would love to share with all the Red Sox fans. I know people would probably tell me: "itâs your own fault going to Yankee Stadium all by yourself with Red Sox T-shirt", but when does going to a baseball game become a dangerous thing?    It was almost a month ago, but for me, it was like yesterday.   On June 30 th , I, a 25 years old girl Red Sox fan who doesnât speak too much English (imported from Asia), was molested in Yankees Stadium.   Itâs hard for me to describe how much I like baseball, but I certainly love it much enough that I would take a trip down to New York and support my team. But, I also try to give respect for the home team (Yankees) since Iâd like to receive some respect from their fans as well.  When the game started, I was really focused watching every single pitch, and even though I was surrounded by a huge number of Yankees fans, they found me interesting because I was probably the only Red Sox fan in the whole section, I was there ALONE, and, I am a SHE. The guy next to me tried to make a conversation, I donât know if it because he found me cute, or simply because he had never seen any girl doing score sheet during the game. But we discussed some major league baseball rules and how itâs different with the ones in Asia. He was nice and said: "too bad that you are a Sox Fan!" "Well, but we all love baseball!" I laughed. (His girlfriend was sitting right next to him, and eyeballed me for a while.)   I donât remember when, but people started yelling, "Boston Suck!", "1918!", "Masssssholeeee!" next to my ear. The kid sitting near by made a funny face at me, I smiled back, and pretend I donât understand English.   During the game, people sometimes poked at me, because I had my Pokey Reese T-shirt on. "Your guy just missed it!", "Your guy is no better than Jeter!"â¦. "Well, at least he tried to catch it. Itâs a good try though!", I replied. Still, I smiled at the old folks sitting behind me even though they did enjoy poking at my Pokey T-shirt so much. I was prepared to receive all those nasty yelling, and I had no problem taking some poking.   There were 4 guys wearing pinstripe jersey (letâs call them "pinstripe 4-some") sitting right in front of me. It was PAINFUL sitting around them. They made fun of me probably every 10 seconds and tried to convince me to root for the Yankees simply because I am Asian and theyâve got Matsui and how Boston is a racist city. "I like Matsui, but I just like Red Sox much more." I tried to calm down and reply something nice and reasonable. I put my focus back to the game, and thatâs what Iâm paying my tickets for.   After the 7 th  inning, people started to get crazy â and "pinstripe 4-some" were just started to lose their sanity and targeting at me. Any nasty yelling could happen to a Red Sox fan, I received them all. Still, I know itâs would just be dumb if I yell at them back, so I simply replied: "Whateverâ¦ I donât really speak English just like Hideki Matsuiâ¦". I guess they got really mad after hearing that.   Whenever any of the Red Sox players got strikeout, they turned back, looked at me, grabbed my score sheet and force me to write down a "K" in my score sheet. "Do you know how to write K?" They laughed, and kept saying "Go HOME! Asia or Boston, EITHER ONE! We donât want you massholes here!"   I was a bit sad, not really because all the mistreated, simply because our bullpen sort of blew up the game. But still, I wanted to see the game, I would love to support them up till the last minute. And I thought the situation was not too bad â other than the "poking", no physical contact were made.   When the Quan-Go-Mo (a stupid abbreviation of Quantrill, Gordon and Mariano made by Michael Kay @YESNetwork) showed up, the crowd went wild. Whenever the Yankees fans cheering for their team, the pinstripe 4-some turned back, pulled me off my chair and grabbed my hand, forcing me to give them a "high five".    I started to get upset and told them not to touch me.    Apparently, they became the one who donât speak English, and they even tried to pull me over to their seat. One of the guys was grabbing my arm and another guy had both his hands on my face squeezing my cheeks.   That hurt, and my rosy cheeks almost turned purple and slightly bruised.  I was shocked. I tried so hard to push them away and it did not really work. Finally, I started yelling, "Donât touch me! Get your hands off me!!".   However, nobody could really hear me at that time. The stadium was loud with all the cheering sound, and everyone was standing up at that time. The people around me did not try to stop them (pinstripe 4-some were pretty big), the security were too far away and did not sense itâ¦.   I would like to believe that the people did not see what happened, rather than "whatever, sheâs a Red Sox fanâ¦"   I was the "Yankees Stadium Private Entertainment Girl" for a while till I finally found my way out. I felt bad for the kids sitting around me because they witnessed the whole molestation. The kid looked at me with sympathyâ¦   I knew the "pinstripe 4-some" would not easily just let me go, and I needed to get out of my seat as soon as possible. Itâs not easy since I was so stuck in my seat (right in the middle) and I waited till someone behind me made a space for me to pass.   I was dumb â because I ran into the restroom to wipe up the running nose and tearing eyes before running to the security. Later, the security told me they could not catch them, and asked me why I did not tell them immediately when it happened.   I was too tired and exhausted to do anything else other than crying, and couldnât even say a decent sentence in English.   It was not a pleasant experience, and itâs even more difficult for me to write about it. But still, I know I have to do it because the games are coming again this weekend, and what happened to me last month might happen again to any female â if they are Yankees fans.   My friends, itâs just a baseball game, and we all go to the park because we all like baseball â no matter which team you root for. It does take a lot of courage going to Fenway Park if you are an Yankee Fan, and vice versa.   I just hope, whatever happened to me would never happen again in any baseball park. And please, if you see some helpless Yankees fans in Fenway, do not hesitate to help them out â I really wished I had some help from the Yankee fans at that time.     Despite all these, I would still go back to Yankees Stadium this September and support my favorite team.

      Today, I had  urlLink PULP  in my CD Player running for the whole day.    I used to starve myself not having lunch during my teen years, and I could save up my lunch money to get CDs. More than 400 CDs lying somewhere in my tiny room in Taipei, and my dad had to make a mini-database organizing them. Some of those CDs are really crappy music, after it felled off the bullitinboard. However, some CDs you would just keep listening to it even years later.     urlLink Different Class  is definitely one of them.  I got that CD almost 10 years ago, and now, it still sound fresh to me, and stroked me even more. Good music with deep thought should always be cherished, and it a good thing that PULP never comprised (like Oasis and Blur) and still kept moving.     urlLink Common People  and  urlLink Disco 2000  are probably the most popular songs within the album -- other than the fresh tone and rhythm, what hidden in the song is thereally witty but also ironic. With the most unique British voice since David Bowie, Jarvis Cocker mixed all the experimental elements and distinguished PULP from any other Britpop bands.     That was 10 years ago? Oh GOD! I feel I'm old now.....

       urlLink  Nixon: It's dirty pool      Reading this news made me almost have my dinner flying out toward the monitor.   WHAT A RIDICULOUS LEAGUE. No wonder no one likes   urlLink  Bud Selig   !         "Commissioner Bud Selig is the dark lord of Major League Baseball. He tried to kill two teams last fall, and this summer he has sworn not to give into the player's union, even if that means provoking a season-ending player's strike. Fans, reporters, and players hate him. Even other owners hate him. Clearly, the man must be a genius."    --- David Propson in flakmagazine.com (2002)        Oh man...

      This is such a great article, however, I could only find the translated version in  urlLink Traditional Chinese  and  urlLink Simplified Chinese  .   The author of this article, Nahoko Takato, a 34 year-old volunteer worker, helped street children on the streets of Baghdad.         "Even though I was abducted, I don't hate Iraq. I will come to Iraq again,"    "I had to endure unpleasant things. But I cannot hate the Iraqi people," a teary Takato told an Aljazeera reporter.      As everyone knows, the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made such response:    "A great number of government officials made efforts to rescue them when they were in captivity. How can they say such a thing? I want them to think about their circumstances."    This whole incident just became like a rolling snow ball and the conservative Japanese society started to view these hostages as the shame of Japan.  urlLink The New York Times  had a very good article about this issue.     When the doctor told Ms. Takato she had done good work in Iraq, she cried convulsively and said,  "But I've done wrong, haven't I?"      What Ms. Takato did is absolutely courageous and admirable.  I might have commit harakiri myself if I were her. Instead of hiding in the safe zone, she chose to stand up, and wrote what she had experienced in Iraq, and share it with the world.     ææè¦ºå°èªå·±çèé«éç¶æ²æè¢«é£äºæ¿èæ­¦å¨çä¼æåäººæ´»æ´»çæ­»ï¼ä½æ¯æçå¿å»è¢«æ²ææ­¦å¨çæ¥æ¬çµ¦çæ­»äºã  Even though I survived from the armed Iraqi forces, but my heart was murdered by the unarmed Japan.     I wish I had time and much better English skills to translate what I read in  urlLink here . This is not a story about Takato, it was a FACT telling you how beautiful human nature is -- even for the angry Iraqi people.    This is an amazing news (I won't use the word "story" since it's MUCH MORE than one). Hopefully they would translate it into English soon. If you know me in person, I'd love to do oral translation anytime.     Tell me, what we could do to help people get the courage of putting down their arms?

      This morning, I was trying to save some of my old writing (in Chinese). And I think it might be a good idea to keep them in another  urlLink chinese blog .   Those are REAL stories happened to me, and whenever I read them, everything is still so vivid. The actual story line is way better than the Korean love Drama -- it's those "Madison Bridge" kind of love that you could remember that for the rest of your life.    I am glad that I was in love, and the greatest part is that someone loved me more than anything else in the world.    If you ever chatted w/ me through IM or use Yahoo account, Namisy would be one of my common handling.  I used to use the English name Daisy and his name is Namhoon -- we always shared two account together: Namisy and Dahoon.   I used to think about deleting all namisy accounts since we were not together anymore, but I realize that was part of me already.  Without him, I would never be the same as who I am right now.      Looking at the sky will bring me back the thought of you  --- although things will never be the same without you.

      I read this old email from a friend in 1998.  Reading it again 6 years later, I somehow realize what she meant.     If someone's success makes you slight, uneasy, or critical, examine what's behind you reaction. You are not diminished when others succeed.Your life is not a competition with them.  If your dreams fall apart, sweep up the pieces and save them. Sliver of hope can be found in the debris of shattered dreams.      I am thankful that I had this chance reading it again at this moment. It meant a lot to me.

      The Sox is doing great this week playing at Fenway Park, and I do feel the same way getting back to Boston â the place I would consider as my second hometown.   One of the biggest connections of Taiwan and Boston might be âbaseballâ. I might keep the image of the âperfect Asian-ladyâ preparing tons of food and being a âmanâs bitchâ the Super Bowl, but when it comes to Red Sox and Chinese Taipei Baseball team, I am turning into those crazy fans jumping, yelling and non-stop cursing in front of the screen.       Reading " urlLink Leaving the Past Behind " reminded me about my first baseball experience.     Growing up as the only kid in the family, I did not really have chance to know anything about baseball.  urlLink Barcelona Olympics 1992  was pretty much the year getting me into baseball, because that year, our Chinese Taipei won the silver in baseball.   I remember at that time, I was so not literate in baseball. The commentary guys on TV were actually horrible, but I learned my way to understand the rules. Just like most of the girls, I got into baseball simply because my patriotism, and also because I was IN LOVE with one of the pitcher.   After the wonderful summer Olympics, I started to âlistenâ to the major league broadcast (well, we did not have cable at that time because my dearest dad did not want me to get distracted from STUDYING HARD). I could not distinguish from strikes to balls, and could only picture those in my imaginative mind.   However, I was young, and itâs so easy to kill a kidâs mind by disappointing them. The overwhelmingly gambling scandal just extinguish my growing fire through the only professional sport I like.   I was indifferent toward baseball for around 10 years, and almost forget all the basic for baseball.   On my 25th birthday (Oct. 8th 2003), I was at home having dinner with my housemates. I turned on the TV after the dessert and there was the first ALCS game on TV. Wakefield vs. Mussina in Yankees Stadium with a big homer by Ortiz â that was my very first Red Sox game. Have you ever had that âlove at the first sightâ? Thatâs what happened to me with the Red Sox.   Itâs a team with âteamalityâ â they are proud of the history, talent but somehow just get screwed up for being lazy or unfocus. Under the pressure of curse, they still believe in themselves and never give up. Thatâs the spirit of a team, and thatâs the spirit you would find in me. Professional sports  urlLink isnât just ALL ABOUT WINNING  â thatâs another thing I realized through the Red Sox. Pokey Reese, my favorite player in the team, shows how much he enjoys being there every single moment. Most of the players over emphasize how much money they could get from the club house, or how many CY Young, Gold Gloves they could get, but they forget the most important thing: the spirits! Even though we also have greedy âshow me the moneyâ players and whining babies in the Sox, but overall, itâs a team doesnât need BALCO to build up their muscles, or outrageous money to build up more diamond toilets in their houses. Most of all, they have the most fantastic fans in the world â and I am really proud to be one of them.   Also, this year our National baseball team is going to play the  urlLink Athens 2004 Olympics , and hopefully this would rekindled more young spirits towards baseball.     Itâs not just about winning, itâs about the spirit!    Here are some Taiwanese Baseball References:   urlLink Teams investing in Taiwan: Dodgers, Mariners among those building relationships    urlLink Taiwan: a home for second careers

        urlLink Passion  and  urlLink Compassion      This title is sort of funny â Iâm sitting somewhere at  urlLink Starbucks  while the guy sitting right next to me is studying his  urlLink GRE  verbal.     In the past couple of months, Iâm really sensitive to the word âpassionâ. Finding someone you really like having a profile on " urlLink passion.com  (aka.  urlLink Adultfriendfinder.com )" could be one of the unpleasant a girl could endure â which could be worse if you love him.   People suppose to have passion to everything â towards life, work, family, people, and of course, some lust. Maybe due to the image I tried to maintain, or maybe because of the cultural background of traditional and conservative Taiwanese family, I was angry about the whole â urlLink passion.com â. I did not realize what was wrong with it, and simply just spend my energy cursing the people there, including the one I love (yes, it was that bad, I love him and I could not find any reason why I love him).   Sexually frustration and self-denial could be the reason. It is never easy for me to keep this innocent image and totally let go during the âbed timeâ. Or, it just that I havenât found anyone trustworthy and could totally let me forget about anything but lust in bed. Maybe deep deep deep down, I am a faithful  urlLink Catholic  girl, and always feel guilty about it.   However, God is always gracious, and it comes with  urlLink compromised solution  â human anatomy that is. If I am not comfortable with myself, how could I be comfortable with my significant other? And I really should stop that âinnocent Asian girlâ image since it not ME, itâs someone expected me to be. Still, I do not know how could the  urlLink âbig oneâ  gonna think, but Iâll pray and ask him what to do. Time is different, and Iâm 25 years old single female who has her crazy hormone moments from time to time (Amen, sisters!), and it's so hard to resist the outside temptation in this crazy world. I was not born like this, but the chauvinistic cultural background converted me into this âJapanese pron star innocent lookâ kind of behavior. You would know what I am talking about if you ever seen one of those.   So, I decided that I need to know myself a lot more (in every way) and I need to be VERY HAPPY of who I am and just simply BE MYSELF without worrying what would other people think. If people around me really love me, they would love me no matter what I do (within a reasonable range).   Sunday, I had my routinely date with Father John Unni at  urlLink St. Cecilia , and every single words he said just rocked my world. Compassion is the topic for today. It was not easy for us to admit that we did things wrong, and itâs even harder for a priest to admit it to a group of Catholic people during the mass. Even  urlLink the most beloved priest like him , has his tired and indifferent moment and forgot to help our neighbors.   To give compassion, reaching out to the world, passion and self-loving should be the first step. Just like I mentioned before, if I am not comfortable with myself, how am I going to establish a relationship with people? Being comfortable with yourself doesnât mean to dress yourself up with nice name brand outfit or decorate yourself with fancy degrees or getting good physical image, it all happened in your mind. ( urlLink Phone booth  is actually a really good movie talking about this topic).   Despite the frustrated relationship with boys, I am still so loved by the people around me. I always have the courage to be so open up and TRY to love our neighbors â because I have the strongest support from God, my family and friends. However, I am far from being a compassionate person. Do you always help people out whenever you see the needed? I ignore them whenever I am tired, in a bad mood or in a hurry, and sometimes I am just scared to be different from everyone else. There is still part of me not happy with myself and holding me back.    Is it why God sent me this most impossible man for me to love and made me learn? The picture is getting clear and I do discover more and more about myself and started to accept for who I really am.   And you know what?  I think  I really like myself !    Thanks to thy Lord! (Right at this moment, Starbucks is playing some song âyou are raising me highâ!)

      When I first see this website, I was like... HA!  This is so "Yankees".  Check out the so called "Smart Networking" school list -- almost MOST OF THEM are so called "my parents need to pay $40K a year" kind of schools.  Well, maybe not really for the European ones (maybe 40K Euro instead, German/French ones are free - except business schools). But what's interesting was why would people think their schools are the "MOST SELECTIVE" colleges and universities?   Do these "elites" really need to distinct themselves from others to prove that they TRULY are the "A-List" type of people?  I am not being bitter or whatever because my school is also in that "MOST SELECTIVE" school list -- which I found it really dumb.  This site had a good intention for alumni networking, but it advertised in a wrong way.  First of all, if you want to gain membership and make money, you have to target at the right customer.  And now here comes the problem -- how many power net-surfers would register in this site if their schools were/weren't in the "LIST"?  And how many of them will be willing to pay for the membership?  Of course you could think this way that since all these kids went to really expensive school would probably willing to pay more, but here comes another question -- how many of them would possibly become unique user of this site?  (Okay, I am not really making any sense here, but if you really want to know what I mean, email me and I'll draw a graph to make you understand.)     NOT even mention that site is user-unfriendly and super "exclusive" in every single ways.    Internet suppose to break the barrier, but  urlLink Smart Networking  fielded up this "glass ceiling".      COUNTRY CLUB on the net, that would be it!

           Love is a game. Easy to start. Hard to finish.   The first time I watched it, I was still in high school and knew nothing about love.   Now, I'm 25 years old, about the same age as the main characters in the film -- and of course, I do see this film much more different than before.   Other than the Alice in Chains  Soundgarden playing LIVE in the film and the background of Seattle Grunge (featuring Pearl Jam and my beloved REM), the whole twenty-something stories seems to be part of my life.  By changing a location, the whole Janet wondering calling Cliff or not scene happened in my apartment almost every single day (even though now I have no such a problem anymore).  The weird hand-shaking scene of Linda and Steve when Linda getting off the ship from Alaska happened to me not a long time ago in Manhattan.    I am not sure if I truely am a girl or not, because playing "GAMES" is just not my thing. I follow my heart and try to be as open up as possible -- which constantly lead me to be hurt from time to time.  Plus, dealing a guy coming from a totally different culture is another thing I need to adjust.  Maybe I am too used to "maintaining" this "perfect Asian girl" image and sometimes forget who I really am.    Looking back at my past relationships, did they really love me or they just loved my "image" instead?     There is one of my favorite scene that the plastic surgeon Bill Pullman was telling Bridget Fonda that she is perfect and she does not need to get breasts enlargement -- he should like who you are.  It sounds simple, but it does not sound that pleasant to most women.    Are you his Miss Right or just Miss Maybe?      Other than Love, stress from work is another point of the film.  Some of character in the film having multi-jobs at the same time and also need to face the loan and job searching problem.      Perfect timing for me to watch this movie, I guess.

       urlLink ESPN.com - MLB - Neyer: Fenway Park vs. Yankee Stadium    urlLink Times stands still at Fenway    urlLink Stadium mystique makes up for mistakes   Recently I've heard about comparisons of Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium -- from public transportation, food, hotdogs, restrooms and $$$.  As a "Fenway Faithful", I enjoy every single game at Fenway Park, no matter how the final scores are.  I just found this article interesting because it actually reflected a small part of my thoughts -- just a small part.  However, what I like about Fenway ths most is that it provide all the statistic numbers on its huge big screen instead just putting some stupid player pictures and ads all over the ballpark.  After every single pitches, the "FLEET BOARD" would actually tell you the pitching speed, type (fast ball, change-ups...etc), strike percentage and ERA.  I remember I went to see the game on 5/30/2004 in Fenway with SEA Mariners and Raul Ibanez hitted a homerun from Keith Foulke.  Right after that HR, Foulk's ERA increased from 0.8?? to 1.2?, and the number just kept slowly going down after Keith back to his tough state.    Oh well, if you are truely a baseball fan and know something about math, you would probably enjoy reading those numbers as much as I do.

      I thought Barry Zito was the hottest pitcher in MLB, but I totally changed my mind after my short conversation with  urlLink Lenny DiNardo .   There were some great stories about the batting practice of the Red Sox in Yankees Stadium -- mostly pitchers. Pedro, Schilling, K Foulke and A. Embree: I was lucky enough to see them THAT close with some short conversation -- sometimes it's good to be a female baseball fan.  :)    I will write something more maybe after I finish my draft of thesis first.

      It's interesting why would I put these 2 movies together. There is a connection between the two -- George Bush Jr.  The Day After Tomorrow is a movie about global warming -- which easily reminds everyone the "Kyoto Protocol".  In 1997, this agreement was signed by Clinton government, EU members and Japan in order to combate with global warming.  However, in 2001, President Bush rejected this agreement simply because he thought it unfair on the United States, as it leaves out developing countries.    But, who is  urlLink the world's biggest carbon dioxide polluters ?   Maybe that's why before this film released, NASA sent an internal memo stating that no employees were allowed to comment on this movie.  And another trivia part of the movies is that the director actually insisted that the vice president in the film needed to be physically resemble to Dick Cheney.    As for Fahrenheit 9/11, I don't think I need to mention too much about the Anti-Bush part (since everyone knows about it). Still, there are some other background of this film people should know.   Michael Moore actually interviewed Nicholas Berg (I believe everyone knows who he is). I think Moore showed some heart by removing the sector from the documentary. I always think his work "over-ambitious" and trying to hard to sell his version of story -- even though he indeed is a great story teller (aka director).   Maybe a lot of you knew about the SciFi book  urlLink Fahrenheit 451 , and Ray Bradbury's claim for Moore's appropriating the title.  According to Moore's spokesman: "Mr. Bradburyâs work has been an inspiration to all of us involved in this film, but when you watch this film you will see the fact that the title reflects the facts that the movie explores, the very real life events before, around and after 9/11."  "Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns,â while Mooreâs subtitle is that âFahrenheit 9/11 is the temperature at which freedom burns."    However, Fahrenheit 451 was also adapted into film in 1966 (directed by FranÃ§ois Truffaut).  Fahrenheit 451, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968, directed by Stanley Kubrick) and Alphaville (1965, directed by Jean-Luc Godard) are the classics among all SciFi films.  There is also another interesting story about Fahrenheit 451. Ray Bradbury wrote the original manuscript of "Fahrenheit 451" on a rented typewriter which made the novel really easy to read due to the rent of the typewriter.     Alright.. enough crap about movies.   Hopefully I'll get to watch Before Sunset soon.  :)

      There is this famous quote in this film:  Hub: Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love... true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.    This is a simple movie with 3 great actors: Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment.  It might looked odd but an amazing team telling you this story full of hope and joy.  This is not a difficult film but light flavor and meaningful.   Just like the title of this blog: Every Ordinary Life is Extraordinary.

           Drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep, so I can dream fast.     I still remember when I was in  urlLink National Chiao Tung University  , there was this Jim Jarmusch's film called "Night on Earth (1991)" .    Simple cinematography with hidden images, contrast and theatrical conversations are always the symbol of Jim Jarmusch.  It was pretty much the same for movie "Coffee and cigarettes".    Imagine Tom Waits and Iggy Pop sitting down in a diner in California, talking about the coffee in IHOP, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan and Bill Murray having tea/coffee,  urlLink the White Stripes'  Jack and Meg White doing some engineering experiments while having cigs in a coffee shop right next to the machine "Cigarettes 9", and Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. The short pieces of this film is deep, somehow with some hidden sadness and slightly sense of humor.  It did reflect a whole part of the reality in an ironical way.  All those short films are independent, but somehow has connection other than 2 addicted elements: coffee and cigarettes.   Another thing you might want to pay attention to the film is the contrast of the color (even though it's purely black and white). However, there is much more hidden in every single scene -- every coffee cups, spoons sugar jars, cigarettes... everything had its own implied messages.  One thing I found the most interesting is the part for "twins", where Steve Buscemi and Cinque and Joie Lee (Spike Lee's siblings) -- during the entire conversation, the coffee table was a complete chaos and kept reflecting the inner mind of the two twins. Even though they are twins with same style of clothes, shoes and haircut, they are very different personality-wise.  Joie always had the black coffee and rolled her own cigs while Cinque always had it with sugar and milk, and had the cigs from the pack. Racial problem is hidden in this "Twin" short film as well -- ironical enough having Cinque Lee and Joie Lee to participate in this great contrast of "Elvis Twin" image. Also, I was wondering in "Twins" segment, where did the coffee pot went and how did Joie got her coffee refilled?    It's really a great and fun movie of Jim Jarmusch.  I think I might have to watch "Nights on Earth" again.      Cigarettes and Coffee, Man... That's a combination.

       G. Bush Jr. is the smartest US President,  Osama Bin Laden deserves Nobel Peace Prize,  William Hung is the best singer,   Paris Hilton is a virgin,   Winter in Boston is warm,   Yankees is the greatest baseball team,   Francona is the best manager,   and I am a fucking genius!

      I always told people that I went to "Traffic School" as undergrad i Taiwan. The word "Chiao-Tung" means "traffic" in Chinese Mandraine, however, for some people, it's a name of proud and great memories.  It was known as the "paradise" for girls, since  urlLink NCTU (National Chiao Tung University)  is such an engineering/science oriented school, and the male/female ratio is 7:1 - which means, I could pretty much date 7 different boys when I was in undergrad. Also, in the previous decades, NCTU alumni had worked in the industrial park, pushing Taiwan into the competitive market of semiconductors, electronics and computers. Acer group, UMC, Micronix, Santak, TSMC, D-Link, Synnex...etc, more than half of them were founded by NCTU alumni. It is also known as the nerdiest school in Taiwan, and all graduates easily get tons of job oppertunities before graduation. Even if you graduate as an Enlgish major,  ANY  NCTU students at least have the skills working as MIS, even for girls.  Before getting into college, I could not even type. But right now, I guess I could still easily get a MIS job if I do not ask too much $$$ (worked in internet/media start up for 2 years). I guess I did learn a lot in NCTU (except chemistry, which was my major).         Yesterday, I got one song through the internet, and the title is " urlLink NCTUer ". I was reading the background of the song, and realize the composer of the song was one of my ex sweet heart. I still remember the days...whenever he saw a piano available, he would just sat down and played music and made some songs for me. He was a genius, and he still IS.  I don't remember why I broke up with him -- he was everything I ever asked for: very good looking, similar family background, political point of view, same hobbies (movies, music, politics, internet, writing, art...). And not only he loved me, his parents loved me too.  Yesterday was the first time I felt for his music -- maybe that could explain why we never worked out years ago. Years later, his music is getting much more mature. I am glad that he finally made his decision giving up his computer science degree and embraced the true passion in his life -- compose. He was born for that.     One day, he will shine like a star.

       urlLink Nomah was kidnapped!   I was laughing so hard when I read this news. Where was that store again? Broadway in Somerville? Haha... isn't that the one next to the  urlLink Pinis Pizza  and  urlLink the Wangs Fast Food ?  But Nomah is gone. *sigh*.... I'll write a bit more about the trade a little later, BUT.... I was reading on some  urlLink Taiwanese Red Sox Forum , and one Taiwanese kid from UCLA ( urlLink Dodgers  fan because of  urlLink Chin-Feng Chen ) was saying:  The RedSox Clubhouse people are chicken. After the deal was done, they just went on vacation and let some "part-time assistant" or "secretary" holding the press conference....  Alright. This kid totally beat me. THEO, a "part-time assistant"? I was laughing so hard and almost fell out of my chair, AGAIN! I guess you don't really need a JD degree to be an assistant, right?  HEY! But  urlLink Paul DePodesta  isn't that much older than  urlLink Theo Epstein  (like a year older)? Aren't they both young, good looking, talented advocates of  urlLink MONEYBALL ?  Talking about Theo, I've seen Theo in person one time in Fenway. He was talking to some people while standing RIGHT NEXT TO ME on  urlLink 7/24/2004  (Saturday afternoon game with MFY plus an awesome fight).  I was thinking, who is this punk wearing a black jacket without the lable and acting like an expert -- must be some chicken MFY fans doesn't dare to wear their pinestripe Jerseys. Theo was standing right next to me for like 15 mins. I looked at this face, he looked really familiar, but I just could not remember who he was. After processing though all the hotties database, I just realized he was THE ONE, THE ONLY, THE HOTTEST DUDE in bean town: young, SUPER HANDSOME, educated, and he's Red Sox's GM! Plus, he got the chance going to Schilling's place during thanksgiving and wash their dishes! How HOT could that be!     MmmmMmmm... THAT'S my man. :)      As soon as I realize who he was, he got into the field and walking into the GREEN MONSTER.      =(

You are not diminished when                                      others succeed. Your life is not a                                             competition with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If your dreams fall apart, sweep up the                                        pieces and save them. Sliver of hope can                                       be found in the debris of shattered dreams.                                                                                                                                                                                             ==  å­å¹´éå¾ååº¦çå°éç¯æç«  å¿ä¸­çæè§¸ç¹å¥æ·±å»å§.....
