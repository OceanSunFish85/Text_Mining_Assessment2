      So I finally found a school that  one:I like two: offers the subject that I like three: offers that subject under a degree heading that NASA will allow UTTERLY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!  How does Master of Engineering in Applied Remote Sensing and Geoinformation Systems sound? Pretty groovy! And the best part.....to move from South Carolina to Michigan will cost me less than 300.00. That's almost half of what I paid moving from Mississippi to South Carolina and that was 200 miles shorter that the Michigan trip. WHOA! So I am, needless to say, extremely excited over this change in events. Now I just have to go home and check my official NASA AST listing to see if that works. I will also have to contact Marco, the head guy in the Earth Science Application Directorate (ESAD) to see if they would consider a flip/flop co-op rather than a parallel. It's possible. (we can hope!) Also, I need to check with my grant lists to see if there are any for that particular area. (prayers...............many prayers) ;)

       Well...I'm officially done with my project and now it's time for the really hard stuff. Now I have to work on my paper (ugh). Luckily, I am using the team powerpoint presentation and I can create my posterboard from that. yeah!!!! But now I'm seriously at a roadblock on this paper thing. I have 23 pages worth of notes from what I did this summer step by step plus the powerpoint presentation and even Margot's master's thesis for help. But I am still drawing a blank. I know what I want to say but I just don't know how to start. SO FRUSTRATING! &gt;:(

      Well this week is going well!! lol I just paid my tuition and fees for the fall (3308.00 to be exact) and I had the thought that I would add 500.00 onto my Carolina card for my books....so I am currently out of pocket..... 3808.00. That leaves me with 4700.00 to pay off my back rent and find a new place (major UGH)...but Forrest is my baby and I love him...so a new place I will find.

       So...on continues my good week. So, I finished my soil protocol class which means that I am certified in two subjects to teach K-12. Although in the eyes of the trainers, I am in graduate school. The faculty that introduced the classes to us informed them of that so that we could participate (they needed bodies) and also that we were teachers (TAs, I guess) so that we could get the  really cool  bindersand stuff.  Anyway... what was really cool was that I was offered a job at Virginia State during my training. One of the faculty, Shoeba, told me I needed to come there and take her place (totally COOL!!!). She wants someone she can train before she retires. Of course, I'd have to finish grad school first and then I could get my Phd while studying under her. But it's always an option. I figure I'll work and finish school and then I'll give her a call and ask if she is still looking for a replacement. It might be fun and she is also the Grand Master when it comes to getting grants....so there is much that I can learn from her. I am excited!!!! Hopefully next week will be just as fantastic!

       Just a bit of good news for everyone. I have completed my class onhydrology protocol with GLOBE. I am now certified to teach hydrology to kids K-12. I will be getting a certificate for hydrology and for soils (which I'm taking tomorrow). These should total my NASA certificates to 6. That is so COOL!

       Today was AWESOME!!!!!!! I talked with the Geography guy who's here at NASA from USM (University of Southern Mississippi) and asked him if there would be a possibility that I could do some research for USM from USC. He started to balk at the fact that if I didn't go to USM for my graduate work, then they would be out of grant money. So I told him that money wasn't important....just the fact that I would be conducting research would be enough. It nearlyBLEW his mind. :) Also, he introduced me to the gentleman who will be teaching the GIS/Remote Sensing classes here on site and it turns out that he just graduated (in May) from USC with his Phd. So we had plenty to talk about. Then it turns out that the Geography guy graduated from KU (BOOOOO!!!!)..lol... so we got to talking about Kevin Price (who was his advisor) and his research projects. Totally cool
