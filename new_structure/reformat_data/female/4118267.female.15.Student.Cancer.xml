       Mmkay... well ujournal is going crazy and I can't post on it and Becky says that like my uj is screwed up itself, SO... I made this here blogger whateveryoucallit and so it might be temperary? Who knows... I just wanted to post my La Honda entry SOMEWHERE so yeah...       Ok so I wrote this a while ago... yesterday...      Must state the obviousâ¦ must state the obviousâ¦ okay! Iâm baaaaaaaack! Woohoo! Yippee and Iâm here to stayâ¦ that is until August 12th when I leave for Philadelphia for my cousinâs weddingâ¦ yay! But yeahâ¦ La Hondaâ¦  I guess Iâll start from the beginning. Ummâ¦ first of all my classes were:  Sr. Choir Sr. Orchestra  Lunch  Jr./Sr. String Ensembles Sr. Art  Yepyepâ¦ So like I love Choir in some ways cuz Shawn is just the cutest little thing ever. Heâs the choir director hahaâ¦ but heâs gotta be the most adorable 30 year old Iâve ever met. Ahahahaâ¦ and so yeah me and Fern, Bill, Sam, this girl Anna who I just met today, and this other girl I donât know all played with the choir for this one piece. It was raining though and so my poor violin is soakedâ¦ ugh and Iâll hafta fix that hehâ¦ but it was still really fun oh yesâ¦ and poor Shawn was made fun of at Skit Nightâ¦ it was really cute though haha and I donât think he took it the wrong way. Choirâs so much more fun though than last yearâ¦  Senior Orchestraâ¦ so much to say about that but I wonât. Ummâ¦ I made second chair of the 1st violins which is cool, Fern got first of course haha. Sheâs really nice. Omgâ¦ the conductors Vince and Kate drove me crazy the whole weekâ¦ I wonât say anything more thoughâ¦ it just made me miss Villa a little bit. Just a teeny bit. Lolâ¦ so yeah the concert went well tooâ¦ some pieces I barely played though cuz I was too busy holding up the music from blowing away with my bow. Ugh that damn windâ¦ but yeah I just love the cello section. Theyâre so cool manâ¦ or likeâ¦ at least the first stand cuz those are the only people I know lol. Sam and Bill. Awwwwâ¦ adorable Sam. Heâs too cute when he plays. And little Billyâ¦ heâs pretty cool. Vince always calls him Billyâ¦ thatâs so sweet.  Omg! I just loved our ensemble group. It consisted of: Fern, me, Katie, Sam, and Bill. I swearâ¦ I think Iâve been in everything this year at La Honda with Fern, Sam and Bill. Itâs like we come in a package. When one of us is playing in some ensemble, all of us are playing. The concert went well for that, too. I played 3 numbers, which is like a lot, but Fern played 4 so haha. Lol yes, and I got pictures too but thatâll come later. We played this weird Schubert piece I thinkâ¦ and then this âSong of Octoberâ where the second violins fell off the stage during the performance *eek!* Laugh Out Loudâ¦ and then that one famous Brandenburg Concerto where like everyone played and it was so cool.  Uhhh and then Art. Nothing much to say. Itâs pretty much self-explained. Well not really but thereâs just nothing to say about it.  For Skit Nightâ¦ omg I just loved our skitâ¦ it ended up pretty stupid though and we got second to last place, and uhhâ¦ the last place people got âGongedâ or disqualified. Heh. But yeahâ¦ I thought it was cute at least.  Man thereâs really not much else to say. I can just see everyone going âOh darnit! *Snaps fingers*â when I say that haha. And yeahâ¦ so that was another year of La Honda.  Angela got a ujournal! Woohoo!  ~Laurel~
