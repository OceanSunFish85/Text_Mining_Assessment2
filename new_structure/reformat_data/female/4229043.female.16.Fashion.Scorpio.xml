      Regrets  Why expect so much from me? Donât I have the right to be wrong? Why am I so different from them? Finally, it seems like I really donât belong.  To live in a different view That is what I often hope for I canât see which is true My mindâs window or my heartâs door  I donât intend to be in this situation Somehow I regret the path I took Iâm bound with chainsâI canât push through Cuffed with sadnessânow Iâm blue  Being in thisâI canât be fine I wonder why I worry too much Maybe because Iâve grown to this bout So now itâs hard to leave and back out.  I canât escapeâeveryoneâs staring Every step I makeâstill theyâre looking Just for once can I ask for something? Give me back my freedomâmy own precious feelingâ¦

      03132k4  Nth cain  Late night dew drops form On petals waiting to bloom Day break and still wide awake Lying face up on my room Torn apart but standing, hoping to be whole again Scared to act and be knownâwonderinâ if I really can.  It rushed through so suddenly  But I felt every inch of pain Gush of blood, tear in my heart Seem to be the nth cain. Deeply hurt though the feeling is shallow Coz my actions are limited, just bound to follow.  Early morning dew drops lay On petals waiting to bloom Dusk of night just thinking Of a way out of this doom.  Donât rush to be complete  Coz time is a hard thing to meet. There is o reason to be so hasty Coz everything is planned in my own destiny.

      02212k4  happy  months ago I dreamt of you I donât know how and why My dream just flew You were my saviorâ¦ Looking out for me  In reality I never thought of you Not until today, I never knew I never expected Iâd like you But Iâm happy I just doâ¦ You are my lightâ¦ Shining to lead me  Iâm happy just the way this is Though I know you see me differently From a distance I can see you Still Iâm happy, but I wonât hope Coz youâll never be with me  Thinkinâ bout these makes me whine Will my dream ever come true? No one can tell but I thank you Iâm happy you crossed my mind But I know my limitsâyouâll never be mine.

      11282k3  certain  I donât want them to be kept hidden Itâs hard to cover up what youâre really feelinâ Tired of hearing the same old lies Fed up believing these would suffice.  But why do I feel bitter like this? Familiar places, scenes and faces. I thought Iâd be wiser this time around But itâs wrong to presume what I really found.  Iâll have my time I know I will To call my own destiny to fill Forget about what we had back then Coz I donât wanna make the same mistake again.  Maybe Iâm just too afraid to feel But how would I know if this is for real? If Iâd be a stone, would I be happy? This Iâm quite sureâno, I would not beâ¦

      7 30p 11022k3  second flight  for so long, Iâve fooled myself Iâve become so blind, numb and deaf. Canât see reality the way it is Coz Iâm longing to feel what I think I miss  Iâm over you at least I think Flipped my wings to another twig But hanging on to this sight Leads once more to my plight.  Why should it be this way? How come I canât figure this one out? Just tired of dreaming you would stay Fooling myself I won this bout.  But at least I felt it, though painful itâs sweetâ¦ My second flight remains to be Yet another unsolved mysteryâ¦ Or would it really be?

I admit Iâm wrong I shouldnât have hoped so much I should have been contented My aching heart is crushed.  Thank you for the time you spent with me Coz u made me feel complete Thanks for the lesson you taught Hiding behind the pain you caused  Where darkness reigns I know there is light. Though for now I may be broken Soon Iâll be complete again  So stopâ¦ coz Iâve had enough When my heart was torn apart. My eyes are already wide open Iâm certain I wonât be bleeding again.

If only I could see right through you, Then I would know what you really feel, Then I would know what I would doâ¦ Then I would know what to feelâ¦

      10p 08072k3  in doubt  ties that bind us, if they are strong would stand steadilyâright or wrong but why am I feeling weâre rotten inside? Inner thoughts and reasonsâthese we just hide.  How can we dare say weâre gonna last forever If amongst ourselves weâre lost down under Why should we be called as such? If in times weâll just run out of touch.  Minds in difference, but acts as one Hiding forever amounts to none Years that passed will be in vain If we will remain to be the same.  To hear the words stuck inside To see the thoughts in our minds Without the cover, just the plain truth Will set us free from all these foolsâ¦  A piece of me bleeds because I see Reality which seems to bug no one but me Stoned and confused as I am today Wonderinâ if everything will be okay.

      7 30p 05312k3  trigger  struck with a stupid judgment canât believe I have fallen for playful words not meant to hurt but somehow in my mind was incurred  it never really mattered before coz it wasnât exactly what I cared for  but now that I have grown up, something in me says, âitâs enough.â  Humanityâs sense of perfection Is what everyone tries to live up to The standards are set with no options,  Itâs wrong but thatâs what I oughtta do.  Yes, words have that mush power  To swing you to a mind setting But bear in mind it depends on you Whether or not you wanna fit in.  Thereâs a good side too in my case Coz I can somehow have a say Envy has got no more space, And thatâs non-conformity in a way.

      11 40p 05272k3  my heartâs words  itâs hard to admit this but itâs true I have grown farther away from you Stress and pressure just went out of hand Aggravated by your reprimand  I miss the days when Iâm still young When hugs and kisses were precious gems Those moments are already gone And time is hard to fight against  I should have understood both situations  But i acted tough and hard instead Leading to miserably wrong actions Iâm sorryâs not gonna undo what was said  Miles apart our hearts might be But still love bridges you and me Coz our souls and blood are of the same Unconditional love and care remain  Iâm making upfor the times wasted It seems we both are, I have noticed A vivid image of us together Is in my mind and heart foreverâ¦

      1a 05212k3  a need to change  there are too many âIâsâ Iâve said my life, my happiness and my regrets I never realized how selfish Iâve become Itâs always âI and meâ but in âothersâ Iâm numb  Iâm not the only person who is in pain We all get hurt coz weâre just the same Why do I always feel that I am alone? Facing ordeals and struggles on my own  I was blinded by the scene About how things work out to be My mindâs just stuck on me So haunted by my own grief  Acceptance may be a hard task But itâs not too late to learn and start Because itâs worth half the road crossed It rekindles the fire I thought was lost  Things happen for a certain reason What had happened can never be undone The mistakes we did are a part of the past Grieving over should be chosen last.  Love others because of what they are Not because of who they happen to be Just always listen to your heart But have an open mind to see  Itâs wrong to indulge on things you donât need So donât be a slave for lust and greed Be contented but aspire and dream Coz lifeâs beginning is loveâs mainstream.

      11 15p 05112k3  mellow  I never realized that years have passed After the hard work and the sleepless nights I never realized how fast time fleets Until this moment of truth and light  The day when I woke up and sought To learn the whys and wherefores Of my being and my future If itâs too late or too soon, Iâm not sure.  A very long time I was given To reckon about what I wanna be About what Iâm really feelinâ  About what is suitable for meâ¦  Iâm still lookinâ beyond the mirror Hoping to see a sign to believe My search for light is not yet complete So my questâs gonna follow my lead.  Absence of pressure urged me  To be hopeful and become happy I have mellowed but soon Iâll return To the âmeâ I used to beâ¦  Itâs alright to think and reflect for awhile Donât be hasty but donât waste your time Live up your dreams and donât mess with your life Coz it isnât over âtil you give up the fight.

      10 42p 04232k3  my plea  yes Iâm freeâ¦ but how long would I be? Before the walls would be put up Again Iâll stay weary Would anyone please, just release me?  My cell will rearrange Thought my life has changed But Iâm hauntedâ¦ forcedâ¦ pressuredâ¦ Sank to the lowestâ¦ degradedâ¦ flickered.  Iâm happy now and Iâm contented With a simple life left not bothered But it wonât be long before they come And put me where I should be from  Why canât you see, I donât like the way it used to be? Should you be the one to hold the key To my life, no that shouldnât be Coz you donât even know meâ¦ And you donât own me!  Iâve been putting up quite some time now Too much pressure, I canât allow Oh, I really wanna break free From the life which they expect to see  I am just human, I am born to err But is this deed a mistake to consider? If I just want to have my liberty By not being dictated with what I wanna be  Please understand me and do not expect Donât be disappointed coz Iâm not perfect Iâm already fed up with your regulations Itâs now time to standâ¦Iâve learned my lessons.

      3 10p 04092k3  see reality  I woke up and felt the sun Its rays striking ahead  With sleep eyes still not gone As I struggle to step out of my bed  An ordinary day it might seem Same trend, same pace, same light But then I felt a different beam Leading me out from the night  A new hope has come my way The reason to live my life again Beginning with a brand new day Forget about myself back then  Though I donât know my plans for the future At least I am sure Iâm the best I can be Safe and protected; with myself to nurture Certain that I am really free.  Confused back then about the night Afraid of the dim, gloomy trail Because of that I learned to fight Learned to accept to win or fail.  Darkness is not what it seems to be I finally realized that wrong clichÃ© It brings us hope and light to see The right path to head on our way  Use your heart to see reality  That looks might be deceiving  Eyes recognize only outer beauty That is our plightâthe fact in living.

This confession Iâd like to make To be free from my mistakes I donât know if I am to blame But to break awayâ¦ I feel the same

      12 15a 03162k3  still  you came and lit up my life gave hope and stayed by my side felt safe whenever youâre around the reason for my love to abound  when I need help, youâre always there  with open arms to show you care  you let me feel that I am loved youâre an angel sent from up above  why did you have to go and leave? This question in my mind was conceived When everything now is perfectly fine You went away and left me to whine  Itâs different now youâre already gone Give me time to recover and move on I wonât ever forget your memories Because Iâm certain Iâll treasure all for keeps  Time may pass though slowly now People may change, I know somehow Lives may end to form the past But your memories are here to last  Your body may be gone  But your spirit lives on Youâre still in my heart Youâre still the one.

      1a  my solemn death  Iâm sick of living this kind of life Always limitedâ¦ always perfectedâ¦ Sometimes I would just sit back and cry Wishing to leave this place and die  To look in myself in the mirror and see All the great things they wanted me to be My eyes wonât dry I canât help but sigh. Hoping to leave this place and die  Iâm weak, feeble, with no friends and family Is there anyone who would care and take me? Anywhereâ¦ any placeâ¦ just not close by Coz Iâm praying to leave this place and die  Ran out of choicesâ¦ Iâm on the verge of timeâ¦ I should come up with a decision to change this fucking life Though it may seem wrongâ¦ still itâs sublime I have left this placeâ¦ I am free to dieâ¦

How would I ever forget this feeling? If everything around reminds me of you If my world spins around reminds me of you If my world spins around your hands, Well, then I have no longer a chance.  Just one stare then I would fall To hear your voice to hear you call My heart would melt and then Iâd let A whisper of love be left unsaid.  If ever you will notice I hope you wonât change Coz our friendship I donât want to ever end And right now I have come to accept That you and I are never meant.  Maybe it is better left unexpressedâ¦ Hoping my actions would never manifest. Maybe thatâs just our destinyâ¦ Coz you and I arenât meant to beâ¦  Maybeâ¦ maybeâ¦ maybeâ¦

Itâs now that Iâve realizedâyouâre so blunt! But I canât take you outâaway from me.  I canât accept that you chose her over me, Youâre so pathetic I canât believe you could be So right now, Iâm gonna leave you with nothing But misery, pain and pure suffering  Because of the pain youâve caused me Youâre the last one in the world I deserve Iâll forget you, I know, soon I will. So burn your ass in hell--- The Nerve!!!

The answers, only she would know for at this moment, sheâs left with no choice, but to remain silent and have no voice.

The reason why I get myself wrong Thinking that I could be so strong I canât believe Iâm feeling these kinda things It looks like you are being my wings  The reason Iâm stuck here in this fucking place Doing what Iâm obliged to, no matter what it takes Still giving in and holding on Though it seems like itâs starting to get dawn  The reason thereâs rain every time I see her Wishing you would know me but not in blur Trying to be her, but that could not happen Thatâs why right now Iâm holding my pen  Someday, Iâll see myself in your arms  Holding me tight, loving me truly And that someday, Iâll thank this pen For comforting me and for being my friend

      1st year hs  the awakening  i hear a voice crying at naight a sound of grief, of hopelessness everytime, at ight, hearing it signals my end  in the morning light, my fear has gone away as long as the sky is here the sky, it's fragrant... the only thing i want it's fulfillment with no contentment i depend on it.  but when the light is replaced by darkness... fear is residing in my body the voice is crying again... it's scaring me!!!  the sun rose... a relief... but... but... i still hear the voice crying again and again... over and over! "who is it?" the crying did not stop... i feel the voice runnng through my veins it has awakened me...  with the chances in life which i wasted, the tears are still in my eyes the pain still burns up inside it's still fresh in my memory.  the voice gave me hope gave me the will to go on to start again... but whose voice is it? is it his... hers... or MINE?  the 2nd poem ive written,... amateurish... but special..

      12 30 02  deadly expectations  "be good stay on top do your best, never flop" these words uttered to her mind planted since her youth, heard til she dies.  envying the common and simple despite her lucky status in life she's ready to jump down and socialize with those different from her advanced style.  some people idolize her, some hate her others like her, few don't know her they say "she's lucky she's always on top." Despite her achievements, still, on the corner of her mind she seeks her true self and asks why she always does things good and right.  she could not find the answers  hearing these words again, "be good, stay on top do your best, never flop." planted in her mind since her youth... heard til now, she dies.
