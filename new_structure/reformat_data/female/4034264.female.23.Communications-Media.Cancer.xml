      John Kerry ended his speech with the familiar words "and God bless the United States of America."   But the post-speech celebration was missing one thing...the downpour of red, white and blue balloons. My parents and I speculated that the lack of traditional balloonsmight havesomething to do with security.   We suddenly heard "I need more balloons, more balloons, I need more balloons!" And we realized that the voice did not belong to the familiar voices of Wolf Blitzer, or Judy Woodward or Jeff Greenfield. The director of the convention was somehow miked by CNN.   We were amazed that no one had notified CNN that its audience was hearing much more than the convention's background music.   Balloons began to trickle from the sky, but atarather slow rate at first. As the urgency of the director's demands grew, my father commented, "he's going to start cussing soon."   Sure enough, the guy yells, "where the hellare the balloons." Andabout a minute later "what the F*CK are you guys doing up there?"   An apologizing Wolf Blitzer and Judy Woodward quickly tried to amend the situation and explained that was the director of the convention.And soon enoughthousands of balloons and tons of confetti filled the FleetCenter.   Could CNN be theFCC's next victim?

      Men and women in business suits hustle alongWashington's streets and tourists still cram Washington attractions, but in reality the city has come to a screeching halt.  Every summer the city becomes Washington's version of a ghost town.  Senators andCongressmenvanish quickly for a month in their home states.Parking spots still exist after 8:30 a.m. at Metro stops. President Bush isn't even here. Much of what really makes the city unique - and intersting to journalists - have left.  This is my second summer reporting in DC. It's amazing how fast-paced and lost one can feel when Congress is in session. But stories seem to vanish along with the 535 legislators who seem to control so much of the activity that goes on here.  Last week I couldn't even cover all the stories that I wanted. This week I can't think of a single one to write.I think I would have preferred a happy, constant medium.  I know some businesses in Washington's busiest time is DC. But for someone looking for something to write about...it feels like a ghost town.

      Bloggers at the Democratic National Convention have become one of the biggest hypes at this year's Democratic National Convention. The media reportedly hoarded convention bloggers at a "blogger breakfast" this morning.   The collection of bloggers should bring new, refreshing voices to the conventions this year. (Republicans have also agreed to credential bloggers, but not as many as the Democratic convention). Bloggers can provide a real voice that can accurately capture the awe - or lack there of - of the conventions.   The conventions hardly evoke the anticipation they used to when the party's presidential nominee was uncertain. We've known since February John Kerry would be the Democratic nominee. And, hell, we've known President Bush would be the Republican nominee for four years now.   For me, the convention seems to be one big party.   As 15,000 media representatives flood the Fleet center this week, I wonder - why all the hype about this one huge party? I think bloggers can make the conventions more real and more understandable. Through first-person narratives they'll help make sense of all the excitment.   I will cover the Republican National Convention at the end of August for two newspapers. I might find some fun, quirky stories to write about the South Carolina and Mississippi delegations. But what I won't be able to express - is the chaos, fear and downright confusion I am likely to feel.   But these bloggers can do just that. And I'm using their blogs to help me prepare for the Republican National Convention.   A collection of blogs can be found at  urlLink conventionbloggers.com . Check out  urlLink http://www.seetheforest.blogspot.com , for a blogger who's awed by the attention they've drawn from the traditional media and afew photos.

      I've pondered the idea of starting a blog for a long time.  But I wondered...should I start one about my own life? (which is rather boring)  One that I could use as a resume builder and comment on real stuff? (I'm an aspiring journalist).  I don't think I've made up my mind on any of those, but I figured I would at least begin one and see where it leads me.  So hereI go...
