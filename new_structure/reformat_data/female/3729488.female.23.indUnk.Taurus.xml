      went to the christian youth group's movie nite held at this girl's new richmond apartment, for the film "bruce almighty". hmm what, it was in the theatres last yr when i was soo busy with graduation and going to japan, that i didn't have time to go watch the film. saw the trailers at the time tho and it seemed really funny and i had actually wanted to go see it. and later on i heard that it was the best-selling jim carrey movie of all time. but i have to say, it wasn't as good as i thought it would be.. but maybe that's just me. oh well, it was still a funny film, and i really need all the entertainment i can get these days to go out and have fun, so that i can take my mind off from reality.  was so funny to know that the chiropractor friend eric was into 'sex  the city'.. i never know guys would be interested in that series as well! well he's a weird one i guess, haha. kept asking the apartment owner girl if he could borrow all the dvd for the complete seasons. but well, i guess guys could really learn something about girls and how they view sex from that series, so it's good. guys should go see that show! lol  met a girl there tonite tho. she's new to the group like me. it's actually her first time there and she went all by herself, brave~ and she really seems like a nice person and we got into chatting pretty well. plus, she lives in kerrisdale too, so it's really great cuz i can go hang out with her easily since she's so close by. and the other great thing is, she wants to see "Fahrenheit 911" too! so yay! i can go catch the film with her! all my other friends are not interested in a documentary like that. i thought sami would wanna see the film, since she majored in IR and is in law school now and stuff, i thought she'd be interested in this kind of political documentary, and we watched "the corporation" together. but well, so since the only person i know who might have wanted to see the film turned out to be not interested, i had to find those church friends, cuz i know some of them might be the type who'd be interested in this kinda film. and i was rite, someone else there tonite actually brought up the topic, and immediately 2-3 other ppl were all saying they wanna see the film. but huh, i guess i'll go ask this new girl to go see it with me, cuz we live close to each other~ haha  was quite glad tonite actually in meeting and getting to know her, cuz well, whaddaya know, you lose a friend somewhere but you gain a friend elsewhere too~ (^-^)v

      after getting DiorKiss in a hurry, cuz i was sorta already late, then went to pick up sami to meet up with mindy for dinner. found that book "wild swans" at sami's place. about 3 weeks ago i had an interview with a president of a real estate firm. ppl always ask me if i'm chinese or japanese cuz i can speak both languagues. after he found out i'm chinese, he asked me whether or not i've read this book called "wild swans" which i said no.. and he then went on to telling me what the book was about. apparently the grandma had foot-binding and used to be a concubine.. so he was like "well you know, so the warlord locks her up in a room and just goes to have sex with her once in a while".. and i was sorta feeling shocked but also laughing out loud in my mind.. cuz wow, i never ever thought that i would hear the actual word "sex" during an interview!! (^-^);; a friend was like "huh, maybe you would've got the position if you've read the book and know about it!" hah oh well... but it's always interesting to read new books anyways, and this one has been on my mind ever since that interview, so i borrowed the book~ gonna read it on my flight back to taiwan next week.. hah.  had dinner at pearl castle in continental. and hmm... i think i saw a guy whom i just met online this past week. gonna ask him tomorrow where he was tonite to see if it's really him tho.  went to silvercity riverport with sami to catch the film "the notebook" and wow even tho it's a friday nite, the place was soo packed! even more so than the opening nite for Harry Potter!! was quite shocking actually.. and not just for me only. some guy was really surprised how packed the place was too that he came to ask me what film i'm gonna watch.. hah.. but well then later i figured out it's got to be due to "Fahrenheit 911", and my guess was correct! there were TONS of ppl lining up for that film, *way* more than for HP!! i actually really wanna see the film too, being a fan of michael moore's books cuz well i'm anti-bush (even tho i support his stand on tw/china issues being pro tw independence). but well this film can wait.. i'm not in that a hurry.. besides, i don't really wanna watch that kinda heavy material on a friday nite. went to watch "the corporation" on a fri nite and even tho it was a pretty good documentary, i fell asleep towards the 2nd half cuz well 2nd half wasn't as good as the 1st half.. and it was like 10pm-12am.. and i vaguely remembered i had few hrs to sleep the previous nite too having an interview that day.  but anywayz, wow, what can i say for "the notebook"... it's like the best romantic movie i've seen in yrs!!! i totally love it!!! it's going up there in my list of fave movies definitely!!! story was soo sweet and pretty funny too! throughout the whole film there were remarks that made ppl laugh. and the funniest thing happened. towards the end, tons of ppl in the room were crying!! there were all these sniffling sounds.. and when the movie ended, everyone started laughing too cuz it was really funny that everyone was crying!!! (^O^);; probably the most interesting crowd reaction i've seen in yrs~  absolutely love the male lead actor, who's canadian btw, ryan gosling's character noah in the film. i wish there's a guy in reality like that! but i'm not a naive dreamer.. i know guys like that don't ever exist anymore in today's world. still, i'd recommend all guys out there to go watch the film and learn something from the guy!!! it's a must-see!!! and now since i love the film soo much, i'm definitely gonna go buy the novel too!!! have a tendency to buy novels after i watch the movies. cuz well if the movie's good enough, then that'd make me wanna go get the novel. hah~  was really annoyed by the couple next to me tho.. they started making out rite from the start of the movie!! the girl had her legs all curled up onto the guy's body, and the guy's hands were all over her body.. jeeez, if you wanna make out in movies, go sit at the last row!!!! don't sit in the middle~~~ or better yet, just go get a room~~~ aaargh, i'm definitely not gonna sit next to a couple ever again in theatres!!!  on my way driving back home around 12.30am, heard LP's latest single [breaking the habit] on the radio. i love LP, they are no doubt my fave western rock band. and other than GLAY, their fan club is the only one i've joined, well cuz i had wanted to go to meet  greet and to see cutie chester, lol. but well.. having said that, i'm feeling kinda uncomfortable these days, seeing how the record label is sorta exploiting them, cuz well, BTH is their 4th single off their album! usually they're only supposed to release 3 singles off each album! 4 singles are way too much! are they gonna just release every track as singles?!?? not that i'm not happy about releasing good songs as singles, and believe me, all LP songs are excellent songs worthy to be released as singles, but it's still kinda weird.. i dunno.. anywayz gotta call it a nite now. 2am~ good thing tomorrow's saturday and i don't have to wake up early for job hunting!

      got another call back near 5pm. looks like i'll be having 3 interviews next week, which means i'll be having a total of 10 interviews for the month of june. wow~ (^O^)v  then went to richmond centre sears to get DiorKiss lip gloss. apparently it's the one Dior cosmetics branch in the whole van that gets the products at the earliest date! it's really weird too tho, the Dior site, cuz so far only the canadian one mentions something about the new DiorKiss lip gloss (even tho the page isn't really complete)  has been *really* crazy this past month buying cosmetics tho, and no by cosmetics i mean only lip stuff. so far just this spring/summer i've bought the new Dior Addict Ultra Shine lipstick, Dior Addict Ultra Gloss, and now the new DiorKiss... not to mention i've also got both the Chanel new wet shine lip gloss and the lip stick... so that's what, a total of 5 lipstick/gloss?! yah i know i'm CRAZY. but i just can't help it. i love Dior, and i've been using Chanel lip gloss for yrs and they are really great. and of course, i can never resist the words "limited edition"... all the reason to drive me to have to have the stuff now. besides, the new Chanel stuff has cute names like "Miss Pink"... now how can i ever resist that being a Pink Freak?!? other than the lip stuff tho, has also got some Dior/Chanel nail enamels too and mascara... hah... looks like i can't buy any more cosmetics in the near future (^-^);;

      was supposed to sleep at 12am in order to get up at 6am to get ready for the interview at 9am. instead, went to sleep at 2am cuz i got too carried away in IM with some guy friends, asking them for help on how to approach a guy when both of you dunno each other. asking guys really is a lot more help than asking my gal pals.. whom when asked all said dunno cuz we are all alike in being too passive when it comes to guys we like. the advice i got from these guys all seemed pretty good and helpful.. now i just have to put it into practice.. hmm.. well that can wait. these days i don't have the mind for that yet. only got into that topic in the first place to take my mind off a bit from all the chaos, and it did take my mind off, which was good! guess i am really crazy.. talking about that td bank guy always cheers me up~  so then i ended up waking up this morning at 7.30am, frantically getting ready for the interview.. made it at last moment, whew. was so tired on my way driving to there tho. and then i heard OLP's [starseed] on the radio, and the strong beats woke me up a bit.. love the song. tho after the interview, i was still quite tired and kept yawning, so i decided to go get a cup of coffee at bean bros. on my way there the radio played this song called [accidentally in love].. and my does it describe my mood these days.. head over heals for the td bank teller.. lol  came back home and still sent out some resumes and also called a few employers to follow up, even tho i said my job hunting is on hold at the moment. around 11.15am stupid father called... and started yakking away all his fucking nonsense again for goddamn 1hr straight, same as yesterday. i swear i'd go crazy soon one of these days if he keeps this up. why's he torturing me like this by him living and not just go die from the heart attack and end all the misery...  after lunch went out to london drugs to get black printer ink. these days the black ink's used up pretty fast when i'm printing tons of applications like everyday. and then went to drop off a thank-u card at the post office for the interview this morning. hah.. some guy kept telling me to go to td bank today and practice what he taught me to the cute teller guy, and i was like i won't have time today to go there... yet i was already in the kerrisdale neighbourhood twice today walking around..  3pm - just got another call for an interview next tues. so whew, i'll be spending the whole day of tues in downtown again for 2 interviews that day. it's good that i'm getting all these interviews and call backs.. at least made me feel good about myself, tho i'd feel even better if i can get a job offer soon...

      *sigh*  cuz of the possibility that i'll be going back to taiwan too in a week, i have to put a stop in my job hunting. cuz most employers contact ppl by phone, and since i won't be in van to answer my calls, i have to stop, or else they'll just call and leave a msg in my voicemail, yet there'll be no one to return the calls anywayz. i will try to tell them to reach me by email in the upcoming month.. tho it really depends on them, whether or not they'd like to take the time to send an email..   so i was just clearing up all my applications and stuff.. need to re-organize all the files from time to time.. and see which ones i should call again tomorrow and next week to follow up..  aaargh.. i really hate to be leaving van now in the middle of my job hunting, cuz i might have to start all over again once i'm back.. then it'd be like this past 3 months have all been just a waste of time..  oh well, just want to come blog this while taking a mini break.. and will now be going back to preparing for the interview tomorrow. so far this week i have 2, it's been like this for the past few weeks now tho.. bleh~ hmm and there's one next tues too. oh well, even tho i'm holding back my job hunt, still gonna try my best for the interviews i'm getting now!! é å¼µããï½ï¼ï¼ p(^O^)q

      1.30pm - just came back from a 30min walk in the neighbourhood. went out for the walk intentionally to clear up my mind (and well to buy today's papers) but i think it was to no avail. this past 2 days have been completely turmoil.. i feel like i'm still in a daze as if this all isn't really happening. my mind's still a blur.  i feel like i've lost touch with reality somehow.

      got woke up at 8am today by phone call from stupid father. it's now 9.45am and he's still yakking away all his fucking nonsense. and i still haven't even washed up yet.  mom is still on her flight back, estimated 6hrs to land. and i dunno what's gonna happen after she goes back.  i hate time difference, i hate being here all by myself with a sense of helplessness worrying about what's gonna happen and yet there's nothing i can do being a pacific ocean away.

      ......and I'm back to living by myself again, after merely 18 days.  12.22am - just sent mom off to the airport.  was supposed to be just us two spending the summer together here in beautiful van.  12.48am - just got off the phone with mom who's waiting in airport.  i was so looking forward to going to high tea, and dining at those nice restaurants in downtown while looking at the sunset with mom.  or just walking around in the neighbourhood after dinner, looking at those pretty houses and gardens, in the breezing wind and warm sunlight, chatting away.  but now this is all shattered with her back to taiwan.  and this is all thanx to stupid uncle, if he hadn't gone messing around with my even more supid father.  my poor mom.. just arrived in van 18 days ago after some 10hr flight and only got over her jet lag this past two days, is now taking another 10hr flight back to adjust the time difference again.    mom, have a safe flight back, and take some rest, and i wish everything will be ok soon......

      today's probably the most tiring day of this yr. running over the whole city to richmond and then kerrisdale. mom booked the ticket this morning for the flight tonite, and so had to pack the luggages in less than 12 hrs. during all this frustration, the only thing that kept me to still be in an upbeat mood was that we went to td bank kerrisdale today and that the cute teller guy was there. mom got him actually, tho she had me go talk to the investment advisor first so i couldn't be there with her in front of the cutie teller. afterwards i told mom, and she agreed too that the guy is indeed quite nice looking.. and she said that during the whole time she was in service with him, he kept smiling and stuff... ah so nice. sigh, tho i probably can't see him again in the next month or so.. that's a bummer..

      so what, i admit that i'm indeed a selfish cold hard bitch. if there really is justice in this world, you should've already died from your stupid heart attack and be rotting in hell now instead of creating chaos in all of our lives. you keep asking me to share my personal thoughts with you. well, you know what, the source of all my misery and pain is you! if i really tell you that, you'll just be having another heart attack, which i so hope you will. yet i'm just holding back telling the truth to you now cuz i want to wait for the perfect moment. now is just not the right time yet. even tho i'm not sure when's the right moment, i know it's coming soon. and i can't wait for that day to come to be able to see the look on your face when you know the truth, that you are the root cause of my unhappiness.  i pray everyday that why don't you just die...

      due to the extreme boredom with job hunting and the extreme tiredness of the chaos in my life brought on by my stupid father and whatnot, i've gone to look around some sites that provide blogs and decided to come here to set up my first official personal blog...

      *SIGH* got no phone call back from that company i was waiting for today. have to say i was a bit depressed/discouraged. but i really dunno what's up with them anywayz. maybe they just haven't made a decision yet cuz everything's so busy on friday before going into the weekend. or maybe they were so impressed with that other candidate's 2nd interview today that they offered the job to that person first?! i just dunno. mom called eagerly at 5.30pm to ask.. but aaai, no job offer from that employer yet! will have to wait till next monday. if they don't call that day, i'll have to phone in before 5pm to ask them what's up. (&gt;__  went out at 6pm to pick up vivian, the new girl i met at church youth group the other day, and we went to silvercity riverport to see michael moore's critically acclaimed documentary. wow, even tho it's in its 2nd week, the theatre was packed! even the front rows were crowded with ppl! it really is the best documentary i've ever seen!!! but well, i've only seen this and 'the corporation'.. hah. tho compared with 'the corporation' i like this one a lot more. even tho both films deal with heavy materials like capitalism/globalization and 911/war on iraq etc, this film was a lot more humorous and so i like it more. guess ppl just all love to see how idiotic bush is! lol!  love how the beginning of the film about the 911 attacks on WTC was done. was just a total blackened screen with only sounds, and then slowly changed into ashes and tons of papers flying in the sky and onto the ground. he didn't show the actual planes crashing into the towers at all. and by doing so, the impact was stronger. while staring at the black screen and hearing the sounds, it actually made you think of the 911 attacks as the way you remembered it. very tastefully done. and was glad to find out that vivian love this too.  apparently some ppl cried too.. cuz of the emotional mothers whose sons were killed in iraq. yah, very sad scenes. some horrible killing/injured scenes too. but yah, it's a great film, could totally see why it won the best film award in cannes this yr! at the end of the movie, everyone applauded too~ love it~ absolutely amazing film.  a very scary incident happened tho. towards the middle of the movie, this older guy sitting behind me left the theatre. when he was going out everyone in our row turned and looked, tho i didn't know why and what's happening, just thought the guy's going to washroom. but apparently not. a min later he came back in with 2 security guards, to throw out this young guy sitting in the row behind him. he's actually a pretty young looking white trash guy. he got sooo mad and kept swearing at the old guy for throwing him out. but apparently he kept doing that throughout the whole movie so that's why the old guy couldn't stand it anymore and decide to ask guards to throw him out of the theatre. but it was sooo scary when the young white trash was going mad and kept swearing... cuz he's only 2 rows behind me, and i was sooo afraid that he'd go nuts and start throwing things down at the old guy or something, and if he missed, it'd hit me who was sitting like straight down!! was really relieved nothing happened and he finally left~~~ but anywayz the whole incident was just weird.. this old guy sitting beside me was quite confused and surprised too that we were looking at each other exchanging these confused looks.. (^-^);;;  after the movie at 9.30pm, went to rose garden to have bubble tea and dinner. absolutely love the pudding pearl milk tea at rose, it's the best i've tasted anywhere!! love pudding~~ *yum!* shared a gratin with vivian, and it's a pretty good gratin! tho really big, so good thing we shared~ stayed there for 3 hrs, kept chatting. she really is quite a nice girl~ we got into talking about everything, from drama to chinese/japanese/korean/french/italian cuisine, to comix and desserts and etc. really nice chat~ am really happy to make a new friend (^O^)/

      woke up around 8.30am today and has since been waiting for the phone call. i know they told me they'd call this afternoon at the earliest if they make a decision, but still, i wanted to wake up earlier to prepare and stuff. keep waiting... i hate waiting... cuz of that feeling of unknown... (&gt;__  did get a phone call from this global logistics company in the morning tho. few weeks ago i went to the office to drop off my application for a position, and the manager came out to see me and we had an interview right then and there. she was looking for ppl who have a few more yrs of practical experience so i'm not that qualified. but i'm really interested in that company cuz it's a really big global company, so i kept stressing my interest and she was quite impressed with my background and everything so she said she'll pass my resume on to other dept for other openings. and she did! the sales dept has openings and they called me back today for an interview next monday! i accepted the interview, and if i do get a job offer later then i'll decline it~  well, in the meantime while i'm waiting for this possible job offer, i'm writing email to my elementary friend flora. just got her email this morning cuz i sent a letter to her last month after a mini reunion we had here with ellen and johnny. she's asking for advice on law school and national bar exam and stuff, so i wanna reply to her asap. but since i've changed to XP last x'mas, i've been having a really hard time typing chinese now.. it used to be easier and i could type pretty fast using this njstar program under win98. now with the XP IME it's so hard to type and it takes me a freaking long time to type up something decent.. bleh..

      Yay! Happy Birthday to Canada~~ (^O^)/  tho i didn't go to any celebrations today (^-^);; the past 2 days with all the interviews and everything have just totally stressed me out. so just rest in today~ overslept and did absolutely nothing the whole day except eat, read newspapers, watch tv, and of course, blog/IM. it's amazing how i wasted one entire day away just like that...  was supposed to pack and everything if i were going back to taiwan. i really am not looking forward to going back in the summer. the only thing i look forward to is meeting friends.. and well, shopping. have wrote down a whole wish list of the things to buy, like cosmetics, comix, and CDs. and i had really wanted to meet up with my elementary friends by doing a reunion this yr. and also i wanna meet up with debby.. told her i was quite possibly going back and that we'll go watch 'spiderman 2' together (^O^);; now that i'm not going back that's not gonna happen. i had really wanted to go watch movies with her tho, since we haven't been to the movies together after she went back to taiwan to work. hmm the last time we watched a movie together was what, for 'catch me if you can'?!? so long ago.. aaai, next time bah..

      so the 2nd interview was at 2.30pm. since yesterday with the 4 interviews everything was in such a hurry and all, i decided to leave an hr earlier today at 1.30 with estimated arrival time at 2.05. that'd give me ample time to sit in the garden outside of the office bldg to catch my breath and rest. however, since today's such a beautiful day, was soo crowded in the kits beach area so bus got slow and i ended up arriving there at 2.20!! lucky me to have left soo early!! whew!!  met the lady yesterday who had the interview with me first and i gave her the thank-u card. told her i had already written it by the time she called me back so i decided to just bring it in to give her directly instead of mailing it. she was really glad and smiled and said it was really professional of me to do that~ yay! well the interview today with the president went pretty well too. that company's funny tho.. they have pix of everyone on the site, yet no one looks the way in the pix!!! haha (^-^);;  i asked him how many ppl have gone in for 2nd interviews out of those 30 ppl who the lady said she's interviewed. and the guy was like nono, they haven't got that many applications, they got about 30 resumes, and they've interviewed like 8-9. (was really weird cuz i asked the lady yesterday "how many ppl have you interviewed"! she didn't hear my Q correctly?! hmm oh well..) and apparently i'm the first one to go in for the 2nd round of interview! (*O*) he said she was soo impressed with me yesterday she immediately asked me to come back for 2nd interview! and that now it's down to only 2 ppl, me and this other person who he'll have the 2nd interview on friday... and so they might make a decision as soon as friday afternoon! then start work on monday! WOW!!! (*O*) pray pray pray pray~~~ i hope i do get the job offer!!!!!!  after the interview, took the bus back, and again the bus was totally crowded! i ended up sitting beside this asian guy (most likely chinese i later on figured out) who ended up being a complete PSYCHO!!! he started chatting with me by asking me which country i was from... i'm like "uuuh.. i was born in taiwan". and he's like oh he's only asking that cuz he was wondering whether i'm chinese or japanese or... and i'm like "oh yah i can speak japanese too". then he's like "oh is one of your parents japanese?" i'm like "no.. i'm not mixed". these days i get mistaken a lot as either being japanese or being cbc who doesn't know chinese, even at chinese shops/restaurants!!!! see i go in these chinese shops/restaurants and ppl talk to me in english! even if i was with my mom! typically ppl can tell if i'm with my mom cuz she looks very chinese! but well, so i find it quite surprising actually. esp cuz it's happening here. i got mistaken a lot in taiwan and japan, but i've never got mistaken here before actually. anywayz it's interesting somehow i guess.. that ppl can't really tell my ethnicity from my looks, and i'll just have to adjust to that.  well, so the guy kept asking me Q about japanese and whatever and i'd answer him and stuff. then later on he just started talking about himself NON-STOP for like 15min!!!!! was sooo confused at first cuz he said he was framed for 12+ yrs and victimized by the system.. ppl screw him and so he screw them too and blah blah. then i realized he's crazy. later on i figured out he's just NUTS cuz he kept on yakking when i wasn't even replying to him! apparently he didn't care either if i reply or not.. and he talked pretty loud too so ppl in the whole bus kept turning their heads to look at him! aaaargh!!! (&gt;______ (--__--);;;; how was i supposed to know he'd be a psycho anywayz?!??  was thinking whether i should get off the bus or not to avoid the crazy guy. but then i'd have to waste another $2 for bus ticket, and i really didn't wanna do that. (got scolded/laughed at by mom when i told her this tho.. she was like "it's just $2!!!!! you should've totally got off the bus to take another one!!!" hah..) i got a bit scared too cuz i noticed he had like 2-3 super big backpacks.. and i was thinking "what if it's bombs inside?!?" (*____*);;; cuz you never know rite? after all he's a PSYCHO!!!! and i was a bit afraid what if he follows me down at my stop... good thing there's a gas station and a grocery shop at my stop, so there'd be ppl there. so i was like if he really follows me it'll be ok too cuz there're lots of ppl around at my stop. was SOOOO relieved when he got off the bus on king edward. WHEW~~~  anywayz, i was in too much of a good mood today with the interview and the possible job offer that my mood wasn't really trashed by this psycho guy. only felt åæ¥£ç«ç¶æç¢°ä¸çå­... one's already too much in my life!!! ah, and speaking of which, father told me i don't need to go back now cuz there's a typhoon coming. mom finally told him i've been job hunting and i may not go back anywayz cuz i'm waiting for a decision that may result in me starting work next mon. he didn't know i was looking for a job cuz we didn't wanna tell him. he has the idea that i don't need to go work anywayz cuz i can still live off, and so he's just weird. but well finally broke the big secret. even if i don't get the job offer and i can go back, i don't have to now. there's the typhoon and the super hot weather. so YAY! lucky typhoon! haha maybe only to me... sorry to those in taiwan rite now suffering cuz of the heavy rain/wind.. (^-^);;

      AH~ am *so* exhausted rite now that my neck/back hurt like hell. man.. scheduling 4 interviews all on the same day really is way too much. not to mention cuz then i'd have to do research on 4 companies the day before as well. still ended up oversleeping till 7.20am... man i really have to stop doing that!!!! ARGH. last fri when i overslept for my intervew, that was still ok cuz that company's on broadway, only took me 10min to drive down there. yet today i had 3 interviews in downtown, so i couldn't drive there, or else my parking fee alone would cost soo much! so i had to bus there. and these 3 companies are all located near the harbour front.. which means it takes longer to get there cuz more ppl get on/off bus, esp since it was morning rush hr! (&gt;__  had to run/walk to the first interview cuz it was at 9am.. was about 2-3min late (-_-);; had never been late for an interview till now! aah! was always 10min earlier! i missed a bus today so.. wuu. oh well but the interview went fine, i think?! she was still smiling all along and stuff, so i dunno if she really noticed i was a bit late or if she cared.. after the interview went to have coffee cuz i was oh-so-sleepy-tired. had it at 'cafe artigiano' located at the marriott pinnacle. was such a nice coffee shop!! i was there for like 1hr+ and the whole time there was a long line-up! ppl just kept coming in! non-stop! they have this 'latte art' thing which is so cute! they'd put foam on to your latte in the shapes of heart and stuff~ lovely~  2nd interview was with this asian guy. sorta nice looking too, but yay! this time i didn't get nervous that i'd start mumbling! haha! maybe i only get nervous around cute white boys?! (^O^);; but well, it's a tech company, so typically guys work there. after the interview when he walked me out, some other guy came to talk to him and that's a cute guy!! so i'd imagine there're lots more cuties in that company?!? (^O^);; was asked whether or not i know anything about online marketing. and i was like yah i've taken courses that had talked about it. and he's like 'so how would you go about marketing online?' i was like well you can get listed on search engines, and like join an online community like a web-ring or something. and he's like 'oh web-ring! interesting!' and he had this look that's like he was quite surprised and totally not expecting i'd say that. i suppose that's a good thing? so that he'd think i'm creative or something?! but well, this is a summer intern position that i just applied to randomly. didn't think i'd get picked for interviews~ hah.. so well, i'm still more interested in other perm positions, and to tell the truth, yah i really dunno that much about technology (*_*);;  had lunch at bread garden. actually i've never ate sandwiches there before. i've had coffee and other drinks and desserts there, but not sandwiches. but i always thought they'd have nice sandwiches, yet the tuna sand i had today was absolutely AWFUL! (&gt;_  the 3rd interview. heh. this one's quite weird. at the start of the month i saw them post the job position on ubc career site so i applied to it. and one day cuz i was in downtown doing interviews so i went down to the office to drop off the application as well. asked to see the lady in charge and she was so not friendly! she's like she doesn't see ppl who come in. so i left. and afterwards no news from them. this past weekend saw them post the same position in the van sun, so i applied to it again. and they called me back the next day for interview! so i went in today, yet the lady i saw today was so friendly! and she didn't look like the one i saw last time! tho i really can't remember what that unfriendly one looked like either cuz i got a bit mad afterwards when she was so rude. yet both times i asked for the same person! weird huh!  the interview went pretty well. she actually said she remembers me for applying to the position twice, and she said they didn't call me back the first time i applied cuz they thought i was 'overqualified'!!!! (*O*) i'm not sure if it has anything to do with my stated salary expectations tho, they asked for that in cover letter. for my first application i stated quite high cuz i got confused by this stupid survey conducted by ubc commerce career centre. and i just realized last week that those were way too high! so i changed it for my 2nd application. i cleared this up with her tho, telling her about the whole thing.. even tho she said she can't remember what i stated for in the 1st application. later on i asked her how many ppl has she interviewed, and she's like about 30, and i was so shocked. most of the other interviews i've been too, they only interview like 7-15 ppl. so i thought 30 is a lot! and so i asked her how she thinks i rank in those 30 candidates, and she said i definitely rank quite high at the top!  was really happy to hear that and know they think i'm 'overqualified' tho. apparently it has something to do with the fact that i've worked at Fasken Martineau LLP (the largest law firm in van) and Colliers International (the 25th largest private companies in van). the other day this company called me for interview, and in the call, she kept stressing the point that the position is just an entry-level one so she thinks it may not suit me cuz i've worked at such big companies before. and i was like, but those were just summer positions.. and she was like 'oh! now i see on the side that it's summer jobs!' (^-^);; haha.. anywayz, so guess what, 3hrs after the interview, while i was just writing the thank-u card to this lady, i got a call back from her for a 2nd interview tomorrow with the president!!!!!! \(^O^)/ YAY!!!!! ã¬ã³ãã«ã¥ï½ï½ï¼ï¼ï¼ p(^O^)q  after this interview, i had to come back home to drive cuz the 4th one's in richmond. i've never got an interview in richmond before! well cuz it always turned out that the companies i found in richmond are located at the really far side of richmond!! so then i just don't apply to them anymore. but this one i didn't even know where's the company cuz i couldn't find it at all. but i still sent the application cuz well, sometimes i do random stuff~ i should've just turned down this interview yesterday when they called me back to arrange the time tho. have turned down 1 interview 2 weeks ago, again random stuff i applied to, promotional sales stuff, didn't think i'd get picked, so i applied.. heh. but well, yesterday this lady called me with strong accent and poor english.. i realized it's a mainland company but i still accepted the interview. doh.  i was like 10min late when i got there. cuz well, i got held up and left 10min later than i had planned originally. see, when i was coming home from downtown on the bus, i got a phone call for an interview! it was a restricted id call tho, so i picked it up. was SOO noisy on the bus that i couldn't even hear the guy's voice clear enough.. so aaah i didn't know what company that is!! (&gt;___ __  it seemed like it might have been a nice company tho. cuz the guy had nice voice! i'm pretty accurate in figuring out guys' voices. so far all the times i've got guys who were the ones who called me back for interviews, they all turned out to be cute guys in nice companies! even the one this morning with the asian guy! he sounded pretty nice on phone too and yah he's nice looking (tho not super cute). but then i dunno.. this mystery guy/company sounded a bit gay too tho... so haha (^-^);; oh well see if he calls back tomorrow then..   so i was late for the richmond interview cuz not only had i left late, but the building was hard to find within that complex! i was walking around looking for it! aargh! it turned out to be this weird little biotech company that's also new! it's only been in business for 3 months! aah! and stupid mainland ppl! the president was a weird chinese man.. dunno if it was cuz i'm tall and he's short, so when we're sitting down his head's about to my chest height... or the fact that chinese ppl don't feel comfortable talking to ppl while looking directly in their eyes, his eyes were on my chest for a long period of time several times!!! EEWWWW (&gt;______ ___  well, it's now 11pm.. i'm gonna sleep early tonite~ and i'll just do the other things tomorrow morning lah~ \(^O^)/ all in all, even tho it's a pretty tiring day, i have to say it's quite fulfilling too! having so much to do~ heh~

      so it's gonna be a liberal minority. ah well, at least the liberals won, whew. was really glad that the polls were all wrong cuz the conservatives didn't even come close to winning majority! yay! hmm tho we'll all have to see how this new minority govt's gonna work out. it's interesting to see how canada elects tho. the ballots were counted soo quickly! was amazing actually. voting closed at 7pm here in bc, yet by 8pm the majority of the votes were already counted and you can clearly see that it's a liberal win. wow, took only an hr!  stupid father phoned around 6pm to tell me not to go back. what the fuck. i waited till after the weekend to finally call in to confirm with the travel agency and they just sent me the tickets! and now you're telling me not to go back?!?? hah, you think i'd actually *like* to go back?!?? ifi it weren't for you who kept telling me to go back for months and now with this stupid incident, i'd never wanna go back in this blazing weather!!! jeeeeez. and yet half an hr later he called back again saying yah i could go back. DUH.  anywayz have 4 interviews tomorrow. WOW. gonna prepare for them now, still have 2 companies to research. and i gotta sleep at midnight or else i'm gonna oversleep again and that won't be funny this time. and well, GOOD LUCK to myself for the interviews tomorrow!!! p(^O^)q

      just came back from voting. (^O^)v it's the first time i've ever voted in my life. have to say that on my way walking towards kerrisdale elementary school to cast my vote i was feeling quite excited. but well, since it's my first time to vote, i have absolutely no idea how the whole thing works. apparently you take the ballot from the booth person, go behind to a secret booth to mark your choice, then come back to hand the ballot back to the person to tear off something... then you take the ballot from that person to put it into the box. was like a complete idiot ready to walk away after i handed the ballot back to the person, and he's like 'no no don't go yet~' and after he tore off something he gave the ballot back to me, and i put it into the box... and that completed the vote. felt great after voting too~ (^O^)  i voted for the liberals. even tho i really don't like how gordon campbell rules bc and there's the whole sponsorship scandal and whatnot, i still voted for them, cuz well, i'd never vote for the right wing extremist christian fundamentalist conservatives. so my only choices left were the liberals and the ndp. yet ndp is way too small there's really no chance they'd ever win, besides, they wanna do the whole estate/inheritance tax thing, now what the hell is that? apparently they believe that you should "tax 'em dead or alive"... jeeeez. so i'm left with the liberals.  it's quite scary tho, the polls these days all kept showing the liberals and the tories in a tight fight, or the chance of a minority govt. i'm sooo scared the conservatives would win, that'd totally change canada. and a minority govt is just a disaster, nothing good would come out of a minority govt cuz you can't decide anything within a minority. so i'm crossing my fingers here now, for a liberal majority win...  got another call for interview just when i was walking on the road and about to arrive back at my home. huh, i really do have 3 interviews tomorrow (*O*) tho i hate wearing suits on a sunny day... soooooo hot. and the forecast predicted that tomorrow's gonna be at least 24 degrees. aaaargh.

      ah.. so the england team lost. and it was beckham who didn't kick the ball in.. *sigh* poor beckham.. *sob* but well, no matter what, he's still my fave soccer player!!! he's got lots of talent, maybe it's just due to all the pressure he's been getting these days for the so-called 'affairs' that he's not as concentrated as he should've been and so he didn't play well enough. should really give the poor guy a break tho. besides, i don't really believe in those accusations that he's had some affairs anywayz. us taurus ppl are really loyal and devoted once we found the one, for us to betray is just totally unlikely! anywayz, i'll always support ya beckham! love forever!!! *kiss* lol  north americans here are really not interested in soccer. vancouver sun's sports section has like sooo little coverage on euro cup! practually none actually. aargh!! so i have to read the chinese newspapers for updates on the game. anywayz, love the july issue of vanity fair. it's got beckham topless in low-rider jeans on cover!!! *drool~~*  urlLink    David Beckham / Vanity Fair July 2004  he's not just a pretty boy, he's really talented in his soccer skills too. but for soccer games, a lot of the times other variables come into play too, so it's partially dependent upon luck. can't wait for the world cup in 2006~~~ sigh.. had talks with friends during world cup 2002 that we'd go to germany to watch the game in another 2 summers. but aiya.. really dunno how we're supposed to go when there's work and everything else.. *sob* but i really wanna see beckham play live!!! that may be his last world cup to play in!!! aaah!!! oh well... we'll see in another yr how everything goes...

      exactly one week after that whole shit with a so-called 'friend', on the nite of 622 father called twice and mom and i finally realized that something's happened. apparently uncle went to ask father for money to borrow, yet wouldn't tell him what the money's for and was kinda rude in his way of asking. and 24hrs later mom took the flight back to deal with the whole shit, since it's her brother who went messing around with father.  uncle lost money in the stock market. it's sad actually that some ppl just never know their limits. *only* go play in the stock market if you have the money and the leisure to lose, or of course, if you are bright enough and know what you're doing! when you don't really have money, you should know you don't have the luxury to trade in the stock market. besides, it's not like you are particularly bright and know a lot about those complicated financial stuff anywayz, so you're really just doomed to lose no matter what. æçäººå°±æ¯æ²æèªç¥ä¹æ.. sigh. my grandma's sis used to lose money all the time to the stock market as well, and the debt she created cost her daughters to still be paying them back now while they both have their own families to support. stock market is just shit. stupid father keeps telling me to go deal stocks too and i keep putting it off. even him lost a lot of money to the stock market, why the hell can't he learn anything from it? jeez.  was soo mad at uncle that even i had almost called back to lecture him and tell him what his doing had done to mom and me. why the hell he went messing around with father anywayz knowing what kinda psycho he is? was he too naive or what to have never been clued in all these yrs?!? if you want money, ask mom! jeez. to go ask father in the first place without even letting mom know, now you won't even get a penny i tell ya.  over all these yrs i have seen numerous episodes of relatives/friends come to ask father to lend them money. i can just picture it now already that in the coming future, that'd be me, being asked by all my cousins etc for money. it's not that i'm particularly stingy or anything. it's just that i don't like to have money involved in both friendships and family relations. i don't like the fact that ppl just come to us cuz they know we have money. i really dunno yet what i'd do when i'm in that kinda situation. it's not like i will never lend money out to friends/relatives. but i really don't like to have money involved in relationships, any kind of relationships actually.  that so-called 'friend', hah, 2 summers ago tried selling me her direct sales cosmetics stuff. see, now that's involving money into friendship. remembered i wrote a whole long blog about this whole thing on love channel at the time. for friends to be involved in direct selling, there's a conflict of interest. she's in it for the money and well, possibly a little bit for the welfare of friends too to use nice products, but mostly it's for the money. yet the other party's interested in products that'd do them good. i'm not saying she was selling me those cuz she knew i have money; she only tried selling me those cuz at the time we were friends, and first step in direct selling is that you always try selling to your friends/relatives. but then i find it too often destroy the relationship somewhat, or just make it plain awkward. i remembered it was since that episode that i hardly went out with her, cuz i didn't want her to sell me those things again. it wasn't until this yr that i'm back to van that i tried to catch things up with her. but well, now that's off too.  maybe it's cuz of the fact that i'm the only child, i don't really have that sense of sibling relationships. i'm not that close to any of my cousins. not that i really care, but now that i think about it, maybe it's cuz i don't have bro/sis myself so i don't really know how to deal with them. but anywayz, this stupid incident definitely ruined my summer.. cuz now i have to go back to taiwan too to deal with my stupid father. the whole thing's not just uncle's fault, so yah, he's wrong in going to play in the stock market when he doesn't even have enough money and in going to my father in the first place to ask for money, but my father bears a lot of the fault too. it's just a simple thing to either turn him down or lend him the money. why the hell did you have to think of it as soo fucking complicated? jeez.  i just hope the whole thing will be alright soon.. if not before i go back to taiwan..

      have to say that no doubt this past 2 weeks have been the single most chaotic weeks in my life so far. 2 incidents happened, one with a friend and the other one with some family members, which have contributed to my constantly changing views on human nature. really wanna keep a record of all this, so here i am, blogging this all down.  last wed, 616, when i came on icq at nite i got an offline msg and a request for authorization. the offline msg had a mention about sugar daddy, and i was quite confused, but had a bit of a communication problem with the guy whom i later on realized has very poor english, and so he didn't tell me clearly at first what the whole sugar daddy thing was about. started talking with the guy, and then realized he added me from this cv short for chinese vancouver site, which i have never even heard of before that day.  went onto the site, cuz well, if i haven't even heard of the site before let alone ever going there, how the hell could he have added me from there? but i was also talking to some other friends at the time, so i looked thru that cv site really slowly.. and finally realized after like 2 hrs, that some person had stolen my identity and was posing as me on there, using my name  icq, posting up a msg about a virgin looking for a sugar daddy.  had to say i was REALLY shocked when i came onto the pages, both the msgboard page and the person's membership profile page, cuz i instantly realized that someone was trying to pose as me on there. was soo shocked that i blanked out for a min there, cuz i seriously couldn't even think of the person who would do this to me. it wasn't until after i calmed down a bit and looked carefully at my icq list several times, that i came up with a possible suspect. i don't give out icq easily, that's why i have authorization, and well lately, i'm mostly using msn so not a lot of new friends know about my icq. so it must be someone who's on my list and also has me on the list for a while now. plus, i'm not the kind of person who'd make enemies easily or even just get into arguments/disagreements often with ppl, so it really took me a while to try figuring out the person.  it was a she, contrary to what most ppl think would be a guy to post that kind of msg. i really didn't wanna suspect her at first cuz well, she is whom i consider to be a close friend. but we just had sort of an uncomfortable conversation on msn lately, and she's the only one in a long time whom i've had that kind of uncomfortable talks with. so if it weren't her, i couldn't think of anyone else.  i signed up a fake email account as a guy and sent that person an email, hoping to get clues as to who that person would be. and i did get the clue i want. the person replied saying i could add her on msn, and the msn account she gave out, was really my msn account. i use ISP email account with msn, unlike most ppl who use hotmail. so if the person knows my real email address, it really has to be someone i know well. and it really was the person i had in my mind, the one i suspected all along.  i'm like 90% confident of her identity. cuz not a lot of ppl know both my icq  msn accounts. some ppl only have icq, some only have msn. there are only a few ppl who have me on both, and weeding out the ones who're in taiwan and the ones i know who are busy with work and would never go to sites like cv, she was the only one left. and i remembered few weeks ago she was telling me about this site that lets you network with friends' friends and stuff. i asked ppl around and realized later on that it's friendster. and i looked thru that cv site, and apparently most ppl on there, also have frienster too. so she does go on sites like this. it really was her.  even tho i had suspected that it was her, i really didn't believe it until i got that email she replied. i was feeling really betrayed, cuz she was someone i consider to be one of my close friends. yet she backstabbed me like this. it was clear that it wasn't just a sick joke tho, she was really trying to trash me and hurt my reputation. i was really confused as to why she'd do something like this, then i vaguely remembered the uncomfortable chat we had not long ago on msn.  something about i put up a msn nickname that she thought was meant for her, and she got really angry. it was apparently about the bday present she got for me. i already told her that it had nothing to do with her, it was just something i thought of after hearing these incidents with some other friends cuz well lately there's been quite a few bdays and ppl have been all getting bday presents. i thought we had an understanding after the chat and everything was cool. but apparently it wasn't.  after giving some more thoughts, i then realized she must have misunderstood my nickname again, and that must be why she got angry yet again and decided to go trash me on that site. see, i put up this msn nickname calling myself an ungrateful spoiled brat. but that's what my stupid father has been calling me for yrs!!! so it was really targeted to him!  i couldn't understand why the hell she'd think all these nicknames were directed to her. it wasn't like i put up the nicknames with her name splashing all across them. so why the hell would she immediately think they're meant for her anywayz? whenever i see a friend's nickname that's vague and i couldn't really understand, i'd just go ask them what's up with the new nick! how can you be fucking sure unless you ask someone directly anywayz??? but you know what, now the more i think about it, i think she's just feeling guilty and afraid of being found out, like å¿è or something. otherwise why'd she instantly relate to my nicknames like that?!?? oh and besides, i totally have the rights to put up a nickname in the way i like it whenever i want! it's not like i have to run it by you first and be like "hey, is it ok if i put up a nickname like this? you won't feel like this is targeted to you and be offended would you?!?!??" JEEEEEEEEZ.  but you know what, i don't FUCKING care why the hell she did all this anymore. cuz if she's the kind of person who'd do something as low class as this, i'm actually kinda glad i found this out now instead of like another 5 yrs down the road. i was sooo mad when i got the email back from her proving she's the one, that i too, had thought about going around trashing her name on public websites. but no, i'm just not that kinda person. i will never stoop to such a low level like she did.  if anything, i'd take formal legal actions against her. and believe me, i would totally have a winning case. it's kinda ironic tho, that with my father's background and everything my family's closely linked to the legal world and has known quite a few lawyers and legal politicians both here and taiwan. i have personal friends too now in law school studying here and in taiwan as well. i asked them about this kind of situation, and they confirmed my thoughts that yes, i could totally sue her for stuff like this, cuz she was going around posing as me telling untruthful info about me! i can sue for damages!  i had actually wanted to go to the police and really wanted to sue. but you know, rite now, i just don't ever wanna see or talk to her again. she's not worthy of my time speaking to her and whatnot. some other guy said so too, that if the same thing happened to him, he would't confront the person as well, cuz it's no use, they'll just deny the whole shit. but it's not like i'm afraid to confront her or anything, i actually really want to confront her, cuz i do have the proof i need to sue her, i could get the IP address and stuff that prove she's the one, but i'll let her off easily this time. just let the whole thing go. however, if she ever pulls something like this again, believe me, i'll fucking sue her for all she's worth! hah and i guess that litigious genes really are in me all along. no wonder law courses are the ones i had the most fun in in ubc commerce.  as for that msg she posted, virgin looking for sugar daddy. so what if i'm a virgin? i'm proud to be one. most of my galpals are virgins too. even she's a virgin, yet she sounded as if being a virgin is something to be ashamed of, and it's totally not! even a hot gal like jessica simpson waited till she married nick lachey. and it's not that i'm opposed to premarital sex or anything. once i found the special guy, i'll just do it like i'm making up for all the lost times, my other virgin galpals said so too. so there really isn't anything wrong with being a virgin. the sugar daddy part is complete bullshit tho. why the hell would i need a sugar daddy when my real father is my sugar daddy? i don't really need some other stupid guy to provide me with money, i have my real father to suck the wealth from already.  and i dunno what made her think that i'd be interested in sugar daddy, cuz apparently from that msg she posted she thinks i'm a gold digger or just materialistic. hah, why'd i have to spend all the time and energy to go find some guy to dig the gold from, when i'm already too exhausted digging gold from my stupid father. so what if i have some dior/coach/fendi bags and gucci/dkny watches. so yes, i have some, but it's not like i own TONS of brand stuff. as for me loving the reality show 'the apprentice' and its theme song 'for the love of money', so i just like the song, big deal. and millions of ppl in the world watch the show and love it, so there's nothing wrong. hell, we even watched the finale together, i thought she'd know something. but well, if she judges from the fact that since i own those brand things and i love that show/song then i'd be a material girl, well, i don't really care anywayz. life's already hard enough that i don't need to think what everyone else thinks of me.  all these yrs i've known her, i had thought of her as a nice person. it's amazing how after a drastic incident that you just see the person in a totally new light. now that i think back of all the times we shared, even tho i was happy at the time with her and we did have quite some fun in these yrs, i actually feel disgusted knowing a person who'd do this. and i guess those sayings ç¥äººç¥é¢ä¸ç¥å¿ and æ¥ä¹è¦äººå¿ are true. it's quite hard to believe that someone like her, who's even 2 yrs older than me, exactly 25 in her mid-20s, would go around doing something as immature and childish as this. in fact, i really pity her. and it's actually kinda ironic, that with her being a libra, she's supposed to be someone who's peace-loving and everything! guess that's fucking wrong!!! oh i also find it funny that she blocked me off from msn ever since this whole thing happened. i haven't seen her online at all, and she's the kind who comes online pretty often, so the only explanation is that she blocked me. on icq, in her info, she claimed that someone's hacked into her account... YAH RITE... duh... just trying to make up excuses for being off. it's kinda sad actually to see that she did something like this, yet didn't have the guts to stand up and admit the whole thing, and instead just went to hide and be like a chicken!  i'm not gonna put her name on here, saying out who she is, cuz i have class and i won't stoop to such low levels. and i haven't really decided yet whether or not i'll publish this whole blog to my friends. yes, so far, no one knows about this blog, but well it's pretty new anywayz. my thoughts change pretty often, one day i'd think i'll let my friends know, the next day i'll decide not to. so i dunno yet. if i do decide to publish this, i don't really care how they judge me from all the private personal posts either. but well, that's that.  it's funny too actually, that most ppl on that cv site don't really know what sugar daddy means, so only 5 ppl have tried to add me on icq. i don't add strangers on icq/msn anywayz so if she thought she could somehow mess my life up by doing something like this, then well, she failed! this whole thing actually didn't bother me that much. so i was a bit preoccupied with this shit for a day or two, but it's not that important as the other thing that's gonna consume my mind later.  saw the korean drama 'red bean girl'.. hah, suddenly i felt like i'm that red bean girl, è«åå¶å¦å°å°±è¢«åè±å¥³æºäºä¸é... anywayz, now, after i've come blogged this down to keep it in record, i can say with confidence that this whole shit will be put behind me. i won't ever think of this again, and of course, i will never consider her as a 'friend' anymore. now, to me, she's just a stranger. and actually, i'm quite glad she's out of my life now. who'd need someone like her in their lives anywayz to be later backstabbed in! hah, so BYE! YAY! i'm actually lucky to have gotten rid of you! and as i said, i may lose a friend here, but i'll gain another one elsewhere too!

      was reading these new fashion mags the other day and came across this full-page chanel ad   urlLink    "Coco a Venise" Fine Jewelry Collection (limited edition)   GOD I WANT THAT!!! the pink ring!!! (*O*)    urlLink    "Coco a Venise" Ring (limited edition)   it's sooo pink and full of diamonds! pink sapphires, fuchsia sapphires, violet sapphires... all my fave colours!!! tho it being chanel must mean it's freakishly expensive!!! (&gt;__   urlLink    Chanel Pink Camelia Watch   while i'm at it i might as well say i want that watch! love chanel camelia watch series~ so feminine looking~ and this one being pink, is just oh so gorgeous!!!    urlLink    Dior "Fiancee du Vampire" Fine Jewelry Collection   man ever since i saw that dior diablotin ring (the rite one with the red heart and the devil tail) in japan i'm now addicted to haute couture fine jewelry. that one costs like USD $6000?! (X__X);; so i can imagine the chanel venise ring must be around that price as well. camelia watch must be like at least double the price cuz that line of watch is always over-the-top expensive...  i should really be glad that there's no dior boutique here in van. or else i'm gonna be left with no money! cuz seriously, USD $6000 for a ring like that, i may seriously consider it! so it may cost like 3-6 months of salary, but i'd really save up that money to go buy it! i think it'll really be worth it! tho i'm sure my mom'd kill me... haha. but blah, i have a weird values system anywayz.  tho too bad that chanel venise collection is all limited edition. so i'm sure it's gonna be all sold out by the time i save up money to afford luxury like that. and i still don't even know when i'd be able to save up that kinda money. just hope the dior diablotin ring will still be around by then.. in the mean time, i just keep dream dream dream dreaming on~~~ haha.. me pathetic (^O^);;

      started the day quite japanesque i must say. eating japanese-style cod roe spaghetti while watching pop japan tv. never figure out when that program's on. the only one time i've ever seen it was already like couple months back, and it was a special on x japan. today the feature artist is laruku. DOH! how come i never get to see GLAY?!?!? was talking about how laruku finally got together again last yr, did the 7-day concerts last summer, then released their long-awaited album this yr. but hey, GLAY! it's their 10th anniversary man! and they released a new album this yr too! and they're doing expo again at the end of this month! they totally deserve more attention~~~ hah or i'm just being selfish (^O^);;  had interview at 2.30pm. hmm went ok i guess, nothing much too special to worth mention about. OH! except that after i left i was outside cleaning up my bag and stuff, and this middle-aged lady went in the door. she had her keys in her hand, and hah! it's playboy keychain!!! (^O^) was suddenly really excited seeing that, cuz i felt so happy seeing someone else also owning playboy stuff~ hehe! have playboy keychain, wallet, cap, tshirt.. and really should've bought some more! man i should change my name to playboy freak (tho that may generate weird thoughts in guys.. ^O^;;) anywayz, went to kerrisdale afterwards to eat and send off yet another thank-u card. is actually the last one, i've used up the whole pack. so from now on i'll just send emails, hah. hmm then went to london drugs to buy stuff. discovered the lancome new nail polish. and was of course again tempted by the extreme pink loveliness and ended up buying it...  had originally really wanted to go out with friends to dine again or something. but then decided not to cuz i wanna do my manicure! really want to have it done before tomorrow cuz i have a makeover session in the morning and then there's a gathering. want to have my pretty nails done~~ haha crazy me (^O^) was planning on to do french manicure, but then i tried my newly bought lancome polish. it's actually quite a great polish! sooo pink and glittery!!! and has this sweet raspberry scent~ lovely! actually i like this smell more than that rosey smell of anna sui. this really was quite a great buy. $15. compared to that dior addict nail polish i got last month. that pink is soo soft so i don't really like it. and it's like $25?! man, i really shouldn't be that head over heels for dior.. it's blinding me, really... (^O^);;  and i'm once again addicted to blogging, after 3 yrs. that time i was in love channel blogging in chinese. ended that one within 1 yr. not sure how long i'll continue with this one, tho these days i'm lovin' it! maybe cuz it's sooo pink? haha! that must be it! i really like the whole look of this template~ so the pinkiness is driving me to blog! *crazy* oh! and i finally figured out today how to play around with those html codes to put on music and additional lists! (^O^) something still doesn't look quite rite tho, and i'm still trying to figure it out. it's actually driving me crazy, goddamn html codes! i've looked around on sooo many other sites for their html sources. i did everything like the others are doing. yet it still appears weird on my page!!! WHY~~~??? (&gt;____  anywayz decided to put up velvet revolver's slither first. absolutely love the song these days. whenever i hear it on radio i'd blast it out loud~ love the video too. god that lead singer looks sooo sexy! topless + low-waist shiny gold tight pants!!! the first time i saw the video my eyes were just totally glued to the screen!!! (*O*) he looks quite visual tho.. can't believe i'm finding that kinda guy sexy these days, but heh i'm always weird. but well, really love the rhythm and beats. the strong drums sound. and of course, that singer's not only got a nice package, but also great sexy voice too!!! (^O^)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   [Slither] by Velvet Revolver   When you look you see right through me Cut the rope I fell to my knees Born and broken every single time  Always keep me under finger That's the spot where you run to me  Might see some type of pleasure in my mind  Yeah, here comes the water It comes to wash away the sins of you and I This time you see   When you seek me you'll destroy me Rape my mind and smell the poppies Born and bloodied every single time   Yeah, here comes the water It comes to wash away the sins of you and I This time you see Like holy water It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry This time with me  When you look you see right through me Cut the rope I fell to my knees Born and bloodied every single time

      got email from flora this morning. totally made my day. and brought back all the sweet innocent memories in elementary. she said the guy i used to like, 517, is quite a hunk now. wow, am i glad to hear that!!! (^O^) cuz there was this rumor going around saying how after elementary the guy got fat and ugly and started wearing glasses (^O^);;; was quite disappointed actually when i first heard that. couldn't really believe that saying "one may look nice when they're young, but not so anymore once they grow up" is true, cuz the guy was sooo adorable in elementary and was not just the most popular guy in our class, but in the whole grade as tons of girls in the other classes liked him too. i know it's weird, but somehow i just feel happy knowing he's nice looking, knowing that someone as cute as before grew up to be cute as well.  but i guess the thing i want the most is to be able to meet the guy again, see how he looks now and get to know him again. i miss him, to tell the truth. i know it's quite unbelievable, that i still think about him 10 yrs after elementary. but well, maybe i've started to think more about him these days again cuz i'm watching this korean drama 'red bean girl' and in the plot, the girl got re-acquainted with her elementary crush and it's actually quite a sweet drama. but anywayz, the guy will always hold a special place in my heart no matter what. hope the same goes for him too, cuz i was the one who gave him his nickname as 517. seeing how he's still using it now, i really hope he'd remember it was me who started calling him that. oh, i wonder......

      aah and speaking of linkin park, i had really wanted to go to evanescence's concert here in van tonite!!! tho when the tickets first went on sale, cuz i didn't wanna buy it online anymore this time, i was planning on to buy it from ticketmaster outlet directly. yet by the time i had the time/chance to go there, floor seats all sold out!!! ~~(&gt;__  actually a terrible thing happened today. logged in to my first ever hotmail account that i signed up for 6 yrs ago, and discovered that i haven't logged in there over a month and so everything's erased and i had to re-activate it. (&gt;_____  have to really blame myself for this tho. being too busy and all that so i really just forgot about the whole thing. yet to tell the truth, when i realized at first that i had to re-activate the account and everything was gone, i wasn't feeling anything. and that's actually a good thing. maybe all along i've been wanting to get rid of those but i just didn't have the heart for it. now that they're all gone i won't have all the memories linger in my mind and trap me in that place anymore. see, my hopes fade away bit by bit every yr ever since 2000. summer 2001, no replies from u when i was there, i gave up. summer 2002, so much personal family issues happened at the time that made me realize you really aren't the most important thing in my life. by 2003, even tho i was there the whole time and i could go digging for the truth, once and for all, i didn't. that winter, discovered the biggest shock and realized she wasn't who she said she was all along. that was the final trigger, and i kept telling myself the whole thing's just a stupid mistake and it should be all over. and now, finally, by summer 2004, the last traces of all you two have been erased from my life. i really should be glad, shouldn't i?  all these yrs, the only reason i kept that account activated was to save those emails there, hoping that few yrs later, when i think of this whole thing, i'd still have a place to turn to, for memory. tho i was just fooling myself. all this time i could've gone back to re-live our times shared together in those emails, i never once did that. kept saying i had no time.. but well.. maybe that's just an obvious excuse i used. but seriously, ever since the end of last yr when i came upon that big shock, i've been telling myself to end this whole thing and just move on. have to say it's quite a success. i don't really think about that time anymore. and now with those old emails forever gone, i can safely say, i've put an end to that past, and is ever so ready, for a new beginning.  but still, thanx for the sweet times shared, even tho i was a big fool all along..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Music:  [Everybody's Fool] Evanescence   perfect by nature icons of self indulgence just what we all need more lies about a world that never was and never will be have you no shame don't you see me you know you've got everybody fooled  look here he comes now bow down and stare in wonder oh how we love you no flaws when you're pretending but now i know he never was and never will be you don't know how you've betrayed me and somehow you've got everybody fooled  i know the truth now i know who you are and i don't love you anymore  it never was and never will be you don't know how you've betrayed me and somehow you've got everybody fooled  it never was and never will be you're not real and you can't save me somehow now you're everybody's fool

      it's funny how i've been going to downtown for 3 days in a row. monday for interview, tuesday for cupcakes, and today went to drop off thank-u cards. normally i send in thank-u cards after interviews, but since they told me they'd make a decision sometime this week, and it takes 2 days for the cards to get there, i wasn't sure if they'll get there in time before they make a decision, so i just sent in thank-u emails yesterday morning. but then last nite when i went to bed i kept thinking.. since this is a company i'd really like to work for, i really should try harder. so i decided to just go into the office to drop them off at front desk.  yet when i went in, there's absolutely no one there at the front desk.. where's their receptionist?!? (@_@);; waited for a little while and finally somone passed by and came out to greet me. asked her to please pass the cards on, and she was like "oh~ i didn't get one too?" quite funny and weird actually, cuz why'd i write her a card when i don't even know who she is?! and the shocking thing is she knew me!!! (*O*) she's like "ur jennifer rite?" and i was soooo majorly shocked. i asked her how she knew me and she said she saw me walking in the office the other day. but wow.. she only just saw me and then she went to find out my name?! (*O*) have to say i was quite surprised and happy~ quite excited too actually. i left the office smiling all the way~~~ it totally just made my day!! hahaha (^O^)/ really hope something like that would boost my chance of working there or something!  when i arrived at downtown it was already pass 3pm and i couldn't park at the roads anymore. so i had to park at this parkade that charges minimum 30min for $3 (&gt;_   urlLink    new Prada pink heart-shaped keychain   urlLink    new Prada pink logo keychain  then went to kerrisdale to drop off sheets for dryclean and to send out mails. parents called last nite saying they gonna send money over for me to 'practice' investment stuff. whatever. but then mom asked me to go find out the current interest rates and stuff. and these guys kept asking me how i'm doing with the td bank cutie ever since i asked them for advice last time. it's funny, really, that i'm not even worried but they're all more worried than me! (^O^);; so well i decided to go to td bank. but the guy wasn't there! argh. i went 2 weeks ago around the same time, and he was there! yet today he wasn't! can't say i'm all that disappointed, maybe just a little bit really. i haven't thought of him lately cuz i've been so busy and stuff. but well.. i had really wanted to put what the guys taught me to use today yet it was all a waste. well, next time, next time..  the teller i got today, he's taiwanese too, i can tell by his last name. tho he's probably born here cuz he doesn't look so twnese. he's really funny and nice actually, sorta cute too. he kept smiling and stuff. made me think of the td bank cutie and he rarely smiles! he seems like the quiet shy type of guy so that's why it'd make me extra nervous talking to him. yet the guy today, no problem talking to him cuz he's so open and stuff. he asked me 'hey have i served u before?'.. and i was like, yah i think so. hmm.. really wasn't sure why he asked that. cuz according to what the guys taught me that could be a start-up line for conversations and stuff... it's interesting tho, but well, dunno, dunno..  went to downtown so late cuz i got a phone call from this securities company. had the phone interview at 1pm, and it's actually with 2 ppl. the girl didn't talk at all for the first 5 min and when she suddenly spoke, shocked the hell outta me... then i realized it's like a 3-way calling. were asked these 2 super interesting questions. "what are ur 2 fave animals and why". was soo surprised they asked that and i had to answer back in a timely fashion, so i ended up saying panda and cats... (^O^);; then, "who do u admire the most in the entertainment industry and why". i ended up saying linkin park... (^O^);; very interesting questions. now me gonna try asking these to other ppl and see what kinda answers i get!

       urlLink     the other day with shannon, she told me there's this little shop that sells only cupcakes and it's really good. we actually drove pass the place and so i saw it's a totally cute pink little shop! so cute! so pink! lovely~~ it's been on my mind ever since and well so these days i'm feeling a bit low i've been wanting to eat stuff.. healing food healing food~  was bored this afternoon so came online to search around, and really, i found that little shop's website! they have pix of all their cupcakes and a brief description.. and i was looking at all those yummy cupcakes and seriously, i was practically drooling~~~!!! was even telling ppl at the time in IM that i may be going down there just to buy cupcakes out of my boredom and tiredness... and guess what, i really did!!! *CRAZY*  so i drove all the way down to denman, only to buy cupcakes... LOL~ thought i might as well just buy 12 cupcakes to get the special price of $22. ended up buying 6 different flavours, 2 each to make it 12. they have a lot more flavours, but those are all super chocolatey, and i don't really like choco that much, so i didn't get any of those choco ones. 12 cupcakes, ended up only eating 3 for dinner. was actually quite full already after just 3 cupcakes. but wow, now it looks like it'll take me another 3 meals to finish all those cupcakes... guess i bought way too much out of my excitement (^O^);;  it's weird too huh.. that i ate cupcakes for dinner. told my parents that and they were like "what?!???" (^O^);; this made me remember this incident in tokyo last yr. saw in the GLAY Happy Swing fan club newsletter that there's this dessert shop called "patisserie TERU" and they have fabulous pudding, cakes, cream puffs etc. esp their pudding, it's actually called "TERU's pudding" (LOL) and they'd put a sticker on each pudding that said "TERU"~ XD well, and so being TERU love, i decided to go down to the shop one day. it's really crazy actually, cuz the place was really far in the suburban area considering i lived in tokyo metropolitan region. but i really couldn't resist the charisma of a shop called "TERU" and those desserts that i spent 1 1/2 hr just to go down there. of course, took 3 hrs back and forth, totally exhausted. ended up buying tons of cakes plus their famous pudding and cream puffs back. was eating those for dinner too. and at the time i was online as well, told my friends that, and totally surprised them... hahaha  anywayz, this cutie little pink store's cupcakes *are* really good!!! maybe it's cuz they're so pink too that i love them so much now?! and of course, i love all kinda cakes~~ heehee! (^O^)/

      *SIGH* i'm not in that much of a good mood today.  got turned down by that boutique investment banking firm which i thought i may have a big chance at cuz i was one of the final two candidates! SO CLOSE! AH! DAMN! i asked for their feedback and stuff as i really wanted to know why they didn't choose me instead. got the reply saying that i clearly am an ambitious and capable person but rite now they decided to go with someone with a bit more experience. but what's a recent univ grad supposed to do anywayz? i've had all the summer jobs too, what more experience can you expect from a new grad?!? i mean, they are obviously impressed with my background  experience, yet they still said they needed someone a bit more...  tho actually i think they just want a white person. that company, since it's boutique, is fairly small consisting no more than 20 ppl, and they are all white. i've had interviews with companies that small too but they have asian ppl and so it's not all white. to tell the truth the first time i saw the company website i was a bit surprised to see it's all white. and i remembered when i went in at the beginning of last month the person who was formerly in the position that i applied for was white too. it's just a totally white company. so i really wouldn't be that surprised if i got turned down at the very end cuz of that reason.  it's ok actually, cuz seriously, i wouldn't wanna go into a company that's all white. it'd be good if it's got at least 1 or 2 non-white ppl. but not all white. and today i definitely got to see what a diversed workplace feels like for an interview at this global logistics firm. company culture does play a big part in businesses. since this is a huge global company having branches all over the world, it just makes sense that their employees come from all kinds of different backgrounds.  when i went in for the interview i had to stay at the front desk to fill out this application form. and while i was doing so, there were ppl coming in and out casually chatting and stuff. saw this white guy discussing issues regarding the chinese language with a chinese lady, and you can just tell that he's obviously interested in the topic. i saw ppl in the office too, lots of asian ppl, not just chinese but also japanese too and etc. even their receptionist is either from europe or latin america or something cuz she said english isn't her first language and she can't even speak it well enough! which actually surprised me a lot seeing afterall she's the front desk person!! man... if someone with her english could do that job, i could totally do it as well!!! no offense to her or anything, she's actually quite nice... but still... i just felt a bit unfair. but well, the whole time i was there, i could just tell that the atmosphere was really open and friendly, and it felt really good.  well, hope there's good news from this company. actually had interview with 2 ppl. plus the time filling out the application, it took me 1 full hr there! totally didn't expect it to be like that and i drove there today, so i was really afraid my car would be towed or something cuz i only put in for 30min.. (^-^);; came home and got another call for an interview on friday. it's quite interesting. had an interview with this real estate development firm whose current project is to be van's tallest bldg located on georgia. the call i received today is for this marketing company that promotes for developers, and it's actually promoting that shangri-la bldg rite now! so they're partners! ha! oh and funny thing about this marketing firm, the owner's a white guy, yet most of the employees there are asians! only 2 other white ppl! now *that's* interesting!  oh yah, that boutique investment banking firm that i came to very close. they're quite rude actually in that they didn't even inform me of their decision! if i hadn't wrote in today to ask, would they just never tell me?!? i mean, it's one thing you don't respond to every person who applies for the job, cuz i can understand that, you must have had tons of applications so you wouldn't have the time to respond. but if i've had interviews with you, and i am one of the final candidates, it's just a common courtesy to at least tell ppl of your choice! so yah, that wasn't nice.  anywayz was a bit moody today so had the urge to eat.. really wasn't planning on to eat more for dinner this week, but aah i wasn't feeling well so i gave in. went to bbt cafe for dinner, healing food~~ *SIGH* well that concludes another day. gonna tuck in now...

       The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis!    Here is how you matched up against all the levels:  Purgatory (Repenting Believers)   Very Low   Level 1 - Limbo (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very Low   Level 2 (Lustful)   Very High   Level 3 (Gluttonous)   Very High   Level 4 (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very High   Level 5 (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low   Level 6 - The City of Dis (Heretics)   Extreme   Level 7 (Violent)   High   Level 8- the Malebolge (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High   Level 9 - Cocytus (Treacherous)   High     Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test     LOL~ amusing test! so i scored either high or very high for most levels of hell (^O^);; except for the one being wrathful/gloomy cuz yah i don't really feel depressed often or wanna kill myself or anything. and i find it interesting that just cuz i fail to believe in god and the afterlife that i'm a heretic?! so everyone who believes in a religion other than christianity / catholicism / judaism would be a heretic?!? that's just total bs! other than these, seeing how i scored 'very high' on lustful, gluttonous, and prodigal and avaricious, i guess the test is somewhat quite truthful since i really am a horny and greedy person who loves sex, fine food, and money! that's a true taurus! but anywayz, so yah, i'm a devil worshipper and i'm glad to be one! there! i said it! what what? HAH! so what if i love the fallen angel lucifer! i've always been fascinated by the story! and yah, i guess i'd rather be a sinner than a saint all along.. hehe~

      so we're half way thru the yr 2004. guess now's a good time to do some reflections on the past 6 months. am flipping thru my agenda to see what i've done so far......  have to say that for the first 3 months i've done absolutely nothing of significance. i wasn't even doing any job hunting at the time either even tho when asked by others i'd say i was, but really no i wasn't. so why wasn't i doing anything? maybe it had something to do with the fact that i had lived by myself last yr in japan so i really wanted to cherish the time i could be with my mom. that's why when i got back here in van this yr and knowing that mom would be going back to taiwan in march i just wanted to spend most of the time with her.  living by yourself does have its perks, i mean you get to stay out as late as you want without someone nagging at you. yet on the other hand it's good to have someone nagging at you too living together with a parent. so far, i've found out that being apart with mom actually makes our relationship better. whenever we talk on the phone it's just clear that we miss each other and stuff having to spend a long time saying goodbye and hanging up the phone. and once we get together again after being apart, we would just be so happy that we wouldn't fight. not that we get into fights or arguments a lot or anything, but of course you've had those sorts of things once in a long while~ yet now i think this whole experience just made us move pass that, so it's all good.  i also find this rather amusing actually, that my mom would buy me expensive stuff after being away from me. last yr after the first time i've lived on my own she agreed to let me buy the dior messenger bag (even tho it's using sugar daddy's money). and last month when she came back to van, she totally surprised me by giving me this pair of diamond earrings. she said they'd look great once i go work, since by then i'd need some nice professional stuff so i'd look mature and all that. but i mean, it's really funny cuz i haven't even found a job yet! but of course, i was more than happy to receive the gifts (^O^)  the 2nd quarter was really productive cuz i started to be really engaged in my job hunting. i've had a total of 19 interviews within this 3-month period. apparently that's like a lot within that timeframe cuz ppl got misled by the numbers of interviews i've been getting, saying that it seems like van is a city full of opportunities and it may be easy to find a job here. i'm like, no no that's totally not the case! (^-^);;  i guess the reason the 2nd quarter was soo productive was that spring/summer had come so the weather was really nice and everything that it made me just wanna get out more. i went out with friends every week either catching a flick or just casually dining out. for the last couple of months i've been watching an average of 2 movies per month. don't think that's like a lot tho. but well, it's really funny too that i've already watched 2 movies within the first 3 days for the month of july~ guess i've watched my share of films this month! haha (^-^);; well it may be really so anywayz cuz it doesn't seem like there's any more new movies that i'd like to watch for the rest of the month..   anywayz, that concludes what i've done so far in the first half of this yr. my agenda shows that the first quarter was like mostly blank while the 2nd quarter was so full. now looking onwards to the latter half of the yr, just hoping it'll end up as productive as this past quarter, and that the agenda be written so fully too! (^O^)/ all in all, even tho the yr started off a bit slow for me seeing i've done nothing much for the first quarter, have to say it's got better, and i'm sure it'll definitely be better still ahead!!!

      hanged out with shannon today, haven't got together with her in a month! took her to my fave place to chill these days at "chicco dall oriente cafe" in downtown. absolutely love everything there. tried their anmitsu today. can't resist the combination of green tea ice cream + red bean paste + rice ball (shiratama) oishii--! (^O^)  urlLink    ã¯ãªã¼ã ããã¿ã¤  also shared the green tea strawberry cake with shannon~ yummy cake~ again, just can't turn down anything green tea!!! maybe i should change my nick to maccha freak?! LOL~~ but still, after having tried out everything in that lovely cafe, i have to say the absolute best thing there is the green tea parfait!   urlLink    æ¹è¶ã¹ãã­ããªã¼ã±ã¼ã­  after dessert, went to watch spidey~ didn't watch the first film cuz well, i didn't like spiderman.. he's not as attractive/sexy as batman or superman. and well, tobey maguire isn't cute either. so i really didn't have the desire to watch the first film even tho it was such a huge blockbuster. tho this second one i've been fascinated with the storyline watching the trailers and stuff, so i had really wanted to see it! and it really is a pretty good film! so funny and everything~ let's see, maybe i just love that phrase "even tho sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most in order to get what we want..." so much that it made me wanna go see the film?! haha.. but well, story's definitely getting interesting! now i can't wait to see the third film in 2007 where harry turns evil~~ wicked!!! now *that* guy, james franco, is cute! haha~  went to "jang mo jib" korean cuisine for dinner. totally packed considering after all this was a saturday night! really yummy food~ was sooo full and we couldn't even finish all we had ordered! am still very full now 5+ hrs after the dinner. been eating too much for dinners this past two days i'll have to cut down on dinner the rest of the week! eat too much for dinner is not good! can't sleep well either! aah! but well can't resist the yum food! yay! haha~~  all in all, a pretty fun day! it's always great catching up with old friends and stuff (^O^) and saw shannon's new puppy coffee~~~ such a damn cute little thing!!! absolutely love it! tho i still wouldn't wanna raise a pet on my own having to take care of its shit and all.. (^-^);; but well, that's that! now off to dreamland! whee~~!!!

      blah blah blah. went to the gathering. aaaargh i'm never gonna go to their bible studies ever again!!! auntie wu said before oh it's gonna be like informal chit-chat, it's not gonna be so seriously focused on bible and stuff, yet it still was!!! (&gt;____   the only interesting thing was that a cute guy came! woohoo! (^O^) he has nice arms.. haha.. and tall and kinda buff. ah he has nice voice too! and wow he has like the brightest smile i've ever seen! but we sat too far so didn't get into talking. hopefully he'll go to next week's bbq as well then i can get to meet him~ apparently there're gonna be other fellowships going to the bbq too so yay! hopei get to see more ppl! lalala~~~    hmm it's always so hard for me to pick out clothes to wear to their gathering tho. can't wear these devil/skull tshirts.. well once i did and eric was like "what's that?" and i'm like "hmm.. the death" and he was shocked and went like "why would u wear that?" (^O^);;; it's funny actually that u can scare guys by telling them u like skull! hah! this weird guy somehow associated me liking the skull to me gonna kill myself!! what kinda logic is that??? jeeez. and then he changed into saying "oh skulls are cool~ i like them too~" but jeeez, u don't have to say that just to please me!!! duh...  can't wear these playboy tshirts either. and then these other super lovers tshirts with all the big heart logos, i feel those are kinda weird for the event too, and well i'm sure i'd get teased again for those slogans like "love is the message"... but hmm actually now that i think about it it may be suitable to wear that, them being all "jesus loves all~ god loves u no matter what~" and blah blah *LOL*    anywayz so i ended up wearing today this super lovers tshirt with the slogan "rock'n roll disco" on it. during the discussion when it's my turn to share my thoughts, eric went like "ok~ now the rock'n roll girl~" haha so funny. i always find it fascinating how asian guys find it so hard to believe that girls would like rock music. remembered once at school before we went to this hk guy friend's home to do a project. he already knew i like rock but when i was looking thru his cd collection, he was like "red hot chilli peppers~ u like them?" i'm like, yah i know about them. and he went like "wow~ u *really* like rock!" (^O^);;    and then another time we were supposed to do this test to get to know each team member better. u have to guess what the other's fave type of music is. no one guessed rock, so when i revealed the answer, all of them were sooo shocked!!! and the funniest thing was this cbc guy kept going like "WOW~" till even after the class!! he was like "what kinda rock u like? hmm name a band" i said OLP at the time and he was already *that* shocked. he would've acted double shocked then if i'd told him i like LP!!! *LOL*    but then so yah, why'd asian guys find it soo shocking to know girls like rock? when i went to those LP concerts in japan half of the ppl there were girls! and they were these normal looking girls too, just the ones you'd see everyday on the streets~ some were even quite girly! the david usher shows here u'd see a lot of asian girls too! so what's the big deal anywayz? it's like a big mystery to me~    and the funniest thing i've heard these days is that apparently i'm white! *LOL* just becuz i like rock music! sooo funny. thought it was very interesting too that guys would think like that. aah tho i dunno, these days i get mistaken a lot as either being cbc who doesn't know chinese or being japanese. i go to these chinese stores/restaurants, and ppl would just speak to me in english! and then was surprised when i started talking in chinese.. (*_*);;; i find it very weird too tho cuz usually when i'm with my mom then ppl could figure out from her that i'm chinese. they said they'd still have doubts and be unsure about it, but usually ppl could figure out more easily.    it's really fascinating to me why ppl'd think i'm japanese. i dunno if that's supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing, to be mistaken as being another nationality. when i'm in taiwan ppl'd always think i'm japanese. i'd say no, i'm taiwanese. and they'd be like "really? oh mixed?" and i'd still be like no, both my parents are taiwanese! and then they'd go like "but ur chinese sounds kinda weird... ooh u live abroad don't u?" i was sooo shocked ppl think my chinese sounds weird! how can it be? i speak it like everyday! aaaah it's just so weird.    and so when i was in japan ppl there would all think i'm japanese. and then they'd get sooo shocked i turn out to be a foreigner! *LOL* it actually feels quite nice to shock ppl like that~ really fun! hehe! somehow in van here these days i'd get mistaken as tourists too tho. go into shops to buy stuff and ppl would ask me "so, how u liking vancouver?" and it feels soo weird!! (*_*);;    how could ppl tell the nationality from the looks anywayz? i can never guess ppl's nationality! at least for asians... quite confusing to distinguish between chinese, japanese, and korean. and then within chinese u'd still have to distinguish from taiwan, hk, and mainland! aaah! anywayz i dun really know what i'm blogging about now for this post... (^O^);;

      it just so happens that both the interviews today were at richmond. the 11am one was with this supposedly leading north american chemical distributor company (have absolutely no idea what kinda industry that is...) that i got from hunt personnel. they really suck. so hard to get set up by them these days. it's good i finally got another one set up tho, it's just that i'm quite pissed at them. but oh, the position is like this office assistant in the mailroom that only requires min 6-month office experience, so that's really really entry-level, yet the pay is like $28K! (*O*) the downtown ones i'm looking for these days only go up till like $25K and most don't go that high and yet they require like 1-2 yrs experience. so wow i was really surprised by the high pay! but yah for that kinda money i'd be willing to drive down to richmond to work! haha.. (^O^);;    had lunch at earls with sami. yay~ (^-^) then went to buy cd-rw discs. i'm really not that tech-advanced. i used to just store stuff on floppy discs, then later on i put them all on hard drive. is actually the first time i'll be storing files on a cd-rw disc! (^O^);; flora emailed back saying her pc got virus before and all the reunion pix got erased so she's asking me to send her mine copies. quite frankly i can't even remember now where the hell i'm keeping all the old pix tho? knew it's somewhere on the notebook, but i really need to re-organize all my digital photo albums. there're all these sticker photos i took in japan last yr that i've been wanting to scan ever since i got back! *LOL* it's already been like a freaking half yr and i still haven't scanned them just cuz i'm lazy like that. and well, i already threw the old stupid scanner into another room so now i really need to clean up my desk area to move it back just for scanning this one last time. after this i'm gonna throw it away for good. it's sooo old and slow and stupid... bleh~    the other interview was at 2.30pm. this one's such a big contrast from the morning one just cuz this one's intern position and it's 4-month no pay. it's really ok tho, i don't care about the money that much anywayz, as long as i get to do something it's all good. the interview went well. the guy said he thinks i'd be much more suited for other positions tho cuz this one is for marketing. it's really interesting. first time i've heard something like that. "u'd be better fitted for managing and operating the business, rather than building up the business (sales/marketing)"... that's how he thought of me and my experience/background. i do appreciate ppl's feedbacks, cuz i seriously am quite confused haha. but well, seems like i won't get this position but he said he'll pass it on for the other one that'll open up later. at interviews, sometimes u can just tell if there's a good vibe or not ne? i could feel it was going nice today. and it's really nice of him to advise me on what i'd be better suited in doing. so yah, i hope he's like the panalpina lady who'll pass my resume on to other dept later~    went back to sami's place to change outfit. wasn't gonna wear the stupid suit while i go out to play! and it was sooo goddamn freaking hot today!!! and aaaaaah!!! after i changed and we came down to my car to drive, i realized my car key wasn't even in my pocket and noticed that it's been dangling outside the car door all along!!! i never even locked the goddamn car when i went up to sami's apartment!!! (O____O);;;;; was sooo shocked. and good thing my car was still there when i came down... thank god... *whew*    decided to go watch the movie "before sunset" tho it's only showing at 5th avenue cinema. i really have to thank eric for telling me about this movie! cuz it's sooo good!!! (^O^) seriously, if he hadn't mentioned about it last weekend, i wouldn't have paid attention to the movie review anywayz when i was reading the weekend newspapers those days! i have to remember to thank him tomorrow when i see him~ haha~    it's funny really, how i've been watching these romantic movies lately. it's messing up my mind somehow tho, being extra boy crazy (^O^);; but wow, this film and "the notebook" that i saw few weeks ago, are like the best love films i've seen in yrs!!! esp this one with all the sex jokes it's just hilarious!!! (^O^) ppl were all laughing their heads off!!! hahaha!!! too bad there's no actual sex scenes tho *LOL* but wow,now i really wanna go watch the first movie "before sunrise"~ (*O*) yah, the reason this movie stucked to my mind after erictalked about it was because he said it's somekinda 24-hr love story and this couple met but had to part ways very shortly and stuff. heheh.   fell in love with ethan hawke's character. but oh come on, there'd be no guy like that in reality who just as a one nite stand remembers and loves the girl so much it drove him into writing this novel about their one nite together!!! *sigh* movies really are a great way to escape reality huh... maybe that's why i love watching movies so much? hah.oh and i lovehow they're just walking around inthe city and chatting. to me that's a great date! (^O^) so yah, it'sreally sweet watching them walk around and catch up for the entire film~   drove back to richmond and went walking around in richmond centre. hah. went karaoke. i can't believe i haven't gone to karaoke in like almost 1 yr! (*_*);; and i can't even remember when's the last time i sang in van?!? been soo outta touch with the karaoke here i dun even know where's good to go sing now anymore. the beloved mike in metrotown closed down and i was sooo bummed. now where the hell am i supposed to go sing GLAY's songs while watching their videos?!?? (~&gt;_   came home just pass 11pm. and the most horrible thing happened. i put my key into the back door to unlock it, and realized it's not locked at all!!! and then i vaguely remembered i probably didn't even lock the back door when i went out this morning at like 10am!!! HOLY!!! (O________O);;;;;; so the whole day 12hrs i was out, it was just unlocked like that!!! GOD, was sooooo shocked i could be ditzy like that and i got quite scared what if ppl broke in, i went to check every single room and the basement... good thing everything's normal. WOW. am quite dumbfounded.    can't really believe i'd be sooo freaking careless like that. let's see, first there's yesterday when i forgot to turn on the alarm clock. then earlier today when i forgot to lock the car. and now i realized my whole house wasn't even locked when i was out!!! i have to say, it must have something to do with last nite, the fact that i didn't get to sleep well. hmm said my mind was like spinning around in the morning. so yah, it's sooo bad. am gonna get major lectured atwhen i told mom this... (---___---);;; and hmm i probably will get sooo laughed at when i tell ppl. tho i'm sooo thankful that van's security's so well. or maybe i'm just lucky for today. jess lives 2 blocks down the street and said that their neighbour got broken into for like 3 times in broad daylight!!!   have to say that other than these ditzy episodes that i created myself stupidly, it was an absolutely wonderful day~ lalala~ got online at 12am and wow it's now 2am... stupid blogging. damn i write way too long. but sometimes i just can't help it. haha (^-^);; it's good tho, hopefully by sleeping late tonite since i was already sooo tired and everything i'll fall asleep faster and end up having a good sleep!!! hah!

      let's see. i've been having trouble falling asleep for the past week or so and last nite was the only nite so far i've had a great deep sleep. actually woke up at 7am. thought that's still early enough cuz i set the alarm clock to 7.30am, so i went back to sleep. thought it's perfectly ok cuz the clock would wake me up in half an hr. god was i wrong... next thing i know, i woke up and it's 8.30am!!! was sooo shocked and distinctively remembered the alarm didn't go off at all! then i realized vaguely that it's probably cuz i didn't set the goddamn clock last nite... (^O^);;;    interview at 10.30 and i was supposed to leave at 9.30 for bus. i knew these days cuz the weather's so nice and everything the bus always takes extra long time passing thru kits beach. but i was sooo rushed i left later than i had intended. and holy.. there were tons of little kids going on field trips and stuff filling up the bus. i was sooo freaking relieved i arrived at the office like 3-5min just before the time.    was hanging around at the front desk of rbc investments and i saw this colourful little sheet on it, and hah! it's an invitation! apparently that devil bldg park place is celebrating its 20th bday next wed!!! (^O^) that's so cute! haha! am planning on to drop by just to look around~ hehee~ oooh and there's this orca outside the bldg too. tho it's this weird eagle thing. now why would they put an eagle there?? a devil would be much more suitable!!! XD seriously! i'd love to see a devil orca!!! (^O^) tho i guess these rigid religious ppl wouldn't like seeing the devil figure when they're walking on the streets huh.. haha    interview was ok. i suppose?! i thought the guy had sounded kinda mean on the phone the previous day but he turned out to be quite nice and was smiling and stuff. so that's good. the position is more like a telemarketing one and is only for the summer. tho i figure u know, since it's rbc, it's all good~ and he said he'd set up a script too! so that's great! anywayz have to wait till next mon to hear back.    on the way back home on bus, there's another group of little kids going on field trip to the kits beach (@_@);; and god, the kids these days *are* really mean!!! 2 poor little girls threw up on the bus and these little guys were all going like "eeewwww she puked!!!" but seriously, what's the big deal anywayz? there were sooo many of u little noisy freaks on the bus and the air was so stuffy and everything even i felt like i'm running outta my breath (&gt;___   there's a cute guy with a guitar coming on the bus near kits beach tho. and immediately after he got on the hippie old dude sitting beside me started talking with the guitar guy. they got into chats about the guitar and rock music and stuff. very interesting. haha. the guitar guy has this dreadlock hair but still, kinda cute.. tho i dunno, even tho he looks young he has these terrible crow's feet around his eyes, is kinda freaky (O_O);;;    came home to rest for a little while. ate lunch. went out for walks. this 3hr was actually my only resting time for the whole day. had interview at this real estate development firm in richmond at 3.30pm. and aaah it turned out to be.. well i don't really knowhow to comment on it. besides that little weird new mainland pharmaceutical company i had an interview with a short while ago, this was the only other one that i've interviewed with so far that i knew nothing about before the interview since i couldn't find any info cuz they are all new!    went into the office. and waaa there were these 4 middle-aged twn men. was immediately quite surprised. the interview was weird too. they would speak to me in mandarin but asked for me to answer back in english. that's so weird! i mean i've had companies before who'd say mandarin to u and yah u reply that back to them! all still in same language! anywayz, it was pretty obvious anywayz that the 4 of them aren't good in english so they just want someone who knows english in the company. i don't like companies like that.. seems like they're just using u and stuff. i mean sure i'd love to utilize my linguistic abilities, but it's not like that.    ended up staying in that office longer than i had anticipated cuz they gave me these tasks to perform. come up with a letter for late rent and do an excel spreadsheet. i was there for what, 40min?! and aaah, the whole time i was there doing the stuff, they'd just chat there and act like these typical twn middle-aged men saying stuff in taiwanese that kinda creeped me out. remembered i had a chat with sami few weeks ago and she was like she wouldn't like it as much being the only non-white person in the company, but she wouldn't mindbeing the only girl. i was thinking about that while i was at the office, and i was like hell... there'd be no way i'd wanna work in a company like this being with 4 middle-aged weird dudes... i may consider it if they are nice young guys tho. *LOL*    anywayz because the interview went on way longer than i had expected,it messed up my schedules for the late afternoon.did remember to go to yaohan to grab tons of pocari sweat drinks, so that's good. had togo buy fruits too cuz i'm outta stuff to eat. and i noticed that the gas price at some stations already went up so ireally wanted to fill it upwhile it's still cheap! ended up coming back at home at exactly 5.30pmwhich was also the time i was supposed to leave the house to go do aerobics!!! (&gt;___   aerobics was really good tho.hah.. even tho i felt like i'm about to faint any moment there being sooo hot from all the movements and the sweating.but it's all good. tho because i had absolutely no freaking time to rest at all for what, 4hrs straight, i was so extra goddamn tired. but i really wanna keep up the aerobics so i had planned to go do it again on fri morning too buti got callbacks for interviews tomorrow so i guess rite now i'll just keep aerobics to 2days a week.and see how it goesand if i can really keep this up.. hah.can get quite lazy at times. blah.    had ashortresting period reading the newspapers but i was also trying to call back auntie wu.she left a msg in the afternoon sounding so urgent and everything. yet i had been trying to call back for nearly 2 hrs and the line's busy! jeeez. when i finally called in ended up talking forlonger than i expected. it's so weird.there's this girl i thoughtis eric's gf cuz they seem really close like a couple and stuff, yet eric denies it. i remembered few weeks ago at the gathering when we were all sitting together on the same couch and he started talking about him being single... it was getting weird why hekeptstressing that point and finally the guy beside me asked him why hewanna get that point clear across. and somehow there was mentions aboutme and it's all weird and awkward. i still dunno what the whole thing's about (@_@)    but well, soi was really curious how come the girl never comes to their gatherings, even for some fun events. andauntiestarted saying weird thingslike that's what she's concerned about.. having different faith and something about the girl wouldn't convert to christianity.i waslike sooo shocked in my mind thinking wow, shewants her son to be witha christian (or at least someone willing to convert to that)?!?? (@__@);;; christian ppl can be soo up-tight sometimes it really freaks me out. i would never expect someone i be with to believe in the same things i believe in!!! everyone's entitled totheir own freedom ofbeliefs!!! jeeeez. anywayz it was really stupid of me to have promised her fewdays ago that i'd be going to their bible study onsat nite.those aresooo freaking boring i hope i don't end up falling asleep again there this time. something about the theme this week being "be content about the things u already have,don't stress over those things u want"... man... and ur supposed to share ur thoughts on that. OH GOD. (---___---);;;i'm actually kinda amazed at myself. how come i canjust say noto some ppl so easilyat times and yet some other times it's so hard to say no...    auntie wu wanted to meet vivian so i had to call her up to ask her if she wanna go to thegatheringon sat. shedoesn't wanna go.. hah i had guessed that already.if i hadn't promised auntie i'd go cuz i thought at the time it's held at her house and it's gonna beall casual and everything and plus she kept asking me (!!!), i would've thought of some smart excuse to turn her down!!! aaah!!! (&gt;__   then mom called. told her about all the things and of course it freakedher out i went to some 4 middle-aged menoffice all by myself. waslectured at... saying blah blah blah i have to be careful and stuff.parents actuallyaccompanykids to interviews these days in twnu know... etc etc.oh come on, i didn't really think it'd be that much of a big deal... and i just didn't think of it that way at all! until ppl clued me in. i guess i really am still somewhat innocent/naive at times, even tho i'd like to believe i'm notlike that at all anymore.    it's really funny in a way, just the day i'm extra tired and busy i get all these phone calls. and ended up being on the phone for over 1hr.is almost 11pm. and yet i still haven't done my research on these 2 companies that i have interviews with tomorrow. was gonna try sleeping earlier today too like last nite at 12am. seems not possible for today tho. doh. oh well me do research now~~~ aaaaaaaaah what a busy day... tho it's nice to be busy sometimes~ it takes ur mind off things and it just feels good running around doing stuff~ (^O^) lalala~~~

      stayed at home today sending out applications and stuff. cuz i've been going out for two days in a roll that i haven't sent a single application out this week at all!!! am so bad (^-^);; let's see, sent out 9 applications today, got 3 callbacks! yay! the last time i went crazy and sent 10 resumes out in a single day i got 3 callbacks too. guess that's just the ratio huh.. 3 outta 9/10. haha. well so i've got 2 interviews tomorrow! and the funny thing is the morning one with rbc dominion securities is at that 666 evil bldg park place that sami and i were just talking about yesterday!!! hahaha!!! XD another funny thing about that one is the interviewer, his name is phil knight!!! isn't that the same name as the founder of nike?!? wow. but the guy doesn't sound that nice tho, not his voice but his way of talking. felt kinda mean or something i dunno. and he's got british accent?! hmm anywayz i have to do research later too after me finish blogging.  oh yah and i looked back at my own blog, and i realized that yah, i did associate guys with nice voice as nice looking myself too! haha. man. guess that's just human nature to do those kinda things? had interviews before with these cute guys and when they called i already guessed they'd be nice looking.. aah blah. should really try not to do these things tho. hmm and i really don't wanna mislead ppl by my stupid voice. have been thinking more and more about those pix things. and yah i guess it really isn't that much of a big deal anywayz for them to see me. i don't fucking care if one day i'm walking on the streets someone'd recognize me. hmm and besides, flora was asking me to send her our elementary reunion pix. so yah, i've decided that i really will go organize my pix around hopefully before the end of this month. have to go to staples to buy these cd-roms so i can save pix up and organize them tho~  aaaah and before i forget again, have to go buy pokari before the hoobastank concert!!! and also cuz me going to aerobics these days, really have been sweating too much that i need the drink! buy pokari buy pokari!!! (*_*) was supposed to buy it for linkin park concert before as well but i forgot! so yah this is major. hmm anywayz am gonna try going to bed before 12am today! have been having a hard time falling asleep for like almost 2 weeks now! damn! last nite i ended up falling asleep at like what, 2am?! and i got woke up this morning at 7.30 by noisy garbage trucks!!! aaargh. well that's all for today~  heehee watched the simple life earlier. paris and nicole got this handle name as the pink panther cuz their truck is pink. thought that's indeed a very cute and hot name! hahaha! and i love any stuff with pink leopard print!!! let's see, i bought this pair of knee-high stockings that look like the ones in the pic few weeks ago at holt renfrew. tho i haven't thought of the occasion i could wear the stockings to so i haven't even wore them once! (^O^);; anywayz will try soon one of these days~ lalala~   urlLink    Pink Leopard Print~~ XD

      went to lunch with sami today~ she was in the kerrisdale area so we got together. went to 'ginger and garlic', for me first time. and well it's an ok place i guess. tho these days i'm finding that i don't like chinese food anymore, it's really too oily.. aargh. but haha it was fun~ eating and chatting for like 1.5hr (^O^) oh, and i brought cheques to deposit today. i really could've done it later on in the days, cuz it's not important, but well, i purposely wanted to show sami the td bank cutie i like, so i brought the cheques along with me when i left. tho too bad, he wasn't there!!!!! AAAAAH~~~ (&gt;____  let's see, was talking about that park place bldg in downtown that has the number 666 as address. we both find it very fascinating, hehe. and then told her i saw a car plate that's like 'HHH' the other day, and i'm like, i want a car plate that's like '666 HHH'!!! *LOL* sooo funny~ cuz that'd be like what, 'evil/horny pervert' XD but seriously, i'd really like a car plate like that! it'd be way cool!!! or else me gonna get one that's like '517 JEN' hehe, my fave number (my bday) and my nick! (^O^) otherwise me want a customized one.. that either mentions GLAY, or pink, or peach! wahaha!!! *crazy*  went to aerobics later on in the afternoon. waaaaaa soooooo tired. haven't had an intense exercise in a long time. aaaai. am gonna keep this up and go in for the rest of the week. not that i'm trying to be on a diet particularly or anything. but really, life in van is too relaxing and i've gained weight back again since i returned. i miss the way i looked in japan last yr at this time. even tho i was still somewhat chubby, i looked a lot fitter while i was there from all the walking around.. hah..

(^O^)  and then just when i was searching about the ticket info on that one, accidentally found out that 'Madame Butterfly' is gonna be in town as well!!! YAY!!!

      well the past few days had been kinda chilly actually, but today was sooo hot. aaah. tho i guess it still can't compare to the weather over in asia. can't believe tokyo's already got a record-breaking high temp this early in july at around 35 degrees. HOLY. am i glad last yr it was cool summer there or else i'd have been fried. hah.   after interview around noon, came home to eat lunch while watching soaps. haven't watched days and passions in a while, and hmm the plots are getting kinda interesting! think i'll keep tuning in for the rest of this week if i've got the time. went out for a walk around late afternoon tho. tried walking different routes today by going for the hills and stuff so i could get a better workout.  it really is too relaxing here in van. everywhere u go u just drive and u hardly get a chance to walk and stuff. guess one of the major advantages living in tokyo last yr was that i had to walk all the time. probably walked for at least 2 hrs every single day! plus i lived on meguro hills and the school was on shibuya cherry blossom hill.. so i had to keep walking up and down on these hills. no wonder i lost weight there even tho i had all the yummy food.   so yah, these days with the beautiful summer here, i'm feeling like i really should go out more to enjoy the great outdoors. so me gonna go for more walks these days! ah and i think i'll start up aerobics again. gonna go for it tomorrow! yay! lalala~~~   the weekend van sun had a report on the hells angels and put up a pic of their logo so i saw it for the first time. i mean, even tho i knew about the infamous biker gang, i didn't know they have a logo and it looks like that! cuz wow, that's such a cool logo!!! winged death head!!! love it~ (^O^) i love their name too, Hell's Angels.. but hah, i'm just weird. i'm interested in everything that has to do with lucifer the fallen angel. heehee~~~ XD   urlLink    Hells Angels (winged Death Head logo)

         urlLink     urlLink What Name Should You Have?   have to say it's quite accurate! i'm always being called too childish, tho i really dunno why ppl would think that way about me. hmm i guess i do appear to be childish on the outside, but inside it's like half innocent and half dark. darkness may be taking over more and more as i'm becoming older tho, hah. as for being funny and sociable, that really depends on who i'm with. if i'm with my close friends and ppl who know me well, then yah i'm all that. but if i'm with ppl i just met or i don't like or couldn't care less about, they would never find me as sociable. hah. i'm pretty subjective when it comes to meeting and getting to know ppl. but anywayz that's just me! aaah tho i don't really like that name krista.. hmm still sticking to jennifer even tho it's such a common name (^O^);;

      chilled at home today mostly. reading newspapers. watching tv. hah, watched that film 'fatal attraction' for the first time today! i knew what it was about before, but i just never got the chance to actually see the film. have to say it's a really good movie!! had me on the edge of my seat for the whole time.. quite scared and excited. i like michael douglas~ he's a really great actor and he used to look quite handsome when he's younger. like his film 'wall street' as well, which i just saw few weeks ago. maybe i just like his characters in both those films. corporate man or lawyer, wearing suits and trench coats.. (*O*) and quite dark mysterious looking too~ can't resist bad boys, heehee.  watched another old movie at nite. indiana jones and the raiders of the lost ark. can't believe the film was made the yr i was born! so it's already 23 yrs old! (*_*);; but well i like indiana jones series~ so just watched it to kill time~ nothing else interesting on tv anywayz. not feeling that well today and so stayed in cuz well.. pms. bleh.  watched the korean drama 'red bean girl' too~ nice drama, and i'm starting to really like it! can't wait to see what happens~ haha~ anywayz watched sooo many hrs of tv today. and well, quite a typical sunday for me. just relaxing and rest in~ lalala~ enjoying my simple life here in van~ (^-^)

      went to richmond centre sears for makeover session with dior at 11am. was there few weeks ago buying DiorKiss and saw the posters saying there'll be dior stylists coming in yesterday and today doing makeovers, so i booked an appointment. the stylist guy looks like that evil guy in "the mummy", the bald one who's the mommy but looks sooo sexy when he's not in mummy form (^O^);; seriously, i like that guy in the movie more so than i like the main character brandon fraser (well actually i don't really like him at all). tho only the stylist guy isn't as sexy as the guy in the movie cuz he's fat (^O^);; but well he's really nice.   took 1hr to do makeover. and he easily recognized me as a pink freak like everyone else does. so i ended up having everything pink for eyes and lips. hmm and in the end, i bought moisturizer and toner, as well as that pink/purple eye shadow set cuz it looks so nice.. aaaiyai. overspent money again on cosmetics (--__--);; am really bad. oops so now with the cosmetics around $130 and i bought that pink JLo bag the other day at $100 after tax.. total $230?! think i'm supposed to spend $300-500 now on visa?! after spending about $1500 on visa alone for 2 months straight before (while being unemployed --__--;;).. now i get a limit.   anywayz, funny thing was just 10min into my makeover when i've only had foundation put on, someone greeted me and it was eric and his mom. totally surprised me cuz i didn't think i'd meet ppl down there. kinda embarassing too being seen doing makeover.. well not exactly embarassing, just funny i guess. and it's really funny too cuz i would see him tonite anywayz at potluck. and he was saying 'wow u look so nice~' being all polite or i dunno what else, when i really haven't done anything to my face other than foundation! (^-^);;   went to vivian's house to order pizza so we'd go to potluck together around 7.30pm. she asked me whether or not i like opera, and hey! found another opera fan!!! sooo happy~~~ (^O^) in early may 'la traviata' was showing and i didn't think friends i know would be into that kinda thing, so i didn't even ask anyone. only to realize later that sami likes operas too. it kinda figures cuz we're both taurus and appreciate the finer things in life, something like opera. anywayz, so i missed seeing 'la traviata', sigh, only if i had asked her. but well, now i know another person who likes opera! YAY! next time there's nice opera in town i can ask either one of them~~~ can't wait!!!   potluck was ok. nothing too special. was really funny that everyone got excited by the new pizza hut 4-for-all pizza we ordered tho. haha. and of course bumped into eric again there, asking me to show him the make-up i've done. tho before going there i had already wiped off my pink eye shadow. i didn't wanna show up there with all the make-up cuz ppl are gonna think i'm so weird to dress up for that event, which i really wasn't trying to do. the makeover sessions are yesterday and today, seeing how yesterday i had an interview, there's only today left. but so yah, he's like "hey show me ur face!... wow u look really nice!" and i'm like but i've already taken off the eye shadow... it's just basic make-up now with foundation. (^O^);; had the other eric say the same thing too. man guys really can't notice how differently you've done ur face huh..   something about eric said after seeing me this morning his mom commented me as being pretty. but i'm like, that's what elders always say to youngsters.. they're not gonna come up to you and say "gosh ur ugly..", rite?! (^O^);; but anywayz i appreciate the comment in my heart~ haha. he said that afterwards he and his mom came down to look for me again wanting to see how i'm done after makeover only to find me already gone. hmm oh well.. it's nothing serious really..   and aah, had sort of a weird chat with him too. started talking about honeymoon cuz he's getting married in a month. he doesn't seem to take honeymoon seriously and i was a bit surprised.. and he kept saying "no, really, what's honeymoon anywayz?" and i'm like.. ur supposed to spend a whole month together and stuff.. and he's like "to do what?!?" i'm like "uuh.. sex? ur supposed to just keep having sex thus creating a sweet relationship (honey) for an entire month (moon) and that's how you get the word 'honeymoon'..." (^O^);; felt quite weird being the one explaining to a soon-to-be-married guy who's 10 yrs older than me btw in his 30's what a honeymoon's supposed to be, telling him it's a period of time when u keep having sex. and the weirder thing is, he doesn't even seem quite excited about it either!!! he's like "that's it?!? just sex?" (*__*);; i thought guys would be a lot more excited than that and be like "wow! a whole month of hot sex!!" anywayz he's a weird but funny nice guy.   have to say that after going to that church fellowship for so many times now, hah enough times to be able to vote for their next chairman, i'm still not familiar with most of them except eric and his sis. most of the times they are the only ones i talk to. i find it funny/ironic actually, that the other eric who introduced me to the group doesn't talk to me as often, or didn't at least try to be nice about it and make a better effort for making me feel more welcomed there by talking to me more and stuff, after all, he's the one who brought me there! so well, that's probably why i got a bit pissed before and didn't go there for a while, other than the fact that they had boring activities. but bleh, who needs him anywayz, i can go find my own fun in the group~

      bbq was quite fun. was held at this HUGE mansion in shaughnessy. sooo big and pretty~~~ was just in awe the whole time i was there, haha~ the bbq itself was nothing too special tho. cuz still ended up talking to the ones u already know! damn! that cute cbc guy i saw last week who has the brightest smile i've ever seen actually wanna be a chef. so he was the one doing all the cooking and stuff. at the end of the dinner he had to clean up and stuff too so he couldn't join us for the ice breaker game! so damn! i still didn't get to talk to him! (&gt;___  saw this other cute young guy tho. sorta timid looking but looks sooo cute when he smiles~ has 2 dimples!!! (*O*) very cute~ but i think he's way too young. *LOL* the guy's probably not even 20!!! damn i'm becoming a pedophile.. first there's daniel radcliffe and now this?! haha crazy weird me~   was very funny cuz i bumped into an old ubc friend maria. actually i didn't even know her well before while we were at school. i just knew her cuz she's the sister of this cute guy whom debby had a crush on at the time cuz he looks like takizawa hideaki. vaguely remembered that i've seen her at some ta events and it turned out i was rite! she said i look familiar too haha. so we got into talking and catching up. yay~ so it was quite good cuz vivian couldn't come today. she had really wanted to come to the bbq but suddenly got pms last nite so had to cancel this morning. oh well there's always next time~   the funny thing was of course, everyone kept asking me about the huge bruise i got on my upper rite arm!!!everyone seemed sooo shocked and would ask me what happened.. like i got into fighting?!?? *LOL* i'd tell them i got it at this concert i went to on thurs nite. and of course, everyone looked very confused as to how u could get a bruise from a concert!!! hahaha~ it's really not a big deal anywayz cuz i've got bruises before from concerts too. so i'm quite used to it already~ but for ppl who know nothing about rock concerts, it's actually getting kinda annoying having to keep explaining to them that this kinda stuff happens...   eric was the only one who knows about rock concerts seeing how cbc he is, haha. he was like wow u went to the mosh pits? and then he's like how come u didn't get guys to go with u to protect u? yah i dunno. that morning i was talking to johnny and i told him i'm going to a concert and he's like "wuu~~ with a guy?!?" u all know i'm single! why'd u just assume that i'm going with a guy anywayz?! so weird. but well, quite frankly, i dunno guys who're that big to protect me anywayz. all the guys i know are just same height as me! it has to be someone tall and strong enough to protect me in the crazy mosh pits!!! (&gt;___  and somehow i'm known in that group for being a frequent movie goer. they'd always ask me about which new movies i've seen and stuff. so funny~ and then somewhere along the line i dunno, we got into talking about clubbing. and i'm like 'no i don't go clubbing anymore for a long time'. and eric just said 'oh no, she would~'. now where the hell did that come from?!? (@__@);;; do i even seem like the type who loves clubbing?!?? that's the weirdest thing.. haha~   so the bbq ended way earlier than i had expected. i got home at 9.30pm. but then i figured since tomorrow i'll be going down to seattle i better just come back to rest cuz i'll have to wake up at around 8am the next day! so lalala~ blog away all the missing stuff these past few days~ (^O^)

(&gt;______  and the funny thing was i called them back yesterday to confirm the appointment since i made it a month ago i wasn't too sure! and yet i still forgot to go in today!!!  damn... am way too busy these days going out to play that i'm becoming forgetful... especially when last nite i didn't come home till 1.30am and i went to sleep at nearly 3am.  woke up this morning at 11am. and totally just thought that today i have nothing to do except to fool around by coming online to blog for the events that happened in the past 2 days and to wait for tonite's bbq!!!  didn't even bother to look at the schedule book!!! cuz i wrote in big letters that i have dentist appointment!!! and i didn't get clued in till they called me back and i realized that aaah i was supposed to go in!!!  and now i have to wait till sept cuz the doctor's fully booked... jeeeez. aaah anywayz wait till mom comes on friday and see if i go to another dentist~

       urlLink     urlLink    *LOL* huge-ass bruise i got on my upper right arm from the previous night's Hoobastank concert. was fucking crazy i tell ya!   this morning when i woke up i realized all the muscles and joints in my body are sore as fucking hell. really just wanna lie there on the bed and not move~~~ once i got up and looked into the mirror tho, noticed that i've got a big bruise on my upper rite arm!!! HAHAHAHAHAH~!!! (^O^)v dunno why, but i felt really happy i've got a bruise~~~ felt like it's some sorta proof that i've gone to the concert. is actually sorta like a trophy in a way. i have weird logic. *GRIN* but it *really* hurts... (^O^);;; well that's the price u pay for having fun and going crazy! hehee~ tho i can just see now, i'm gonna get sooo teased by ppl cuz they'll all get shocked seeing the huge-ass bruise... *LOL*  went out to kerrisdale again today. haha. had to go to td bank to withdraw usd for going down to seattle on sunday. funny that i've been going there twice this week already! i just went there on tues! (^O^);; well but today when i went in the guy wasn't there. but just when i was lining up, the guy came in!!! he went out to get lunch!!! and he went upstairs to eat... DOH!!! and to think i dressed up nice today!!! damn! (&gt;___  went to bean bros cafe to keep writing my summer greeting cards. there's this guy i noticed for all the 3 times i've been there this week!!! he's always there! soo funny! he sat outside tho and i sat rite on the counter facing outside, so i was behind him. hehe. he's kinda cute. hmm the italian cafe rite across from bean bros is really nice too, but i guess i still prefer bean bros just becuz they've got these counter seats. i love sitting there facing outside and watching the ppl walk by~ and yah, could see cuties too if there are any *LOL*  went to oakridge around 5.30pm. had to go do exchange at aritzia for this top i got the other day at downtown that's too big. and aaah! i ended up buying stuff again!!! (&gt;___  she took me to this new izakaya in yaletown called "shiru-bay". just opened for 2 months or something and it's the same owner as "guu". but it's quite different from guu tho! cuz WOW, it's such a cool place!!! (*O*) it's sooo stylish and trendy!!! it's also got very good food, and very cute waiters!!! yah, that last part was the most important one. *LOL*  there's a japanese waiter there, tho i think he's also born here cuz his english is really good, who's sooo cute!!! (*O*) and he's got the chin ring!!! just like how cutie chester used to look like!!! now how cool is that?!?? (^O^) spiky hair~ i think he's same height as me but eeh that's ok as long as he's cute haha~ he's sooo nice tho, kept smiling all the time~ the whole time i was there i'm thinking in my mind like "damn, i'm definitely gonna be bringing my friends into the restaurant to eat a lot in the upcoming weeks!!!" so i can see him!!! hahahaha!!!  we later realized after going to the ladies room that the restaurant's hiring. they put up this japanese ad and the one major criteria is that u have to keep smiling all the time! no wonder that cute waiter was smiling always. yah i'm told that u can often get misled by waiters cuz they act that way to everyone...  well, so alyson was saying how she may consider going to work at the place! and i'm like why would u do that when u already have a job being a jpn tutor. and she's like "so u get to meet new ppl!!!" and i'm sooo clued in. hahaha. i guess that'd really be a good way to get to know the cute waiter huh... (^O^) and so now i'm considering the option too myself! tho i dunno.. waitressing is such a tiring job. and me being spoiled rotten, i dunno how to carry those plates around anywayz!! and it being izakaya would mean that it won't close until pass midnite.. i dunno if i wanna work till that late.. (@__@);; man i really am picky... haha  i think i'm actually one of those éå¥½ã type of person. not that i drink a lot or like to get wasted, but i love cocktails, kahlua, champagne, and japanese plum wine!!! (^O^) had the peach cocktail tonite. in the menu it described it as å¹¸ãã®ãé (^O^) yay! hope it'll bring me more more happiness!!! hehe!!! they have green tea cocktail too tho!!! was sooo surprised, happy kinda surprised!!! cuz i'm definitely gonna try that one next time i go there seeing how i'm an absolute maccha freak!!! hahaha~  went walking around in yaletown after dinner at about 9pm. the funniest thing happened. while we were waiting at the stop lights these 2 white guys who were crossing the street and coming towards us started talking to us! actually i only noticed 1 guy cuz the other guy was really really short!!! the tall guy was sooo cute!!! (^O^) while he was coming towards us he was all smiling and everything, so we of course smiled back seeing how the ppl here are just always friendly on the streets smiling at each other (^O^) thought it'd only be like that, but then he started to chat with us!  he asked us if we went to the indy's. i'm like no.. and ooh yah it's the indy's weekend! it goes on till sunday rite? and he's like yah, u should go check it out! haha.. and then he said something about we looking cute haha. so funny~ man.. dressing up differently really gets u somewhere huh.. alyson was saying how this has never happened to her before that some guy would just come up to talk to u on the streets. so hah! me really gonna change my style and dress nicer!!! crazy little me. *LOL*  tho damn.. apparently there's a lot of cuties down at the indy's. i'm definitely going next yr!!! (&gt;__  oh yah and during dinner at izakaya i told her about the td bank cutie and how my heart would race up whenever i got him and i would end up mumbling things so he couldn't hear me clearly and would always have to ask again and i'd have to repeat it... and she was laughing SOOO hard, i'm like (--___--);;; ã²ã©ããï½ç¬ããªãã§ï¼ god.. so embarassing.. and she's even like, "u know, if my throat isn't hurting and my voice is still all good, i would seriously just laugh out sooo loud that what i'm doing now would seem like nothing!!!" *sigh* i always get laughed/teased for my boy craziness.. (^O^);;;  went to urban fare too. first time for both me and alyson~ haha and it's such a cool place!!! i like the salads they have in there~ am thinking from now on i'll go there to do grocery shopping sometimes! seems crazy tho, i know, to go to yaletown to buy food while i live down in kerrisdale... (^O^);; but haha i should seriously start going to yaletown more often!!! i saw sooo many cute guys there the whole nite!!! and some of the prettiest boys i've ever seen!!! oh maybe it has something to do with the fact that it was a fri nite too, but really, tons of hot guys my eyes were like starry all the time!!! alyson was quite amazed that i was checking out guys sooo fast tho... hahah.  anywayz afterwards went to alyson's condo to play. haha~ she's sooo technology advanced!!! she has this mic and net phone.. and she showed me how to use 3/4-way calling. so fun. she kept telling me to go install it to talk to ppl online ever since i was in japan. but hmm i really dunno who to do that with and i'm really not that good with those too complicated stuff so i didn't go install the net phone. well, so there's one cbc guy who just got back from uk and we were all talking together. and alyson was saying how these days she likes how these cbc guys talk, it's really cute. and i'm like yah yah!!! i totally know what she's talking about!!! (^O^) so alyson and the guy wanna get together on sunday to welcome the guy back but also to send alyson off and i'm also invited seeing how i was there at the time. tho too bad.. me going down to seattle that day! otherwise i'd really like to meet him! alyson said he's really nice but not cute, but it's ok, it'd just be nice to make a new friend anywayz~ and the way the guy talks seemed funny~  then i started to play with her webcam~ haha! sooo fun!!! now i know why ppl go crazy over taking their own pix using webcams!!! at the time i was taking pix tho, alyson's highschool friend in taiwan was also online so we were talking on net phones. she could hear me taking pix cuz there'd be sounds. and she's like i'm sooo slow in taking pix. apparently it's totally different from the way alyson did it cuz she'd just keep taking tons of photos really fast! haha~ alyson was like "haha finally someone narcissist like me!" but really, no i'm not! i just thought that it's fun to try out cuz i've never seen webcams before~ and i haven't really taken any pix this yr so far, so i thought it'd be cool to take some that nite, seeing how dressed up i was anywayz. it wasn't until after i took about 10 pix i finally realized i had to take the pic of the bruise!!! hahaha!!! can't believe i hadn't thought of that earlier and had like no idea what kinda pix to take just smiling stupidly at the webcam while all along there's the perfect thing to take pix of! (^O^)  stayed till pass 1am. haha. sooo fun. should definitely do this more often!!! (^O^) anywayz another lovely day!!! so will the next 2 days be for bbq and seattle!!! sooo happy~~~ this is turning out to be an awesome summer indeed!!! (^O^) and mom's coming next fri!!! YAY!!!

      I'm not a perfect person  There're many things I wish I didn't do  But I continue learning  I never meant to do those things to you  And so I have to say before I go  That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me  To change who I used to be  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you  It's something I must live with everyday  And all the pain I put you through  I wish that I could take it all away  And be the one who catches all your tears  That's why I need you to hear   I've found a resaon for me  To change who I used to be  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I'm not a perfect person  I never meant to do those things to you  And so I have to say before I go  That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me  To change who I used to be  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I've found a reason to show  A side of me you didn't know  A reason for all that I do  And the reason is you     the song that made hoobastank famous. it's really a sweet song and i love the lyrics. the video's awesome too. soo funny and creative. got such a huge twist. haha. so anywayz, during the live, they played this song in the middle of their set. when they finished the song, doug said something like  "so i've been told that this is the song that's most often used at weddings in 2004. well, so if that song's the one ppl get married to, then this next song is one..."  and i thought he's gonna say  "ppl have sex to"  *LOL* he said  "...ppl get divorced to"  hahahahaha~~~ so i guessed wrong. eeh close enough~ (^O^);;; my dirty little mind... *GRIN*

      let's see.. went to kerrisdale bean bros cafe in the afternoon to write summer greeting cards. and realized aaaaah~ i'm forgetting japanese!!! (&gt;_____  tho i guess i still could communicate alright. at least with yumiko. and she's surprised i know all these weird slangs. *LOL* was supposed to meet with her at 6pm and i did get to downtown at the time. but the goddamn parking lot i had wanted to park in ate my money!!! then i had to frantically search for another parking lot to park.. ended up being a cheaper place too except that it was kinda crappy and scary and smelly..  while yumiko and i were walking along robson and stopping in front of milestone's to check out their menu and deciding where to eat, bumped into eric! was totally surprised when he called out to me! and to think that morning i just sent his mom off to the airport and i just bumped into him like that! hah!  these days i'm always bumping into ppl in downtown tho. when i went shopping the previous day i bumped into a commerce classmate too, and she got all chubby and i couldn't really recognize her! (*O*) one day a few weeks ago when i was in downtown doing interviews i bumped into 3 ubc ppl.. amazing. u always tend to think that van is so small and it should be easy to bump into ppl, yet that's not always true. sometimes it can be big enough that u never get to bump into the ones u really wanna bump into!  anywayz eric was walking around there after work and so he thanked me for dropping his mom off at the airport that morning. told him we were gonna go to a concert and he's like wow~ but he doesn't know anything about them, yah i had figured that'd be the case. few yrs ago i bumped into him at the savage garden concert tho. hah. well, finally decided to eat at the downtown tropika. was telling yumiko about south-east asian cuisine and she's all like happy~ so we went there. yumiko was all surprised that it's soo trendy and 'high class' looking. haha (^O^)  thought the doors open at 8pm and since the floor area doesn't fill up that fast at commodore anywayz i decided we'll just get there rite at 8pm. turned out were we wrong... the line-ups were SOOO long it went on till 2 blocks away!!! by the time we got in, it already filled up a bit on the floor! aaah! we were still standing really close to the stage like at 5-6 rows but not close enough.. wuu. commodore was all dark inside that nite, so weird. but then again i haven't gone there in almost 3 yrs ever since the david usher concert! (*__*);; asked yumiko how the default concert in may was like and she said it wasn't dark like that since the beginning too! so yah it was so weird! cuz then i couldn't really see ppl's faces! i had really wanna go there to find cute guys!!! hahah...  at dinner while we were discussing about the band yumiko said the lead singer doug is half japanese! sooo shocked!!! so yumiko said hoobastank is quite famous in japan. and yah! there were quite a lot of japanese there that nite! there's an asian guy, i think most likely japanese, standing beside me and is about the same height as me, who looks quite cute! and it was sooo funny cuz we were head bopping and moving our bodies to the rhythm in the same way... (^O^);; tho damn i still didn't talk to him. hah oh well.  i actually know only 2 hoobastank songs yet the reason i decided to go to their concert was, yah first to find cuties, two cuz i haven't gone to concerts in 5 months so i really wanna go get crazy, and three cuz of that lead singer! when i first saw them at the linkin park concert i thought he looks like edward norton. yet when the video for 'the reason' came out i thought he looks like john cusack! and i really like john cusack!!! haha.. but no now i don't really think they look alike. anywayz he's cute~ and has got a great voice~ and now that i know he's half japanese, i may just like him more~ (^O^) haha! mixed-blood half asian rockers are cool~~~  i thought there's only 1 opening band, at least that's what the radio and webpage said for all the days before! yet it turned out there were 2! both opening bands and i had no idea what's their names were awesome!!! the 1st one had a lot of these melodic songs and i love their rhythms! i did notice their bassist look like ryan gosling!!! hahaha. and it's ryan gosling from the notebook cuz he has all the beard!!! so he's not really pretty, but i dunno why i kept looking at him... (^O^);;;  the 2nd opening band was apparently more famous tho cuz some ppl could recognize their songs. when they were about to play a slow song the lead singer said something like  "it's hard to play a slow song when ur not having sex"  and this girl rite in front of me yelled out  "yah!!! i want sex!!!"  *LOL* so true, so true... HAHAHAHAH~~~ (^O^) and near the end of their set that lead singer dived into the crowd!!! XD~~~ was actually rite beside me! i moved away cuz i was scared.. haha. but it was totally surprising! i thought he had just wanted to step onto the fence to be really close to the audience to sing or something, yet he dived down!!! first time ever to experience that!!! the band dived in!!! was sooo fucking cool!!! hahahahaha~~~ band diving in is really fun!!! especially if ur rite near the stage!!! wahahaha!!! oh yah and in all the craziness i did manage to touch the guy, but eeeeh, it's all sweat... (^O^);;;;;;  so yah, doors opened at 8pm. 2 opening bands each performed 30min yet took another 30min to set up the stage, so by the time hoobastank came on it was 11pm, and went on for 1hr to finish just pass midnite. but OMG... what a fucking crazy live!!! this was definitely BY FAR the scariest / craziest live i've ever been to!!! cuz there were lots of mosh pits and lots of surfers!!! (&gt;____  hooba started with the song 'out of control' yah, one of the only 2 songs i know. haha. and it's really fitting too to start the live with that song~ cuz everyone just really went totally outta control!!! yah, and let's see, when hooba came on i was in the 2nd row centre rite in front of the mic stand. but that first 5 min for the first two songs was probably the TOUGHEST time ever in my life!!! TONS of ppl pushing from both sides and from the back... couldn't really stand still from all the pushing so u could only flow with the crowd. very scary. had to be so careful cuz there were sooo many times i thought i was gonna fall down!!!!!  by the time the 2nd song finished i lost contact with yumiko and got pushed to a bit back. (&gt;____  one guy noticed me and started talking to me. he's like a mountain~~~ seriously!!! he's probably like 180/190+!!! and it was quite dark at the time so i felt like he's just mounting over me... i had to raise my head so high to look at him. i did see that he's quite good looking tho~ and muscular~ XD it's really funny, cuz i really dunno why he'd talk to me while hooba's still playing at the time!!! so it's really noisy and hard to hear!!! i mean if ur gonna talk to someone, usually u'd wait till the song's finished isn't it?! (^O^);;; but well, so he asked for my name and we shook hands. i think i asked for his name too but i can't remember what it is now... (^O^);;; and the funniest thing was he said  "don't worry, i will protect u"  *LOL* that did feel really sweet at the time, and i was like "oh ok thanx~" but then i think he's one of those mosh pit guys cuz he's sorta in the circle... well so he really wasn't standing close to me to "protect" me anywayz! i mean if ur gonna protect someone like u said u would, shouldn't u be with the person close by?!?? so i thought that's really funny.  another song went by and he came up to ask me again to see if i was still doing ok. and i'm like yah i'm good. and he said something like "ooh yah... u like that don't u..." (?!???) i think he meant it as something like i like these mosh pits and like going wild and crazy?!??? but well, that's the last i saw of him. i moved away from that crowd and he disappeared. *LOL* so what the hell was the whole "ooh i will protect u" shit?!???? jeeeeez. (^O^);;;;;;; u know, i wasn't really expecting some guy to protect me... but anywayz it's all fun~ hahaha. thought the whole thing's just really funny and interesting tho. (^O^)  so that guy was no help. but this other cap dude was really really nice. when i first noticed him i was behind him. and his muscles were.. hmm kinda like these wrestling guys so kinda scary. then somehow i could move up so then we were standing next to each other before hooba opened. that's when we were still rite in front of the stage. during the waiting times these guys kept pushing from the sideways and this cap dude helped us all by pushing them back. and he still had a smile on while he was doing all that! i mean it's really uncomfortable and everything yet during the whole time he would keep his smile!!! i thought that's really nice of him. and i noticed that he looks quite nice too~  somehow both of us got pushed backwards. and i ended up standing in front of him i think.. and he protected me!!! (*O*) see, now that's a nice guy! cuz even tho he didn't say out loud "oh i will protect u" his gestures showed!!! compared to that other guy who said so yet didn't do it!!! hahah.. (^O^);;; and doug threw down a water bottle and the guy caught it!!! and he gave it to me!!!!!!!! (^O^) i was sooo thankful at the time cuz i really needed some water!!! hmm tho now that i think about it i was kinda bad cuz i didn't offer him to drink?!? all the other guys were looking at me for the water so i gave them the bottle after i took a sip. and i dunno, if the cap guy had wanted to drink, he could've drank first then gave me ne? so i guess maybe he didn't wanna drink at the time?! tho that's hard to believe too seeing how fucking crazy the concert was and everyone was dehydrated from all the sweat and heat... ah anywayz i dunno.  the stupid funny thing was i kept the water bottle cap. *LOL* how crazy am i?!?? cuz i thought well afterall that was the water bottle doug threw down..... even tho i didn't technically catch it myself, the cap guy handed it to me rite after he caught it~ it's really dumb cuz i mean, it's just a plain aquafina water bottle cap!!! (^O^);;;;; but well u know, it reminded me that the whole thing wasn't a dream and it really happened ne? hahah. tho it's too bad doug didn't take a sip first. i mean, some other singers would drink first then throw the bottle down ne? now *that* would've been much much nicer!!! cuz then it'd be like indirect kissing... XD~~~ HAHAHAHAH!!!  doug started out wearing this long-sleeve shirt.. as he sang the buttons started coming off one by one.. and till the middle of the set he just took the whole shirt off. XD~~~ so he was topless and covered in sweat... god, my conclusion now is that the image of sweaty topless men (if muscular enough) is the best sight in the world!!! seriously, i was just drooling there and eyes fixed on his body~ fucking sexy!!! XD~~~ his muscles are just sooo firm!!! aah, i think tonite i'll just fall asleep with the image of his body in my mind... *GRIN*   urlLink     urlLink    sweaty topless Doug~ XD   they closed the set with the song 'crawling in the dark'. seriously, how come their song names are sooo similar to the ones by linkin park?!?? there's 'crawling' vs 'crawling in the dark'. 'runaway' vs 'running away'.. and some other ones i can't remember now. but one thing was confusing tho. they didn't do encore!!! at the end of the main set doug did say "so this is gonna be the last song..." but i thought that's what all bands say anywayz and there'd still be an encore. but there really wasn't! when the song ended and they went off the stage everyone really just started to leave!!! so how come there was no encore?!?? yumiko and i were totally dehydrated and fucking tired we just wanted to get back immediately to the car to get those pocari sweat to drink. otherwise we were saying at dinner originally that we'd gonna go wait for the band at the back door for autographs!!! wuu... no energy... *sigh* maybe next time...  yumiko was sooo lucky tho. she somehow got to be in the front row rite up against the fence!!! (&gt;____ _____  i was also sooo stupid to wear that new top to the concert!!! i had really wanted to wear the pink skull tshirt like i did to the linkin park concerts last yr, but then i vaguely remembered that the one time i went to commodore before a lot of girls there were wearing these sexy nice girly tops! so then i decided to dress up like that too! (&gt;____  sooo shocking. can't believe i stood for 4hrs straight again!!! am freaking tired. i think my neck's gonna break in half... it hurts like fucking hell from my head-bopping too much. anywayz even tho it was quite scary when u were in the moment, it's all really fun afterwards when u think about it~ i love losing control and going all hyper and crazy once in a while~ it does u good, really! am actually just contradicted. i mean on one hand it was quite hard to really enjoy the concert being in the mosh pits and everything. u have to constantly be on guard for nearby surfers so u won't get kicked in the head and stuff (it hurts like fucking hell to be kicked in the head!!! i think i got kicked a few times!!! wuu. &gt;____  and i totally love 99.3 the fox now!!! they're just fucking awesome!!! yumiko and i were both saying how these days the radio station we listen to just stay fixed on the fox channel. *grin* they really know how to please the crowd. cuz let's see, during the waiting times for all the set up, they played that famous nirvana debut song.. eeh i can't remember the title.. youth something. "here we are now, entertain us!!!" (^O^) and everyone of course instantly recognized the song and would all sing along!!! the same thing happened again and again for the muse's 'our time is running out'... some jet song... and red hot chilli peppers 'californiacation'. immediately after the concert, fox put on 'i love rock'n roll'. i dunno whose song that is, rolling stones?!? but well everyone went all crazy and was all singing along to it again!!! hahaha!!! 99.3 the fox ROCKS!!! and I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL~~~ WHOOHOO~~~ and Hoobastank is quite good!!! they totally rock!!! me gonna go buy their albums now definitely!!! hahaha!!!  i *SO* love going to rock concerts. when ur standing there close to the stage and u hear the loud drum sounds, i just feel sooo alive. those loud drum beatings against ur heart beats... nothing more satisfying than that. i really feel like it's a proof of living, and i guess that's why i love going to concerts. when ur in the crowd and u feel the whole audience melt into one being, all just enjoying and loving the music, and everyone losing control and going hyper crazy, it's just fucking fun. ã­ãã¯ã³ã³ãµã¼ãã«è¡ãã®ãå¤§å¥½ãï¼çãã¦ããè¨¼ãªãã ãããand it's funny too that because the live itself is sooo aggressive it's actually like a battle of life/death!!! ççæ¯åç¶æ­·äºä¸å ´çæ­»å¤§æ°ä¸æ¨£èªª... when it all ends i'd be like "aaah~ i'm sooo glad i'm still alive!!!" *LOL* çãã¦ãã¦ããã£ãï¼ï¼ï¼

      so far this week i have no interviews. don't think i will get any anywayz cuz this week there's not that many openings i saw and so i didn't send out that many applications. am just gonna slack away this week, like i spent the entire day today in downtown shopping~ haha. but it's fair i think?! cuz ever since mid-may i've been having interviews every week ranging from 2-5 per week! so yah i think i deserve a little break~ haha~  mom called earlier at midnite. couldn't tell her i went shopping today and ended up buying 5 tops for like $250 in total... (^O^);; *sigh* i'll just be like before, let her find out on her own when she gets the visa bills later on... ah ha... am such a coward.  anywayz, told her i went to the steps aerobics again yesterday cuz alyson postponed the dinner plans. and aaah! even she's getting suspicious now as to why i'm suddenly all interested in working out after slacking off for sooo long!!! (&gt;____  but seriously, i don't really know why either? maybe subconsciously i really do have reasons. but well so far the only possible reason i can come up with is cuz i'm liking someone now?! but it's sooo weird tho. when i had the stupid crush on the td bank guy for months before i still kept slacking off! yet now i'm all like aerobics crazy and wanting to change my style to wear more girly clothes?!?? it doesn't really make sense! aaaah i dunno. is just all so complicated and weird.  äººã¯æ¬å½ã«è¦ç¥ãã¬äººã§ãå¥½ãããã«ãªãããªâ¦â¦ ãããã ãã§ã®äº¤éã§ãâ¦â¦ ã¾ã æ°ã«ãªãã£ã¦ããç¶æã«ãªã£ã¦ãªãã¦ãã å°ãªãã¨ããç¢ºãã«æ°ã«ããããªâ¦â¦ ã§ãã©ããããâ¦â¦ãããªããããªããï¼ ã®ã£ã¼ ã¤ãã¤ã¼ ãã¸ã¤ãã¤ãï½ï¼ èª°ãå©ãã¦ã§ï½ï¼ï¼ï¼¿ï¼ï¼

      it's unbelievable. went to downtown and originally had only wanted to do window shopping.. but ended up really buying stuff and overspent again. (^O^);; and i walked for 4 hrs straight until i finally went to rest and sit down!!! (*O*) wow.. i don't think even when i was in japan or taiwan i had walked for that long before i took a seat to rest?!? man.. was just really crazy today.   ended up buying like 5 tops. ah ha... am so bad. what's even worse is that æ¬å½ã«æã«è½ã¡ã¡ãã£ãã¨æããããï½ã¤ãã¤ï¼cuz i started to buy these girly cute shirts! doh! other than the 2 tna tops i bought for workout so they're sporty, the other three tops all just look nice and feminine for the summer. man.. these days i buy a lot from zara and banana republic. but i'm really getting tired of all my tees. even tho they're still cute with all the cool slogans, they're all the same style! so yah, i think i really need some changes in my closet.   saw in holt renfrew this new juicy couture bag. it's sooo cute!!! looks like the one britney spears has in that new everytime vdo!!! (*O*) sooo pink and fluffy!!! but aaah it's expensive. (&gt;__  i'm always seeing these costly nice stuff... damn. mommy and auntie chie are always saying how the things i like all turn out to be expensive stuff. well i can't help it.. how would i know they all end up being expensive (*__*);; but this is becoming like a bad habit.. gonna be outta control soon. aaaah. i need help.   after walking around for 4 hrs and my feet were killing me, finally arrived at chicco. had the green tea parfait for dinner~ hehe. who the hell has parfait for dinner anywayz?! (^O^);; aah and since i was sooo freaking tired from all the walking around and shopping i didn't have the energy to write my summer greeting cards.. (&gt;__   urlLink     æ¹è¶ããã§ï½å¤§å¥½ãï¼ï¼â§â½â¦ï¼   well so i was reading this jpn fashion mag there. there's a report on all these male actors. in the list there's daniel radcliffe. and it goes like, æ³åä»¥ä¸ã«æé·ãæ©ããä¸åèº«ãªãã¦ããéä¸è§å½¢ããããã¾ããããã®ããªã¼ã»ããã¿åã(Mr. Harry Potter is sure growing up faster than public expectation. Isn't his upper body already becoming like this reversed triangular shape?) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA~~~!!!!!!! XD totally just bursted into laughter when i saw that!!! cuz it sooo confirmed my views!!! kept telling ppl how daniel's chest is becoming broader and stuff after seeing the new movie and everyone thought i was weird that i put soo much focus on his body!!! but finally! someone else agreed with me!!! daniel radcliffe is becoming more and more drool-worthy!!! god i'm such a pedophile... (^O^);;;   aah~ also saw in the mag this ad for new sony cyber-shot digicams. these new ones are sooo cool!!! u get to turn the lense around to take ur own pix!!! aargh hard to describe in words, it's just sooo cool!!! how come the cyber-shot d-cams in japan are nicer looking?! i dropped by future shop today wanting to check out their prices for the nikon coolpix, only to find out they don't carry nikon.. but i looked at their sony ones and they're all bulky!   man.. now i can't decide which d-cam i want! *sigh* tho i guess i'll still stick to the nikon coolpix one cuz i only need a basic d-cam with like 2-3 megapix.. the new sony ones have up to 5 mega.. that's too much for a beginner like me i think.. and besides, me not in japan now to buy it anywayz.. too much trouble to ask ppl to buy for me too..   i dunno why i want a d-cam now? just cuz it looks nice. haha. crazy weird me. i was thinking of just getting a mobile camera cellphone like the one i had in japan. those cells are really quite convenient to use! u get to call ppl but u also get to use it as camera too! but then now that i think about it, once i take pix with the cell i always have to email them back to PC too so it costs money. then i might as well just get a separate d-cam?!   but omg, now it looks like i have sooo many things i wanna buy! (&gt;____  new cell - something way less than $300?! since now i won't be needing the mobile camera function i wanna keep the cost down.. just a pretty colour flip phone.  nikon coolpix - $300  new contact lenses - $200. think i just ordered these the other day.. not sure how much in total yet tho.  new hair-do - $100. really need to trim my super long heavy hair!!! aaargh!!! and i wanna get red highlights too~ not sure about perm or not tho.  skin-care products - damn i think i ran out of some things again! and to think i just had the dior makeover few weeks ago and already end up buying way more than i had wanted that time! (&gt;o  hmm still not sure about the juicy couture pink fluffy bag.. but the small one alone already costs $350 or something.. even more than the coach bag. doh.  think i'm supposed to not buy anything expensive before the 25th. cuz the plane tix mom and i bought was put into this month and cost thousands already. so i'm supposed to wait until august to buy things. but damn.. i spent over the limit again~ aaaaaaah. i really shouldn't go out to do shopping on my own. i always end up buying stuff or seeing stuff that i want!!! (&gt;___  anywayz, came home rite at 9pm just in time for the simple life. haha. and wow, it's amazing really, cuz i finally watched her sex tapes this morning! (^O^);; i know it's all the big fuss last yr, but i never got the chance to see it.. well i didn't know where i could see it either. finally today i got the links from fwd email. haha. and i was sooo shocked cuz it's sooo explicit!!! (O____O);;; the only one time i've seen a porn was the one on that twn female politician, but that's really nothing compared to the hilton tapes!!! haha. was just really shocked~   well, it was such a gorgeous day today~ i didn't think it's that hot at first cuz there's the breeze and everything. yet later on it became so hot i thought i was in asia!!! apparently it's gonna get hotter for the next few days~ yay~ nice sunny day on sat for bbq~~~

      dinner plan with alyson is postponed till friday. it's good, cuz then i could go to do aerobics. can't do it this thurs cuz of the concert tho, so that kinda sux. these days i really love doing the steps aerobics! hah! can totally see now why rie got sooo into it before (^-^)  let's see.. so i *did* go to td bank today. and i *did* end up getting him!!! (*O*) was so funny. cuz the old man in front of me got him, and i was thinking in my mind "oh damn.. now i won't get him!" but it turned out that old guy was soo quick they finished in like 1 min or 2! and then it's my turn with the guy! haha! man i guess that praying did help huh... (^O^);;;  but i still didn't talk to the guy (^O^);;; one thing was cuz it was kinda busy there today and i looked around at other ppl, no one would talk to the tellers!!! so how am i supposed to talk to him?!?? aaah. and well the other thing that's really the reason why i didn't bother to chat with him, was cuz i realized today that i'm not into the guy anymore. when i got him today my heart rate didn't race up!!! *LOL* cuz seriously, for the past couple of months when i got him, my heart would pound sooo fast~~~ i guess it's kinda good tho that i got over him. cuz it's a really stupid crush anywayz.  but it's funny, just when i realized i don't like him anymore i finally figured out his name!!! (^O^);;; it's a really special name i must say.. hardly ever see guys with that name! and i realized today he's quite skinny (*_*) but well, he's still really nice looking~  and OMG... i think he really might be the guy who called me before!!! (&gt;_____ ____  and it's crazy. even tho my heart rate didn't race up anymore when i saw him today, i still ended up mumbling stuff!!! DAMN!!! (&gt;___  went to bean bros cafe afterwards to chill for like 2 hrs... writing summer greeting cards. and also took the time to think why i got over my crush now. *sigh* is probably cuz i got interested in someone else. damn... cuz that's not a good thing either. it's complicated. aaaaaargh.  kept looking out at the passers-by while i was there. damn how come there's no cute guys in kerrisdale?!?? cuz there were tons of hot girls walking around, yet in the 2 hrs i was there, there were only what, like 3 nice guys?!?? man.. it's no fun~ haha (^O^);;  went to check out that big camera shop today. last week i passed by there and saw they put this nikon coolpix digicam on the display, and wow it looks sooo cute!!! (*O*) so i went in to ask about it today~ haha~ i don't really know how to use these high-tech gadgets. haven't wanted to buy a digicam (until now) cuz i think they're quite complicated to use.. and well, i'm not the type of person who loves taking pix all the time. am not that photogenic to tell the truth. haha. but aah, that digicam is sooo cute now i'm like i want it sooo much!!! i have to do some thinking tho...  so i spent the whole afternoon in kerrisdale. took me 10 yrs to realize how much i love the neighbourhood. seriously, these days i would go for walks in the area for like 1 hr after lunch! and i feel so thankful that i live on the mackenzie heights cuz there's all these uphills/downhills i can walk on. and then i get to see the views from the hills too~ yay! feel soo nice watching the views on a bright sunny day~  love the kerrisdale commercial area too. dunno how to describe the atmosphere there. it's definitely not like downtown. yet it feels really great there too. lovin' kerrisdale~ XD really! i think it's better than shaughnessy! that area is soo dull and boring with all the old mansions. and they don't have a commercial area like we do here. it's lively here~ hehe~ anywayz it's been a lovely day~ lalala~ (^O^)

      these days since i really wanna try talking to the cute td bank guy i keep asking ppl for advice. hehe. am really gonna try it out tomorrow IF the guy's there and i get him~~ *pray* i just have to figure out first if he's single or not, or else it's gonna be so embarassing to hit on him when he already has a gf...  aaah~ and i finally thought of a good way to get to know the guy!!! i should go make friends with the other tellers there!!! (^O^) hahaha~~~ am sooo stupid. why didn't i think of this few weeks ago?!?? seriously, i just thought of this like on friday! the idea just suddenly crossed my mind and it seemed to be like quite a good one! tho i'm told that if i go make friends with the girls there, and the girls like the guy too and wanna date him, they'd just lie to me, and then that's no good. (@_@);;; so i should go make friends with the other guys there then. damn.. and just the other day i got that twn guy who was soo friendly and everything!!! damn i didn't think of this last week or else i'd definitely try to talk to him more!!! (&gt;___  guys all say it's a lot easier for girls to pick them up. jeez.. supposedly the "directness" = "desperateness" in all of that makes it hot. (@_@);;; but i hardly know any girls who'd go put the first moves on the guys they like! it's really hard!!! (&gt;___  is really funny tho. apparently i'm very weird cuz i'd talk to strangers if they come talk to me *LOL* debby's sis is in tokyo now studying for the summer and it's her first time there, so i was telling her the other day to remember to tell her sis not to talk to strangers on the roads. cuz apparently those guys are pimps who are either asking u to go do porn films or to set u up with sugar daddy like æ´äº¤. only just found that out few months ago and i was sooo freaking shocked!!! (O_______O);;;; cuz i thought it was just normal pick up! they started by asking u "how old are u..." "are u a student or are u working..." and i thought that's like pretty normal! some guy told me the other day that those are really obvious clues tho. cuz apparently in japn porns they show a lot of that.... now how the hell was i supposed to know that?!??  but it's really funny tho. i don't think i even seem like the type of girls who'd do those things! so why the hell would they come talk to me in the first place anywayz?!?? haha. found the whole thing just very funny. is actually an interesting experience! i only talked back to those guys cuz i thought it's a good way to practice my japanese... *LOL* and i guess i was quite young at the time so i was a lot braver and didn't care. last yr when i went i got scared a lot easier and wouldn't respond to strangers on the streets anymore.. just walked by quickly and pretended that i didn't hear them.  but then i've told a number of friends these and they all said they would never talk to strangers on roads like i did! so apparently i'm really weird! either that or i'm just easy to pick up?!? *LOL* or i'm just very gullible. let's see, few weeks ago some guy started talking to me on the bus too and i would talk back to him... only that he turned out to be a complete freak and scared the hell outta me. but yah, i guess i'm not that wary of strangers?! that's actually a very dangerous thing for me to act like that tho.. (--___--);;;  am so contradicted. i always think of myself as the type who doesn't trust others easily. yet a lot of times i think others think of me as the type who'd easily trust ppl. it's like i get easily cheated by ppl on internet too. *sigh* i'm just sooo gullible. tho i dunno what i should do to overcome that?!

      ah the other day at this bookstore in richmond centre, me and sami saw these japanese comix english versions. and it described mars as  "a bad boy can change a good girl forever" ... *LOL* that's the funniest thing i've read in a long time!!! can't believe they summed up the whole comic in that one sentence tho.. cuz i mean mars was much more than that! but haha, it sure was a super eye-catching phrase.. at least it caught mine and i love it lots! hehe~   am always attracted to the wrong type of guys. either playboy or bad boy... jeeez. it's like fatal attraction, really. *sigh*

      finally finished re-organizing my pix! yay! just sent off these elementary reunion pix flora asked for~ it's almost 2 weeks since she wrote to me to ask for them.. ah ha.. i'm just lazy to go look thru my old notebook computer, but it's all good now! i'm finally done with this! feels great finishing something~ (^O^)  tho other than my own pix, there're still tons of these GLAY pix scattering across numerous discs (@__@);; dunno how to organize those.. gonna take up freaking long time! so i'll just put that off again~ haha. have too many GLAY pix i love.. it's just hard to organize.  put up a digital photo album too. had one with yahoo few yrs ago. but these days they changed the outlook or something cuz the pix are all the same size! i had pix before that used to be bigger, yet they just automatically shrinked them down! (&gt;__  and it's funny, i finally remembered the other day that i had used to wanna call my blog "Peach Life". tho now that i've already come up with some other name, i'll use that old one with the photo album then~ haha (^-^)

      for the past 3 days i went to sleep at 2am. cuz i figure i've been having trouble falling asleep lately, so i might as well go sleep later by tiring myself out first. see if i can fall asleep faster this way. well i did fall asleep ok, but i woke up naturally at like 7-8am!!! (@__@);; and to think it was the weekend! it's so weird! i tend to sleep later on weekends at like around 2am too before but i would wake up at 11am! man.. something's really wrong with my sleep these days...   this is gonna be such a busy week i dun even know how i'm gonna do stuff now..  mon - read weekend newspapers. i always have newspapers pile up on the weekends just cuz the weekend ones tend to be a lot more than the weekday ones. and i typically get so busy on the weekends running around i hardly get the time to sit down and take the time to read! (&gt;__  tues - dinner with alyson. and so i think in the afternoon i'll go to kerrisdale cuz i'll be dressed up anywayz. haha.. yah.. it's all just an excuse to go to td bank to see the guy!!! hahaha~ and yes, tomorrow i will have to go to the bank cuz i'll be soon outta cash again! OH i have to pick up my sheets too! it's been like 2 weeks! and i really wanna go to cafe to write these summer greeting cards. am always sooo slow when it comes to writing cards. if i don't get these out soon before i know it summer'll be at the end again! cuz damn! i can't believe half of july already passed away! just like that! (&gt;____  wed - go to downtown to see how that devil bldg celebrates its 20th bday. *LOL* no my real purpose is to go walk around commodore to see where i can park for the next nite when i go to concert. wanna go to that oriente cafe too, and gonna go write cards there as well. oh and i wanna go do shopping too~ lalala~  thurs - send auntie wu off to the airport around noon. hoobastank concert at nite. not sure what i'm gonna do for the other parts of the day. either rest and prepare my energy for the live, or just do more job search.  fri - so far nothing yet. but then i'll probably need the day to rest after concert anywayz. see if i can get interviews to put on that day too, if i do get any this week. so far i haven't got any cuz i haven't sent stuff out.. ah ha.  sat - dentist at noon. bbq at nite. (*O*)   i'm really supposed to clean up the house and do laundry like last week! aaaah! seems like there's no time to do those this week~ damn.. will have to put off till sunday or next week.. am just gonna keep procrastinate (^O^);; really could've done those yesterday cuz i was free and home. yet i went around scanning and organizing pix. it's still all a huge mess. i've got pix everywhere on tons of discs! have absolutely no idea how i'm gonna organize them...

      aah, instant messengers, hate them while loving them at the same time and can't live without them. been using icq for 6 yrs now. tho i think i'm gonna delete it sometime this week just cuz nowadays everyone's using msn. started to use msn only since last sept, am soo slow haha. so my msn experience is not even a yr yet! been thinking these days that it's no point really in keeping 2 programs while it's mostly the same ppl on both lists anywayz so me gonna delete the icq account. i like to keep things simple.  tho somehow 2 months ago i started to do things to complicate myself up. someone found me thru msn search and wanted to add me. i thought the guy's profile sounded really interesting.. well.. something about he's the ceo of an internet marketing firm *LOL* and he's only 27! so yah, i wanna know how he got to be the ceo at such a young age! but since the email account i use with msn includes my real name and stuff, i don't wanna add the guy using that account. i don't like to tell ppl personal info before i get to talk to them. so i signed up a different msn account to add the guy. yet i never saw him online and i rarely used that account anywayz. so that 1st month i've had that account it was basically just idle.  later on johnny sent me this cool msn add-on program that let u put up big pix. and u get to use multiple accounts with it. around that same time i got screwed, and these 3 weird guys tried adding me on icq. i didn't know at first what the whole thing was about, so i talked to them. when they asked for msn account, i just gave them that new one then cuz it's for ppl i dunno in real life anywayz.  now that i think about it, i don't really know why the hell i went to sign up that new account?!?? hmm so far there's only 5 guys on it. am thinking these days i'm gonna delete that account. it's too much trouble and weird having these 2 msn accounts. why the hell did i go sign it up to complicate myself anywayz?!? jeeez. sometimes i think i am sooo fickle. is strange actually for a taurus to be like that. i thought taurus ppl are supposed to be not liking change?! yet i change sooo often.  haven't made new net friends in like 3-4 yrs. and the past month talking to these guys have got me into thinking about the whole net friends business again. it's sooo weird. this one guy who found me from the whole shit, so we didn't start off well and of course i have bad image of him cuz of that, he's sooo hung up on me for some reason that's way beyond my comprehension! i'm sooo goddamn cold to him yet he's soo masochistic or something he still keeps wanting to talk to me! jeeez. cuz seriously, if i were him, i would never wanna talk to myself! hah! on one hand i have to say he's good to be soo persistent, yet it's actually really annoying to me that he acts like that. he kept asking me to talk on the phone and would just give me his cell#. i told him i'm not interested in that at all and kept telling him no way, yet he still doesn't get it!!! am sooo tired each time having to deny him... aaargh. some guys just really don't get it, no matter how many times u've said 'no' to them...  and it amazes me. how can he be soo obsessed with me anywayz while we've never even met? i didn't show him my pix either, so really, he doesn't know anything about me! yet somehow he just kept saying he's sure i'm a nice girl and blah blah, while all along i was sooo cold to him. so how the freaking hell would he just think i must be a nice girl anywayz from the way i acted?!?? cuz i mean, if it's someone who i know in real life who acts that way, then i can probably still understand it. but if it's just someone who u dunno at all, how the hell can u be obsessed with them?!?!?  the other thing, they would just keep asking for pix soon after chatting. but for me, i thought the whole point in making friends from the net is that u get to know the person inside. if u care about the looks so much, why don't u just go meet someone in real life where u get to see rite then and there how the others look?!  aaargh. dunno. it's all soo confusing. sometimes i kinda regret i got myself into this whole mess. my life would've just been a lot simpler if i had ignored all of them. just follow the policy i've been following for yrs, only add ppl u know in real life! but then sometimes i'd think since my life is already soo simple these days that i hardly ever get to meet new ppl, it'd be interesting to meet ppl this way too. so i dunno. i'm really just contradicting myself.  but well one thing's for sure. i've made up my mind now that sometime this week i'm just gonna delete the icq and the new msn account. am just gonna go back to be like before, keep the one true msn account and keep everything simple. voila!   urlLink    the new MSN account i signed up 2 months ago for net friends... it really just has 5 ppl on it. but aaah stupid me (&gt;___</post></Blog>
