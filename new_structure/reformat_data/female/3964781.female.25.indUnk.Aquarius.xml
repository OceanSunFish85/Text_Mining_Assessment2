      I created this forum out of boredom and restlessness. One of the only things missing in my life is an inspiring form of self expression. I have been in search ofsomething so inspiring and have yet to find it, hence the restlessness. Sure, there are things I do that I enjoy, but I feel as though my mind has journeyed beyond some of those things and is starving for something new. The only thing I find inspiring is music, and lately I wonder if even the artists need more inspiration than I do. The thing thatintrigued me the most today was a Celestial Seasonings box. Inside was a magnet that read, "Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues." The best part was the picture of hot air balloons made out of tangerines and teacups. I have been thinking about the concept of passion all weekend and the fact that there isn't much I do that I feel passionate about lately. My job is great but I am not much for routine. Routine has leeched on my creativity and originality for so long that I don't think I even know how to jump start mymind to think outside of its box. Sure, routine is a part of life, but prisons and institutions create routine. Life shouldn't feel this way. Now I ask myself, if life is limited to the prison stripes of routine than how can I color it with passion?

      Last night I sink onto the couch ready to relax with a tub of 'Bites O Brownie' and my two friends the Vapor Brothers. Not a bad treat after a long day, but unfortunately I didn't want to share;) Crumbs start to fly as I shove bite after bite o brownie into my mouth. Much to my dismay a few pieces crumble onto the floor. In the heat of my oral pleasure I immediately lean over and put the fallen pieces into my mouth. Past my lips and onto my tongue the brownie went. Then the brownie suddenly came to life and crawled back off my tongue and onto my lip. What brownie would ever squirm at it's own beloved fate?? Why one with eight legs of course! I spit the now slimy spider onto my hand, fling it back onto the floor, ran to the sink, and spit every last crumb of brownie out of my mouth. The spider was still alive but injured. Remember, always share or you might hurt a spider:)
