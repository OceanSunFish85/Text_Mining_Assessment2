      The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it... I can resist everything but temptation.  urlLink Oscar Wilde     So I called him. We talked for quite a long time, just like we always did. I love talking to him on the phone. We used to talk for hours. He always cracked me up, and frankly I find him fascinating, and I'm not just saying that because he rocks my world. In fact, if we're not having sex, I much prefertalking to him on the phone than actually hanging out with him. He is  quirky . We discussed all the reasons why I quit him. He said we used to have fun and we could again if I could get out of my head. He says I overthink things (he's right.) We DID have fun and it was the perfect situation until I started trying to figure it out. I started trying to figure it out because I started wanting to be with him all the time. My body  craved  him...and that just pissed me off.        So then I started power dating in the hopes that I'd meet someone who could possibly distract me from that craving. There was Dentistman (who was actually kinda fun,) Brokerman (no chemistry but such a nice guy,) surferman (oh my, still seeing him,) writerboy (smart, smart, awesome to talk to, but soo young,) and mostly out of town claims-adjusterman (a blast to hang with.) The only thing all the dating did was distract me from my  life  to the point that my friends nearly held an intervention...and on thinking about it, rightly so.        I don't know how men manage to juggle dating several women at the same time. It was extremely difficult to juggle dating several men, and men don't even call that often! If I was man trying to juggle 3 women who all called every other day I'd go crazy. Have I just stumbled on the reason why menARE crazy?..lol. Surely that is part of why they are so terrible about calling back.        And really, the thing is, I don't want a relationship, don't have time tofeed and care fora relationship, ...I don't have any particular  longing  to be part of a couple.        What I  would like  is to have someone whose company I really enjoy, with whom I could have really fun sex, and who might be willing to go do stuff now and then, and if this situation was able to exist for a good while, so much the better.  That  would be a perfect situation. Ironically, that was exactly the situation I was already in! And I resigned from it! Good grief. To be fair though, it was starting to feel relationship-y, and in my more rational moments I recognized that and was concerned by it. And I sort of was starting to fall for him, (concerning also, because I was fully aware that even if it WERE reciprocated, given his considerable quirks, it would never work, I couldn't love him that way.)  Certainly he noticed it too and I suspect that is why he put the brakes on. I'm glad he did.        So I visited him and it was really really good to see him. It was his birthday.He kissed me...I've never been kissed by anyone who kisses better.He isexquisite. He rocked my world until I begged him to stop, only he didn't stop...lol. I'm glad that we are friends again and I told him so. Hereminded me to stay mindful that we are  friends. I feel like I will. But I'mconfident that he'll put the brakes on again if I start to get loopy. At that point I'll either re-focus or quit for good.    I'm even more confident that I'm going to keep trying to figure out where my mind derailed from my brain and why I started acting so possessive (and even jealous?)

      When I log on to the computer now I get a message from Mr. Rockmyworld saying "Hi....it's Mr. Crack, have you met a new dealer yet?" Pfft. Jackass.I can't tell if he's busting my chops or really bothered? Do I care? NO( yes )!!! Hopefully soon he will become so annoying that he becomes loathesome.I estimate thatto beabout 4 days out if he continues on like this.   I had dinner last night with aman (date #2)who is so positive and happy. He's totally buff because he lives in the gym. He's funny, educated, sort of interesting, andverrrry interested in me. I  was  looking pretty hotwhich I'm sure that turned the interest in me up a notch. I have lost about 40 lbs since I invitedmy future ex-husband (who I affectionately refer to as my baby' daddy) to leave. But I digress.Mr. C'mon-get-happy invited me to his place. I declined. I'm not feeling the chemistry even though I can tell he is. I hate that. I  want  to want a guy who won't toy with me. What is  wrong  with me?   My house is trashed. Ugh.   Gotta get ready for work.

      I am newly single, therefore I date. I work full-time, therefore I have personal ads on internet dating sites. How is that going? It's going surprisingly well. Of course, it doesn't hurt that there are about 4 men for every woman on the internet sites. That allows even someone like me to be selective.I have emailed and met men who I would not have otherwise had an opportunity to meet. I have met an engineer, a dentist, several business owners, a chef, several financial planners (it might be coincidence, but financial planners seem to be WAY over-represented on online dating sites), a lawyer and a part-time magician. For the most part they were all very normal seeming, really cool guys. I dated several for a while. I've even been having sex! Who knew it was still so much fun?   One man  trifled  with my affections. I knew I was a flavor of the month, but I was ok with it because OMG, he was so gorgeous and funny and interestingon lots of different levelsand made my body to respond in ways I didn't even know were possible. And anyway, I was just looking for a good time and I accepted his evasiveness andtrifling waysas part of his package deal. Guess who I fell for?Oh yes, you know who it was. It wasn't like an in-love kind of falling for him, rather I just couldn't get enough of him. I  craved him. When he moved on to the next flavor of the month I thought I would go crazy. I told him that being with him was like smoking crack, to which he took great offense. Pffft. Could I just drop it then? Oh no. I was on my period and was overcome with this need to  explain  myself, in a realllly long email no less. Good grief. Like THAT helped anything.   So now, several weeks later, I'm over it/him (mostly.) I still get the craving.....but I'm dating others who are doing a fair job of distracting me from it. That's how men date, no?

       I called in sick today and wasn't really sick...totally faked it. I just didn't want to go in. It was rainy this morning when I woke up and I just wanted to lay on the couch. Did I? Oh no, I surfed the internet all day! I should've just gone to work. Now I'm going to have a million emails that all need something and a stack of paperwork on my desk. Oh! As if that weren't bad enough, future ex-husband (who was rained out at work and came and took daughter for the day since I had to "  work") called because he couldn't reach me at work. So I lied and said I came home early because I had a touch of food poisoning. I must've been very convincing because he said I sounded terrible. O what a tangled web we weave....      Two more weeks until school starts for the kids. Thank God. Whoever invented summer vacation was clearly not a FT working single mother. In the next two weeks I have to be school supplies and uniforms for daughter. I told daughter that there were only two weeks left of summer and she just looked stunned!!       She is 8. I'm crazy about her. She doesn't care much for me though. She's a daddy's girl through and through. I have to keep reminding myself that I didn't sign up to be liked by her. I'm sure she'll figure out lots more ways to break my heart before it's all said and one. The best I can hope for is that she'll come out mature, smart, and purposeful when she comes out the other end!
