      how many blogs do i want to run? hmm.   of course there's my  urlLink é£åæ¥ä¸½çä¸å¤© , but that's for random ramblings when my brain for whatever reason thinks in chinese.    urlLink s.l.s.b.  has become very personal. can hardly call it a blog, since i hardly link anything from there.  but sometimes, there're certain articles are just too funny to not share. so i suppose i could use another blog....  welcome to spice  rice.

       urlLink Bush Seeks More Control Over AIDS Act   Bush said that the $2 billion Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which since 1990 has been the government's largest subsidy of medical and other services specifically for HIV-positive people in the United States, "takes too little account of the most urgent needs." He said the administration should have greater power to decide where the money is distributed and how it is spent, focusing more on paying for medicine and doctors' visits than on social services.   Nothing this man believes I can agree. I do not intentionally set out to disagree with him or dislike him. But the truth is, I so far  always  seem to.   Developed countries face different issues when dealing with the AIDS epidemic, compared to third world countries. In a country like the US, where people do know about AIDS to varying degrees, problems such as ignorance on basic facts, logistics and distribution of drugs and physical access to medical treatment are probably not as critical.   However, whether people know the facts about the disease does not change the fact that the social stigma of being HIV-positive (whether it's developed into full-blown AIDS or not) remains. Social services to HIV-positive patients include giving subsidies for daily expenses such as transportation and child care, providing counselling services, community building and so on. I don't see how social services are any less relevant than medical treatment.   As it is with any government program, funds are never enough. More importantly, who should decide the priorities? In this case, I'm not inclined to think it should be the federal government.

      I watched Bush's State of Union speech on TV in 2003, and was quite skeptical of most of what he said, especially on issues to do with terrorism and foreign affairs. But when he mentioned setting aside USD 15 billion for a 5-year plan to fight AIDS, I became more hopeful.   So it seems  urlLink Vietnam has now become the 15th nation eligible for help under his AIDS plan . I would like to find out more of how the plan is coming along now. How much has already been spent? How much on federal programs and how much on international programs? Which are the other 14 countries? What is the money been spent on?   Bush outlined a three-part strategy: supporting prevention program, providing better treatment, and ensuring life-saving drugs get to the neediest patients as quickly as possible. Seems like common sense to me, there's nothing unique about it. What strikes me from that article is this: "He emphasized abstinence as key to fighting AIDS."    Read what Pekingduck's said about  urlLink AIDS in China . In truth, sexual promiscuity (or unsafe sex, for that matter) is not always the primary reason for the spread of the disease. What about transmission by dirty needles? To many other countries, the AIDS epidemic is more about ignorance, fear and poverty.   Come to think of it, USD 15 billion probably isn't enough.

       urlLink Al Qaeda is an ideology   It's an easy read, but rather informative, for someone relatively new to Middle Eastern politics.   What is the objective of the Al Qaeda? Would capturing Bin Laden resolve the problem of Islamic militants? What's the role of Saudi Arabia in the Islamic extremist movement? Where are the Islamic moderates and how do they compare to the radicals? Are they going to be using weapons of mass destruction?   Of course, there's no easy way to win the war on terror, but the first step to finding it has to be in understanding the problem. And if people continue to talk about Al Qaeda like it's the root of all evil and therefore its eradication would solve all problems, they are not helping.

       urlLink South Korean hostage beheaded    It was a grim piece of news greeting me at work this morning. I had been monitoring the news, and hoping for a turn for the better, whatever that may be. But when my friend messaged me and told me what we feared had indeed happened...I couldn't be surprised.   I cannot claim to understand what they are truly after. Do they really believe that the South Korean government would be pressured into withdrawing their troops contribution to iraq? Or are they publicizing a killing they would have carried out anyway in order to strike terror into the uneducated and weak? What are their objectives in executing civilians in such a manner?   What can possibly justify the inhumanity such horrific crimes -  how can this be the best possible solution to their problem?

       urlLink Koizumi wants to be Lord Jun      Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has pledged to be called "Lord Jun" by adoring fans, a cheeky reference to a South Korean TV drama currently sweeping all before it in Japan.   Speaking before a gathering of about 800 women supporters of candidates for Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party, the prime minister's "Lord" call was inspired by "Fuyu no Sonata," the South Korean program that has picked up a huge following in Japan, especially among middle-aged women.   Bae Yong Jun, the actor playing the lead role in the program is referred to in Japan as "Yon Sama (Lord Yong)," with thousands of middle-aged women lining the roads to greet him when he visited Japan in March.   Koizumi hopes voters will one day call him Lord Jun.  I didn't know Bae Yong Jun was referred to as "Yon Sama", but in any case "Jun-chan" sounds so much better than "Jun-sama". To me, anyway. Oh well.

       urlLink i am not kidding    American-born panda Hua Mei is pregnant, just months after she settled into her new home in southwestern China, state newspapers reported Wednesday.   The 4-year-old panda, whose name means "China-America," was the first foreign-born panda to return to its ancestral homeland. She arrived in February from the San Diego Zoo, where she was born to two pandas on loan from China.    Chinese veterinarians, concerned that she had little knowledge of sex after living only in captivity, showed her videos of mating pandas to prepare her for a series of "blind dates."   link from  urlLink danwei , via  urlLink peking duck .

       urlLink Out of the Dark In Rural China     An interesting and easy read. This article paints a simple but stirring picture of the disparity between urban and rural China and the transformation slowly taking place as technology spreads to the forgotten corners of rural China.    In the  urlLink 2004 Cost of Living ranking released by Mercer , Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are ranked No. 11, 16 and 32 respectively (Singapore is ranked No. 46). It's hard to imagine these same bustling cities in the same picture as the villages portrayed in the article. The villagers who live on less than SGD150 a year and have electricity only for a few hours every night to reduce wear and tear on the generator they share, and the hip young Shanghainese ladies with the newest mobile phones, they are all part of the same diverse China.   Makes me think twice about switching on my aircon to escape the heat and mosquitoes.

       urlLink Kim's execution video banned     The government and Internet portal sites said yesterday they would take stern measures against the possible spread on the Internet of the video showing the beheading of the Korean hostage.    Having watched the Nick Berg video, I can imagine how disturbing watching Kim's video would be. It would be a painful sight for his family, my condolences to them as well. But still - why should the pictures and video footage be banned? It is a painful but irrefutable fact that he had been killed in a gruesome manner, and there are people out there who need to have a first-hand look at exactly how gruesome it was. A sight that one will not forget, and a visual piece of memory that can motivating one into action. Or at the very least, debate.   The way I see it, the ban on the video is likely a measure aiming to prevent anti-government and anti-war sentiments in Korea from escalating any further. Kim's death is a deeply emotional issue. Prior to his death, the country was divided in its decision to deploy its troops to Iraq, and now, I dare say voices supporting the deployment are likely to have been muted at least temporarily while the opposing voices gain extra strength. Kim has become a martyr - against his will, but he has - and the government cannot afford to allow public emotions to run any higher. But shouldn't the media be given the right to censor as per their own discretion? There are humans running these website, newspapers, TV stations - they must know where the balance between human compassion and professional duty lies, it is most irresponsible to place a ban in the name of respect towards the victim's family.     On a related (or erm actually not) note, Korea is following China's example of clamping down on blogs on the internet.  urlLink See here for an appeal letter by Kevin Kim  (via  urlLink Pekingduck ).

       urlLink The Onion | Nation's Liberals Suffering From Outrage Fatigue   According to a study released Monday by the Hammond Political Research Group, many of the nation's liberals are suffering from a vastly diminished sense of outrage.  "With so many right-wing shams to choose from, it's simply too daunting for the average, left-leaning citizen to maintain a sense of anger," said Rachel Neas, the study's director. "By our estimation, roughly 70 percent of liberals are experiencing some degree of lethargy resulting from a glut of civil-liberties abuses, education funding cuts, and exorbitant military expenditures."   Oh damn, so funny.    'Yes, we all hate Cheney. He's an evil puppet-master. Yes, Bush is dumb. This is obvious. How many times can we say it? Now, excuse me, will you let me through so I can microwave my burrito?'"

       urlLink World failing in AIDS fight   New HIV infections hit a record high last year as the virus continues to outpace the global effort to contain it, according to a U.N. report published Tuesday.  The number of people living with the AIDS virus has risen in every region of the world. Last year, 5 million people became infected -- more than in any single year since the crisis began. Nine out of 10 who urgently need treatment are not getting it and prevention is still only reaching one in five people who should have it, the report said.   Key numbers:  Number infected: 40 million  Number of deaths each year: 3 miillion  Total accumulated number of deaths since 1981: 20 million  It was estimated in the report that to tackle the pandemic, USD 12 billion a year is required by next year, and by 2007, USD 20 billion a year would be needed, to provide drugs to 6 million people, AIDS tests for 100 million adults, HIV education in schools and care for 22 million AIDS orphans.   For reference purposes, the number of people infected is equivalent to more than 10 'Singapore's (in terms of population). The number of deaths per year is about one entire Singapore. The US has committed USD 15 billion for fighting AIDS in the  next 5 years , while USD 12 billion is required for  next year . (And the US is the largest contributor to global AIDS funds, as far as I know.)

       urlLink Safety Scandal Shames Mitsubishi    Shiho Okamoto was killed while walking home from a neighborhood video store with her two young sons when a 220-pound wheel fell off the front axle of a Mitsubishi truck moving behind her. The wheel crushed Okamoto's skull and spine.  [...]A raid on Mitsubishi offices five months ago yielded the evidence that exploded into one of the largest corporate scandals ever in Japan. Authorities say seized documents, and subsequent admission of fault by Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (MMC) and a spinoff, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck  Bus Co., indicate that since the 1980s, the automakers systematically hid defects involving 800,000 vehicles. Among the hidden flaws were defective front axles on the same type of truck as that involved in Okamoto's death.  Integral to this scandal is the lack of punitive measures in Japan against corporations in such cover ups. It was argued in the article that consumer rights are second to large corporations in Japan, especially when legislators appear to believe that societal shame to the brand name in producing defective products is enough to keep these corporations in check.   Tsk tsk.

       urlLink US Parties to Allow Bloggers to Cover Party Conventions for First Time   More than 15,000 people will converge on Boston later this month to cover the Democratic National Convention -- including, for the first time, bloggers.   The Democratic Party plans to give media credentials to a select group of bloggers who want to cover the event, where Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.) is expected to accept his party's presidential nomination. The group has not announced which bloggers might get the passes, but that information will come in the "next few weeks," an event spokeswoman said. The convention begins July 26.   But officials said whoever gets credentials will have the same opportunities to cover the four-day event that journalists enjoy. "We want to treat them just the same as other reporters," said Mike Liddell, the convention's director of online communications. "We're even planning to do a breakfast for them the first day of the convention."   The Republican Party recently decided that it will also give bloggers credentials for its convention later this summer. A spokesman for the event said it is still working out details.  It's hardly surprising, however. Especially considering the fact that a blogger is entitled to be biased and partisan unlike journalists, it is time that political parties wake up to the propagandistic power of a blog in their favor. The reverse is also true, of course, that one wrong step can prove disastrous should opposing bloggers pick up on the faux pas, whether the mainstream media does or not.   As mentioned briefly in the article, a political blog provides excellent reach to students and youngsters, who generally rely more heavily on the Internet for information. It seems that blogs (with comments enabled) provide a potentially limitless platform for discussion and intellectual interaction for some of these new age netizens. With this year's higher emphasis on the younger voters, parties can probably get their messages out to a larger audience, including those traditionally less interested in politics. Furthermore, I imagine they can also more easily monitor in real time the people's response to them.   'Tis the power of blogs, they say.

       urlLink Fallen Comrade Not Far From Hearts, Minds    Gathering on a small basketball court outside battalion headquarters, 450 soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division bowed their heads in prayer to begin Independence Day celebrations at this dusty outpost on the edge of Sadr City.  Then, as the morning warmed toward searing midday heat, 11 soldiers stepped forward to receive Purple Hearts for battle wounds suffered in the past few weeks, including the battalion commander. Hundreds more were given Combat Infantryman Badges before Sgt. Eric Bourquin, a lanky 24-year-old from College Station, Tex., stepped forward to accept a Bronze Star for meritorious service decorated with a small "V" pin for valor.  On April 4, Bourquin helped seize and hold a three-story building at a moment when it appeared his platoon would be overwhelmed by members of a Shiite militia that had risen on the filthy streets of Sadr City, a Baghdad slum. Nearly a third of Bourquin's 35-member platoon was wounded that day, one of them fatally. Sgt. Yihjyh L. Chen, perched in the gunner's nest of a Humvee, was killed when a bullet passed through his lungs and heart. Six other soldiers from the battalion died in the ensuing battle.   "That's what patriotism is all about," said Bourquin, a member of 1st Platoon, Charlie Company.  and the poignant last paragraphs:  Aguero's platoon rested for much of the day. Then, near twilight, it pushed past the camp's maze of barriers and checkpoints to escort a military police unit back to camp.   "Every time you roll out of these gates, April 4 is what's on everyone's mind, not the back of it but the front," Aguero said.   Before leaving his room in the dorm-like barracks, Aguero gestured toward the screen of his Dell laptop computer glowing at the foot of his bed. A souvenir portrait of Sadr hung overhead.   He closed the e-mail window, leaving a screen saver depicting a podium and seven pairs of beige army boots. A rifle stood behind each pair, capped with a Kevlar helmet. The scene showed the memorial service for the soldiers killed three months ago.   "Those are Sergeant Chen's," Aguero said, pointing to the empty pair on the far left. "What do you think I'm thinking about today?"   i'm not American, of course, and I disagree with much of the US policy with Iraq. But, I do feel for the soldiers, I imagine the scene of the memorial service as portrayed in the article and I am all ready to tear up. I am anti-war but I am not anti-troops, so to speak.   I wonder though, what Bourquin meant when he said, "This is what patriotism is all about."   What  is  patriotism? To put one's life on the line for the country's security? For the country's ideals? How does one define one's duty towards one's country as a patriotic citizen?

       urlLink Education on AIDS to Be Compulsory in Beijing   AIDS prevention education is set to become mandatory in Beijing, China Daily said on Tuesday.   A course for high school students will be taught beginning this autumn semester and has been listed as mandatory.   The Beijing Municipal Commission of Education has also decided that primary school students should begin the English language learning as early as the first year in school.   The English classes are also scheduled to begin in the autumn semester in September, local authorities said Tuesday.   Currently, students in primary schools do not have English classes until the third year.   Junior middle schools in the capital city are required to arrange four hours of classes on AIDS prevention on each of the three years of junior secondary education.   Although some middle schools have already started AIDS prevention classes, they were not mandatory and educational authorities had not set them as an education requirement, an official with the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, who asked to be named Tang, said Tuesday.   This isn't a new article, it's dated some time in June. I kept it because it's one of those that bothered me though i didn't quite understand why. Then it hit me today. It was this:   This is to meet demands for Beijing to host the 2008 Olympic Games and the city's fast development, Tang explained.   There is more communication with overseas people in Beijing than other Chinese cities, he pointed out.   I had to assume he was referring the language courses, and not the AIDS prevention or narcotics prevention courses. Is it not disturbing, if children were to take these classes only because "hey you'll be talking to foreigners, you'd better know how to speak English and not sound ignorant"? Shouldn't it be more of "hey you'd better know this, this could save your life or someone else's"? It boggles my mind how AIDS and narcotics abuse prevention could be bundled together with foreign language education.   If it's indeed that it's for the sake of public image that's got Beijing finally to pay attention to the need for AIDS prevention education, I am disgusted.

       urlLink Fear and Ignorance Barriers to China's AIDS Fight   China belatedly acknowledged the country's exploding HIV/AIDS problem when Premier Wen Jiabao shook hands with a victim in 2003, but there is still a long way to go before the deadly virus can be countered.  Arthur Pang, a doctor with humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres and who treated AIDS patients in China's central Hubei province this year, said expensive drugs and stigma associated with the disease were still keeping sufferers from the treatment they needed.  It's depressing, reading about the epidemic in China, for the kind of neglect and discrimination victims suffer.   Yesterday, an otherwise worldwise friend commented, "Well, but it's not such a bad way to die. At least they had a good time before they..." It's clear her assumption was that most of the victims contracted AIDS from promiscuity, and thereby "had a good time" before they had to suffer the consequences. I was angry! Furious beyond words, that she could even make such an assumption. Though she quickly qualified her statement, "Well, excluding those who got it from intravenous injections and so on," the damage had been done. Is this the kind of stigma we have to counter? If an educated Singaporean executive can think this way, what about the average illiterate Chinese farmer?

       urlLink A Shrinking Base    I wouldn't count on the article to be objective or authoritative information - military rules dictate that military personnel are not allowed to be polled for their opinion. But it does give some random snapshot pictures of what these military men and their families feel about the war and their involvement. Some rather poignant snapshots.    While she's talking she notices Corey Jr. behind her. He just won a prize for a Cub Scout essay about how he wanted to be a soldier, she says brightly.   "No I don't," he answers.   "How come?"   "Bang. Bang," he says, pointing his finger at his chest and turning his head to the wall in mock death.    They have loyalty to the President (at least initially), patriotism for their country, fear from witnessing and experiencing the horrors of war, and their love for their family, and all these different elements may pull or push them in different directions to their attitude towards the war. Each soldier and each member of a military family, has to find a way to find a balance. And find peace.

       urlLink Dr Jiang Yanyong released     Jiang Yanyong, the military doctor who exposed China's SARS cover-up last year, has been released after seven weeks in custody during which he underwent "study sessions", family members say.   Jiang, 72, who had been taken into custody on June 1 months after calling for a political reassessment of the ill-fated 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, returned to his Beijing home, but was under strict orders not to talk to the media, his family said.  I cannot claim to understand. Honestly. Of what the government wanted of him.    He was taken in for the letter he wrote to the leaders of the CCP requesting a reappraisal of their actions in the Tiananmen incident, which in itself could have angered them, but would not have warranted such a drastic action, especially since he has been a loyal member of the party, and is not in any position to challenge their authority. It would have taken only some vague reply to the letter, to temporarily shut him up, if not pacify him. In contrast with the SARS cover-up, a retrospective reappraisal does not inspire the same urgency for change and action.   The problem arose only from the leakage of the letter to the media. Given Dr Jiang's status as a widely respected hero among the Chinese, the government is right to fear the possible public unrest inspired by his letter. Yet, since the letter had indeed already been leaked, and is obviously already out of his hands, what good does it do to take him in, only to cause only a more serious uproar for the obvious act of oppression of the beloved doctor?   The fact that he was put through "study sessions" or put more bluntly, brainwashing sessions suggests that the officials had wanted to change his mind, perhaps of the Tiananmen incident, perhaps of something of a bigger scale, who knows. But why do they think they would be able to effect that change? He is an old man with a mind of his own, and a fearless passion for his country. He must respect the authorities to a certain aspect, to have chosen to go through the official channel of writing a letter requesting for the reassessment, rather than work his popularity to his advantage. He is not the average ill-informed citizen, surely he's also not unaware of the tactics that can be employed against him.    urlLink Here  is the letter he wrote, by the way, translated. And the concluding words:    I believe that correct assessment of the June 4th Incident is what the people want and it will never cause unrest among the people. The claim that stability is of overriding importance can in fact cause even greater instability. For years, each time before June 4th, some people, like sitting on thorns, are in a state of extreme nervousness. They would not know how many people would be mobilized this time to prevent disturbances. This has been the case year after year. The uneasiness has not gradually diminished just because the June 4th Incident has become farther and farther away. On the contrary, the people have become increasingly disappointed and angry.   After repeated deliberations, I think I must write you this letter. Of course I have considered the consequences that I might encounter after writing this letter. But I have decided to tell you all the facts. If you think it is necessary, please talk to me at your convenience.

       urlLink How USD15 billion should (not) be spent   The U.S. global AIDS plan stipulates that by 2006 one-third of the money spent on HIV prevention must be used for "abstinence until marriage" programs, about 7 percent of the $15 billion budget.  An analysis of grants awarded under the plan, conducted by a Maryland-based organization monitoring U.S. international health policy, found that a large amount of the prevention money is being used in programs to prevent infected mothers from passing HIV to their babies. This mode of transmission accounts for only 5 percent of new infections in Africa, the region primarily targeted by the Bush plan.   Jodi L. Jacobson, executive director of the Maryland-based Center for Health and Equity, which conducted the analysis, said that relatively little money is going to prevent HIV transmission through heterosexual intercourse, which accounts for about 80 percent of infections in Africa. When the organization studied grants to programs directed at that risk group, "between 60 and 80 percent of all money is going to abstinence-only programs," she said.   The US global AIDS coordinator defended the policy:  On the topic of sexual abstinence, which has been strongly debated during the conference, he said the administration's approach was fair and focused on "A-B-C," or "Abstinence" and "Be Faithful" and "Condom Use," in that order.   "Abstinence works. Being faithful works. Condoms work," he said. "Each has its place."   which is contradictory, is it not? A-B-C, "in that order," then that "each has its place?" If they each have its place, why the priority on abstinence?   As far as prevention measures go, how does abstinence help married women in countries where they do not necessarily have the right to refuse their husbands' advances? How does that help the prostitutes who (as sad it sounds) cannot feed themselves and their families without selling their bodies?  And don't even get me started on the other primary mode of transmission - tainted needles.   But anyway this only makes me even more curious as to how they are spending the USD 15 billion. 7% or USD 1.05 billion may sound like a lot to spend on abstinence programs, and I do not agree with it. But if allowing it is what it takes to get the other USD 13.95 billion out there, so be it.

      For a number of reasons, I would much prefer John Kerry to George Bush as President of USA. Though his nomination as presidential candidate would undoubtedly be confirmed at the Democratic National Convention, that's only the beginning.  urlLink He and the Democrats have their work cut out for them :  IN THE CONVENTION that climaxes tonight with the nomination of Sen. John F. Kerry, the Democratic Party has faced two basic challenges. Explaining the evils of the Bush administration is not one of them, for the delegates came to Boston with no doubts on that score. Nor is the normal quadrennial task of unifying the party a burden this year, because the Democrats are as hungry for victory, and as willing to sublimate their many disagreements, as the Republicans were in Philadelphia four years ago. Instead, Democratic leaders are focused, first, on reassuring the nation that it would be as safe or safer under Mr. Kerry's leadership as it is under President Bush's -- and, if they can make that case, on showing that Mr. Kerry would better relieve the economic insecurity that Democrats see as the overarching domestic issue of the election.  For a Singaporean with (obviously) no right to vote in the USA, I may seem rather concerned about the US presidential elections. But given the kind of cultural, financial, political and military clout America enjoys in global affairs, it would be rather naive to think who the commander-in-chief and executive head of the US government is shouldn't concern us non-Americans. Look where Bush got us?

      When I first found out about the ABC guideline the Bush administration imposed on the AIDS prevention fund,  urlLink this  was my response.   I mostly took issue with the 'abstinence' requirement, but in truth,  urlLink perhaps even 'being faithful' and 'condoms' still may not be able to save high-risk women in African states from the curse of AIDS.     "Abstinence is meaningless to women who are coerced into sex," she said.  "Faithfulness offers little protection to wives whose husbands have several partners or were infected before marriage. And condoms require the cooperation of men." [...] Sexual coercion takes place in many arenas in Africa. One of them is in the context of conflict. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan's Darfur, rape is used as a weapon of war. Thousands of women have been gang raped, some so violently that without intervention, they will suffer incontinence for the rest of their lives. [...] Sexual coercion can also be a matter of domestic violence â an acute problem in South Africa â or an element of an economically necessary liaison.  Many young women facing poor employment prospects enter into relationships â sometimes with a more financially secure older man, sometimes with a young man, sometimes with more than one man â that provide them with money for groceries, rent or small luxuries. Dubbed "transactional sex," it is sex for survival in some measure, and therefore the relationships are inherently unequal. A woman can't say no in such a situation and preserve her economic security.  As for "being faithful," fidelity is not always under women's control, activists and researchers point out. Infidelity plagues transactional relationships almost by definition, and it also enters marriages â especially unions in which the husband is much older than the wife. Even in faithful marriages, sexual history is a threat that does not discriminate.  Needless to say, the availability of condoms matters little in these instances. Only if a woman has negotiating power with regard to sex can she insist that her boyfriend or husband use a condom. Only if she is omniscient can she be certain it's not necessary.  I wonder if the Bush administration remembered to take a look at this larger picture when they decided on the ABCs?   (I still take very strong offence at the 'abstinence' requirement. It is clearly impractical and reeks of ideological, politically driven - pardon my language - bulls**t.)

      I read this other article just yesterday, where Muslims asked,  urlLink "Why does America hate us?" :  If you lived in the Middle East, you might easily believe that America is waging a worldwide war against Islam, and that Americans must hate Muslims. Would you be wrong?   In response to my post yesterday, a reader emailed, "I wish you would write about why they hate us. We Americans are genuinely puzzled."  Apparently Mr Bush has the answer:  "How do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is vitriolic hatred for America? I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I just can't believe it, because I know how good we are."   *roll eyes*  How do I explain this?   Nobody hates nobody. Muslims do not hate American  people , in fact many in the Middle East have a lot of respect for American institutions for higher learning and they enjoy interacting with Americans. The Americans don't hate Muslims either, there are many American Muslims who practise their religion in the freedom provided by the security of the country. No, this hatred does not exist on the personal level. This hatred stems from frustration and outrage at American policies and the American government, and the American people's ignorance and indifference to all the injustice non-Americans have had to suffer as a result of these policies.   How about some  urlLink history of American's actions in the Middle East ?   To the the Arabs, American policies are inconsistent and hypocritical. Just a few examples:  1) Iraq - guess who helped establish the Ba'th Socialist regime in Iraq and gave the go-ahead to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait then turned around and attacked Iraq for it in 1990?    2) Iran - guess who assisted in the removal of a popularly elected government to resurrect the autocratic shah? And hey now that the Shah is once again ousted, Iran is now labelled a member of the Axis of Evil.  3) Israel - 40% of US foreign aid goes to Israel, in support of an occupation that has on numerous occasions been deemed illegal by UN resolution.   4) Afghanistan - guess who gave Bin Laden his training and weapons?   At the same time the US gives political, financial and/or military support to oppressive autocracies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, the US attacks Iraq to "liberate" the Iraqis. At the same time the US imposes economic sanctions on Iraq, ineffective in removing Saddam, but has literally starved more than 1,000,000 Iraqis to death, the US and the rest of the world mourned and retaliated when 3,000 American adults died in the 9/11 incident.   Are they not justified in their grief and anger? Does America really fight for freedom and democracy as it claims?   It is clear to me, that the majority of the American population are not educated in matters of foreign affairs, neither are they interested to know. Presidents and congressmen are elected for their ability to provide economic and domestic security. They are not elected for their wisdom in managing America's foreign affairs, until some planes come hit their precious buildings and kill their precious people. As with all other policies, foreign policies are formulated with a dose of domestic political interest, lobby group pressures and shortsightedness.   In all domestic affairs, this is ideal of course - the forces for or against any particular resolution allow the resultant policy to strike a balance to best serve all those affected.   Alas, in the case of foreign affairs, people most directly affected by these policies - the  civilians  of these nations, have absolutely no influence over these policies. And the people who do have influence - the American voters so proud of their democratic system - turn a blind eye to their suffering while American oil companies and military-industrial complex reap their profits. From the first article:   President Clinton ordered US fighter-bombers to attack Iraq, ostensibly because Hussein had expelled UN weapons inspectors from his country. The "surgical strikes" of Operation Desert Fox, like previous and subsequent campaigns, maimed and killed defenseless Iraqi civilians. Meanwhile, virtually every news outlet in Egypt ran pictures of  grinning US seamen painting "Happy Ramadan" on the missiles destined for Baghdad.  Those pictures mocked the suffering of Muslims, just as they mocked my attempts at playing cultural ambassador.  That, my friend, is why they hate us. Because we seem to hate them.

I don't know what to say of that. Whatever it takes, I suppose.   The projects are "never going to get them to love America," said Potterf, the civil affairs officer. "Nobody is going to ever be waving an American flag. But I just want them to be neutral, to stop planting explosives."   The displaced and unemployed Iraqis do pose a serious security threat, both their economic and psychological vulnerability makes them easy targets to be recruited. Clearly giving money can only be a short term solution though. The people who hate the US will continue to do so, and bribing the neutral will only reduce the number of enemies, but not weaken the cause behind the hatred.

       urlLink Taming the multiverse   Parallel universes are no longer a figment of our imagination. They're so real that we can reach out and touch them, and even use them to change our world, says Marcus Chown.  [...] But how is it that atoms can be in many places at once whereas big things made out of atoms-tables, trees and pencils-apparently cannot? Reconciling the difference between the microscopic and the macroscopic is the central problem in quantum theory.  The many worlds interpretation is one way to do it. This idea was proposed by Princeton graduate student Hugh Everett III in 1957. According to many worlds, quantum theory doesn't just apply to atoms, says Deutsch. "The world of tables is exactly the same as the world of atoms."  But surely this means tables can be in many places at once. Right. But nobody has ever seen such a schizophrenic table. So what gives?  The idea is that if you observe a table that is in two places at once, there are also two versions of you-one that sees the table in one place and one that sees it in another place.  The consequences are remarkable. A universe must exist for every physical possibility. There are Earths where the Nazis prevailed in the Second World War, where Marilyn Monroe married Einstein, and where the dinosaurs survived and evolved into intelligent beings who read New Scientist.  This article came out some time ago - it's really only for my own reference that I'm putting the link here. Follow the links to the left for a layman's guide to quantum physics. The idea of a multiverse is mind-boggling, but gives rise to all these amazing possibilities.   There's an alternate universe, where Cindy is perhaps a suffering slave to Cockroach King of Siberia (or a place known as Siberia to us). Or a Cindy may not exist, for my mother had chosen to marry not my father but that Malay suitor she always proudly talked of. Hmmmm.

      Oh God ok this is the last one today, it's just too funny. The Onion -  urlLink CIA Asks Bush To Discontinue Blog .  In the interest of national security, President Bush has been asked to stop posting entries on his three-month-old personal web log, acting CIA director John E. McLaughlin said Monday.  According to McLaughlin, several recent entries on PrezGeorgeW. typepad.com have compromised military operations, while other posts may have seriously undercut the PR efforts of White House press secretary Scott McClellan.

       urlLink Would DPM Lee's new lineup include a woman?    In the last three years, there has not been one even at the minister of state level. And in the last 39 years, there was just one at Cabinet level, but only for a few brief months, and in an acting capacity at that.   But the slow march of women into the highest echelons of policy-making in Singapore may soon resume: Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is expected to include at least one woman when he announces his new line-up next week.   I would be rather irritated if DPM Lee chose to include a woman in his cabinet as a token gesture only to improve his image, to appease women voters or to encourage more women political involvement. To engage a woman's perspective? To draw talent from both sexes in our limited talent pool? Sure, all the reasons have been laid out now for including a woman, no man can cry 'no fair!" if/when a woman is chosen.   But it bothers me that one's gender is even such an important consideration. Let the best man/woman for the job do it, that's all I'd like to see. It seems rather biased in the first place, to assume that men can only see the male perspective or that a woman is necessary to bring in the female perspective. What *is* the female perspective on international affairs? Make love not war? And what are dominantly 'female issues'? Child care benefits? Bah.   I never considered myself much of a feminist. In retrospect, perhaps balking at the thought of a woman being sought only for her feminine mind, makes me more staunch of a feminist than I imagined.     This was interesting though:  Today  (the newspaper) asked several male MPs to comment on the issue, but all backed off, describing it as a "sensitive matter".   Am amused - why is it a "sensitive matter"? It is not a difficult question. What are you afraid of?

      The Onion, again -  urlLink an activist who took a break over summer .   University of Vermont junior Becca Davis failed to do anything for the people of Tibet during her summer vacation, disgruntled fellow activists reported Tuesday.  "With class out for the summer, Becca had a valuable window during which she could have pressured the Chinese government to end its tyrannical reign over the Tibetan people," campus activist Sally Coe said. "Instead, she sunbathed in the park and worked part-time at a local bookstore. As a result, the Tibetan freedom cause has been set back months."  Conquered by the People's Republic Of China in 1949, Tibet has suffered decades of political and religious oppression, and its leader, the Dalai Lama, has been exiled for 45 years. Tibetans who oppose the Chinese occupation have implored the world to intervene, but Davis has evidently decided to ignore their pleas.  If I ever became an activist, promise me I can still take a holiday sometimes. :D

      Interesting read on  urlLink one particular battle between the media and the government  in China.   I found this particular paragraph very intriguing:  Cheng said the party had given the press a mandate to monitor local officials. But he said he also picked his targets carefully. "In China, supervision by the media can only proceed within the existing system," he said.  "Freedom means knowing how big your cage is ."   (my emphasis.)  One might dream of breaking out of the cage, but that can probably happen only with a violent revolution that completely dismantles the current social and political structure. Fighting for a bigger cage, however, requires a different gameplan. Food for thought.

      Not terribly familiar with African affairs, but  urlLink this  seems dangerously similar to the Rwanda genocide, where international interference could have saved lives but we hesitated.    Tensions between Arabs and Africans competing for scarce natural resources in Darfur first surfaced during the 1970s. In February 2003, rebel groups of African Muslims, fed up with chronic inequalities between Africans and the ruling Arab elite (who are also Muslim), struck out against the Khartoum government. The government responded by arming local militias to crack down on mainly three ethnic groups -- the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa.  Now that the  urlLink UN has adopted a resolution on Sudan , it's at least a move towards pressuring the Sudanese government, albeit perhaps not a particularly effective one. Must continue to monitor the situation.

      I did a search for the article, because I happened to mention this to a friend. I brought it up in arguing that the fact that money has been granted does not necessary mean that the money can be spent in the most effective manner, because the US has required that  urlLink all drugs bought with the fund must be FDA approved .   Specified in the giant President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the restrictions against unapproved generics, which for now include all foreign-made generics, have added to the already long list of obstacles to bringing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to poor countries, experts attending the 15th International AIDS Conference here say.   "It was very confusing. You're trying to figure out who can buy what with what money," said Joia Mukherjee, medical director for Partners in Health, a Boston-based organization that has run an AIDS treatment program in Haiti for seven years and is developing others in Latin America.   The policy "slows the coordination" between the Bush plan and the people running treatment programs in the countries, Mukherjee said in an interview at the conference.  In defence of the plan, my friend argued, "But it is fair that they would like to ensure that the drugs are reliable and effective medication."   I find that very unconvincing. FDA is but a US agency. Suggesting that Americans live by higher standards would be rather presumptuous though probably not untrue. Still, I do not believe that FDA's standards and requirements should have to apply for citizens of the world. It reeks of condescending arrogance again, in the 'our way is the best way, and we are only trying to protect you' kind of way. In any case, Then what about what the WHO does? It's at least neutral and internationally accepted.   Most organizations that are providing money for AIDS drugs in those countries -- notably, the two-year-old Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- require that generics they purchase go through a process called pre-qualification that is run by the World Health Organization and is similar to FDA approval.  Whatever the rationale behind this requirement (I am fairly certain the fair bit of political pressure from the pharmaceutical giants in the US must have played a role in this), the result is the same - there is money, but it cannot be used to purchase cheap generics because they have not been FDA approved. This is not an insurmountable obstacle - sure, go ahead and get these drugs approved then. But it's frustrating, in a desperate and pressing race against time, against AIDS.

       urlLink Even the Channelnewsasia article mentions the 'jeering' or 'booing' .   It will be an intimidating atmosphere for Japan when they face China at the 65,000 capacity Workers' Stadium in Beijing on Saturday.  Japanese players have been heckled throughout the tournament by local crowds still incensed over Japan's World War II atrocities, and more of the same will likely be in store.  The incessant booing has become so bad that Japanese ministers and politicians complained Tuesday, calling on the Chinese government to take politics out of sport.  So the Asian Cup finale of China versus Japan is now set up amidst scalding hot emotions - not that I meant to suggest otherwise, but how might the government be able to 'take politics out of sports'? Or even if they could, why would they? It's not directly analogous, but remember that China is the country that engaged the US through ping pong... Where it could be a convenient tool whether for building bridges or for promoting nationalistic unity, what government would 'take politics out of sports'?   By the way, I watched the Japan vs Bahrain match. I must have screamed and jumped off my chair at least a few times. Ah soccer.

      Taking things a little far, are they not?  urlLink It's only soccer , people. Soccer fans are not known to be the most polite folks around, jeering is rather common, is it not?  Japan has lodged a protest with the Chinese government against Chinese fans jeering of the Japanese soccer team during the Asian Cup, a top government official said Wednesday.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda said that in late July Japanese diplomats in China asked the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chongqing Municipal Government to ensure local soccer fans did not jeer the Japanese team.  On Tuesday, Mitoji Yabunaka, head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Bureau, filed a protest with a top Chinese Embassy official here, according to Hosoda.  "We believe that anti-Japanese sentiment should not be encouraged. So we filed a complaint," said Hosoda. "We want China to act properly so that violence does not occur."  The 'violence'? Do I misunderstand the meaning of 'jeering' here or are they speaking of emotional damage to their poor Japanese soccer boys? Allow me to roll my eyes here.   Admittedly, most Chinese people dislike the Japanese. I was rather surprised when I heard young Chinese people I meet speak strongly against the Japanese government, I thought the hatred for the Japanese would faded significantly with the passing of the World War II generation. However, in truth, while their avoidance of guilty admission to atrocities during the war  is  one major issue the Chinese take with the Japanese, it's not simply that. Do not expect the Chinese to simply forget. Visit the Nanjing Massacre Memorial in Nanjing and you'd understand why it's so unforgettable.   However, as is the case with the supposed Arab 'hatred' for the Japanese, it's about the Japanese foreign policy more than it's about the people. The Chinese have nothing personal against the entire country of individuals. If you were a Japanese tourist in China on a 'sex tour', hell yeah you'd be one of the 'hated', yes. But a soccer player? Please, it's only sports.

      It is a scary thought, that such  urlLink irresponsible negligence is possible .     Kansai Electric Power Co. began shutting down all its operating nuclear reactors for safety checks after an accident that killed four workers in Japan's deadliest accident at a nuclear plant.  Kansai Electric, Japan's second largest power company, began the phased shutdown Friday as the government's nuclear safety agency started inspecting the scene of Monday's accident at a nuclear reactor in Mihama, 350 kilometres (220 miles) west of Tokyo.  Police are also investigating the company for possible negligence.  The four workers were killed and seven others were severely burned when non-radioactive steam blasted from a corroded water pipe that ruptured in a turbine room at the Mihama plant.   The company admitted afterwards that the ruptured pipe had not been properly checked for 28 years and the thickness of the walls had fallen below the legal minimum.   A series of such scandals has to cast serious doubt on Japanese corporate legal system, and as I had mentioned in the Mitsubishi scandal post, on the legitimacy of the assumption that public shame and brand name pride is enough to keep corporations in line to ensure consumer rights are protected. This accident, does not involve any actual radioactive leakage, but it could have.   A scary thought indeed.

       urlLink New Capital for Korea   South Korea announced on Wednesday that it had chosen an area in Yeongi and Gongju counties in the central South Chungcheong province as the site for its new capital.  The government wants to move the capital as Seoul and its surrounding Gyeonggi Province are densely populated. The new site is 160 kilometres south of Seoul.  "The Yeongi-Gongju area has been selected as the site for a new capital," Prime Minister Lee Hai-Chan said at a press conference broadcast live across the country.  Construction of the new capital, which has not yet been named, will begin in 2007 and key administrative agencies will start moving to it in 2012.  The first thought that came to my mind was, "Woah, some people are getting real estate windfalls from this." Haha.

      A common charge against US occupation of Iraq, was that it was a thinly veiled conspiracy for generating wealth for US companies. Exactly how much of Iraqi reconstruction funds are used to grant contracts to US firms had never been known,  urlLink till now.     For the first 14 months of the occupation, officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority provided little detailed information about the Iraqi money, from oil sales and other sources, that it spent on reconstruction contracts. They have said that it was used for the benefit of the Iraqi people and that most of the contracts paid from Iraqi money went to Iraqi companies. But the CPA never released information about specific contracts and the identities of companies that won them, citing security concerns, so it has been impossible to know whether these promises were kept.   The CPA has said it has awarded about 2,000 contracts with Iraqi money. Its inspector general compiled records for the major contracts, which it defined as those worth $5 million or more each. Analysis of those and other records shows that  19 of 37 major contracts funded by Iraqi money went to U.S. companies and at least 85 percent of the total $2.26 billion was obligated to U.S. companies.  The contracts that went to U.S. firms may be worth several hundred million more once the work is completed.   (my emphasis.)  Which means about at least USD 1.9 billion of funds go to US companies.   The article is long, but sheds light on issues with authorization of funds used, with Iraqi representation in deciding how the contracts are granted, and with commingling of US and Iraqi money to pay for tasks under a single contract.

      I always enjoyed the  urlLink Singapore National Day Parades . Propaganda-ish, yes sometimes. The best parts are usually not what the organizers have prepared though, but the overwhelming response from fellow spectators. Loud and confident singing of good ol' songs of the "We Are Singapore" era. Squeals of excitement from adult and child alike in response to the fireworks. Solemn and proud recitation of the Singapore pledge, faces painted red and white, enthusiastic clapping and cheering to the parachuters, etc.    This year is even more special though. I wish I could have gone - I would have joined in the cheering for PM Goh, I think I might even cry.
