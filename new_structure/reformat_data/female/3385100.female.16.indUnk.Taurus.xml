They are bit leery of organizations from "rich countries" as they put it.. who come in, do surgery and then leave a 3rd world country- often times practicing surgery rather than performing it. (This is very common with some medical groups- although they mean well. )  When they learned our organization returns to the same country for the past 16 years providing additional surgeries to the same patients and additional care, they realized we were seriously committed to our cause. Not only did they offer all their materials (I just have to get them translated and give them credit), they invited Dr. Clawson and myself to London for a gala event this September where ALL the European cleft palate and cleft lip organizations come together- including Spain (which would be a wonderful resource for us, as they speak Spanish...)  The meeting was more than I expected and I feel I made some wonderful friends! It was a truly a rewarding experience!  Looking forward getting back to you all, as its good to be home...... Jen some wonderful friends! It was a truly a rewarding experience!  Looking forward getting back to you all, as its good to be home...... Jen

      2004-03-28 9:25 p.m.  I juz realized that not a lot of pple blog everydayâ¦ And that means that itâs realli boring for meâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ Is everyoneâs blog so boring? Hmmâ¦ does anione think that my blog is boring? I wonderâ¦ Aniwae, lots of things happened to me todayâ¦ Went to my club at like 8+ this morningâ¦ I was in a rather good mood n jogged for about 4kmâ¦ Sighâ¦ got aching muscles nowâ¦ But I dun regretâ¦ Itâs like after jogging, u r too tired to thinkâ¦ n lately, I think I have been thinking a lot too muchâ¦ Like I sayâ¦ Sec4 is a realli stressful yearâ¦ After all that sweating thingy, I went to Sauna and Jacuzziâ¦ Quite a long time nv go alreadi so I couldnât with stand the heat n came out after like 30minâ¦Heheâ¦  Listening to a piano version of âchun zaiâ nowâ¦ I like it much better like thatâ¦ with out pple singingâ¦ Hahaâ¦ Ehâ¦ Went out with Cherylnn n Gerald in the afternoonâ¦ They had this English project thingy which required them to check out stuff on Singapore that happened on their birthdayâ¦ Itâs like a national thingy that every student has to doâ¦ I thinkâ¦ But Mrs. Tan nv ask us to do lehâ¦   Hmmâ¦ Lucky usâ¦ Ate at Bk for lunchâ¦ Was rather boringâ¦ Din know whyâ¦ Juz that nothing interesting lar...But lots of things have been going on in my mind latelyâ¦ Likeâ¦ Wad do I realli wanna be when I go up? Do I realli wanna juz waste my life away like that? If I dun, shouldnât I be doing something productive?   Then, wad exactly is productive? To me itâs to get out there in the society n start working to earn moneyâ¦ then I would be able to realize my dream (which is to earn big bucksâ¦) fasterâ¦ I know that many pple will probably think that I have realli wistful thinking as studying n learning stuff is realli impt. n all thatâ¦Iâm sorryâ¦ But I realli think that learning able stuff like Differentiation isnât gonna help in my future job unless I plan to be a Tcher or Chemist or Mathematicianâ¦ Which is far from wad I wanna beâ¦ Trust meâ¦  Right now, I m realli like having a case of identity crisisâ¦ To be honestâ¦ My one goal in life is not to âBe happyâ like most ppleâ¦ It is to live each day to the fullestâ¦ So that I will nv regretâ¦ I hate regrettingâ¦ Its juz one of the few things that I canât tolerateâ¦ And I can definitely assure u that if I were to die right nowâ¦ I would die with many regretsâ¦   Many pple ask meâ¦ Why m I like âShen Yinheâ in Westside Storyâ¦( For those of u who watch the show, u would probably know that she realli loves moneyâ¦) Well, let me tell u nowâ¦ perhaps it is not about truly loving moneyâ¦ But abt having a sense of securityâ¦ I may have a perfect family in ppleâs eyes but that doesnât mean that I m perfectly secureâ¦Think abt itâ¦ Pple say that money is not the most impt. thing in the worldâ¦ that there r much more impt. things that r worth moreâ¦ like loveâ¦ happinessâ¦ etc. I dun agreeâ¦ Call me practicalâ¦   But I know wad money can do to a person with a happy familyâ¦ Or a family that was once close could go to court over who gets more share of moneyâ¦ Money is a realli scary thingâ¦ And I rather control it than to have it control meâ¦ Pple tell me that money cannot buy anithingâ¦ Who says that? How much is pride worth? How much is a girlâs virginity worth? How much is happiness worth? I believe that with moneyâ¦ one can own the worldâ¦ one can have powerâ¦ one can have fameâ¦ one can have happinessâ¦ Although many pple tell me that money might not be able to help oneâs emotional self-beingâ¦  But if a poor artist has talent, wad he lacks is money to put up an exibit to let everyone be able to see his talentâ¦ isnât it? This guy who might have a poor self- esteem could well be a man of confidence the very next dayâ¦ Perhaps pple have different perspectiveâs in their livesâ¦ but I firmly take my standâ¦ At the very least, I know that if I had a million dollarsâ¦ I would be a much happier personâ¦While thatâs all for todayâ¦ Got lots of thoughts still n I juz canât seem to write anymoreâ¦  Quote: Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible and achieves the impossible.

      2004-03-27 9:51 p.m.  Today was a rather slow dayâ¦ but I liked itâ¦ First of all, we had the English comprehension test in the morningâ¦ It was about tarantulaâs etcâ¦ But it quite easyâ¦ I mean, I might not score like very high but I m quite sure I will do better than the last oneâ¦ which FYI is like 24/50â¦ failed by one markâ¦  After the test, we were supposed to have Flag Dayâ¦ But thanx to helping out to paint Street Soccer Court in our school, I had enough CIP hours alreadiâ¦ about 20+ n thatâs a lot, so I opted not to goâ¦   Instead, went out with Cherylnn from 4A n we went to eat Macâs for breakfastâ¦ I had hot cakes while she had Mcmuffin mealâ¦ It was rather nice talking to her larâ¦ I mean, I can relate to her n stuff n she is realli friendly n allâ¦ But, she is like seriously a Womenâs Rights kinda galâ¦ As in she is realli a true blue Feminist kinda galâ¦ Know wad I mean? I mean, I can relate n understand sometimes that guys r juz so total retards n should be abolished from the world etcâ¦ but then again, its juz sometimesâ¦  After breakfast we went to see her Skincare doctorâ¦ I mean, I know I m slow but I seriously din like realli realized that her skin condition has Realli realli improved a lot thanx to the medicine that the doctor gave to herâ¦ He is one helluva docter manâ¦ Cheryl introduced Cherylnn to him n one can realli see the before n after resultsâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I went home after that n slept for quite a while before waking up to do my workâ¦ Sounds like a slow n bboring day but it felt rather peaceful...  Ooooâ¦ I forgot to mention the âweirdâ n âcreepyâ phone call that I got in the afternoonâ¦ Hahaâ¦I was realli amused at allâ¦To be honest, I wasnât the least bit scaredâ¦ I mean, come onâ¦ It was so fakeâ¦The person was like so patheticâ¦He even like asked for me before he talked in that kind of rough, hoarse, and throaty voiceâ¦ I swear I tried to keep a straight face but I couldnât help itâ¦   Juz keep giggling n allâ¦ Obviously the person thought he was realli cool n all, speaking in that kind of alienly n retard languageâ¦ I realli felt true pity for a person wasting time to do thisâ¦ Wad do u expect? That I will be pertrified n scared out of my nerves? Oh pleaseâ¦ to that person who did it, Grow Upâ¦ I m sure your parents r ashamed by youâ¦  After the phone call, I tried to think of who would be that lame to do it n guess wad? The onli two pple I was thinking of was Yuen Hoi n Raynerâ¦ I know there was more possibilty on Yuen Hoi n all that but I did remember reading Cherylâs blog n seeing that when they were bored they played prank calls on ppleâ¦ So, Rayner if u guys r the ones that did it, I have serioulsy an advice for uâ¦ Dun be a Retardâ¦ There r too many pple in the world who r alreadi like that so stop acting like one to degrade yourselfâ¦=)  Another thing is I was thinking of changing relocating my blog from here to Blogspotâ¦ Itâs not bcoz lots of my other frens use blogspot but bcoz diarylandâs html stuff is realli very n I mean Very ma fanâ¦ as in troublsomeâ¦ Soâ¦ I guess, when I have the time, I will be shifting over to Blogspotâ¦ Pple who are reading this, pls look up for more updates to see when I will be relocatingâ¦=)  Quote:Every life has a story. And every story is a life.

I dunno wad to do nowâ¦ havenât talked to him in a while but he called me juz nowâ¦ I din ask him about the photo but he was realli glad that I m willing to talk to him n all thatâ¦ Wonder if I should be nice n juz forgive himâ¦  I know that I keep saying I forgive him alreadi but everytime I think of him n all thatâ¦ I juz think about wad happened (pls refer to previous entry) n even though in my heart I know I forgive him, I juz canât bring myself to realli like talk to him properlyâ¦ Haizâ¦ I dunno larâ¦ But juz now I talked to him, he wanted me to go out with him this Friday or Saturdayâ¦ I told him I had to check my scheduleâ¦ Heheâ¦ even though I had nothing on on both daysâ¦ make him think like I m realli unavailable kindâ¦ mean hor?=)  Oooâ¦ I forgot to sayâ¦ my mom is down with flu due to stressing too much over the Ah Bian matterâ¦ okie, maybe not real flu but she seems realli sick n lethagic larâ¦ Haizâ¦ Ah Bian can realli wreak havoc manâ¦ Btw, wad hw is there today? None I hopeâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Oh, n I m so PROUD of myselfâ¦ my layout for this blog had many changes that I wanted to make as the font of the words were either too big or too smallâ¦ n the colours of the background etc. is all changed by me!   The original template design which is shown at my layout... had rather weird background colours like purple for background n white wordsâ¦ Ewwâ¦ But I like the design n the picture of the princessâ¦ so I changed the rest all by myselfâ¦ cool huh~?  Why m I so proud of myself? Wellâ¦ considering I m a gal who knows absolutely nothing about HTMLâ¦ n all thatâ¦ I m rather surprised that I managed to figure out the weird codes n change the code colours n font size etc. Yea manâ¦ I rock! =P

      2004-03-16 7:04 pm  Today was juz another normal dayâ¦ Hmmmâ¦ but I went to watch Dirty Dancing 2 with Mabelâ¦ Oh manâ¦ it was such a great show it canât be anything betterâ¦ the dancing n moves were realli good tooâ¦ The bad part was the ending larâ¦ I canât stand it that the two main leads couldnât be tgtâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I like happy endingsâ¦ so if they could be tgt, the show would have been perfectâ¦ the funny thing was there were onli 5 pple in the entire cinemaâ¦ I realli wonder how they earn but I guess it was a little early as we watched at 12.45â¦ n it was at Century Squareâ¦ I like the seats there better then the Tampines Mall oneâ¦ Shaw Organization is much better Golden Villageâ¦ Oh, n the popcorn n stuffâ¦ I felt that it was realli cheapâ¦ Me n Mabel shared a popcorn n drink Large combo n it was like $5.50 split into twoâ¦thatâs like $2 plus eachâ¦ Whoaâ¦ Dirt cheapâ¦  The show was realli mostly about dancingâ¦ kinda like the Latinâ¦ Salsa kindâ¦ very sexy n very very sensualâ¦ I juz loved itâ¦ Hmmâ¦ maybe I should get someone to buy me the VCDâ¦ Yeaâ¦ Would love to watch the show againâ¦ It was definitely worth itâ¦ Unlike the cat in the hatâ¦ but luckily that show was a treat from yuen hoi or else I would have been so pissed, I wouldnât wanna go n watch this showâ¦ Heyâ¦ a girlâs gotta save marâ¦ heheâ¦ Oh manâ¦ now I canât stop thinking about the dance moves nowâ¦ realli very goodâ¦ Hmmâ¦ wish I had the time n money to take up dancing like thatâ¦ From young, I alwaize love dancing n grooving n singing n acting n all thatâ¦ I confessâ¦ I m a true-blue bathroom singerâ¦ heheâ¦ wadâs wrong with that? I think itâs realli coolâ¦ I m very sure Iâm not the onli person who sings in the bathroom in this worldâ¦ right?  Aniwae, I realli wish I had the money to enroll into such dance classesâ¦ oh well, maybe when I grow up thenâ¦ Sighâ¦ see? Money is such an impt. factorâ¦ If I had a huge load of money now, I would seriously cut classes n use the money to do wadever I wantâ¦ I mean, my parents r alwaize nagging at me to get good grades bcoz of moneyâ¦ They go like if I dun studyâ¦ I wun be able to do well in the future bcoz no one would want to hire me n I wun be able to live on my own blar blar n they dun want to still have to support me when they r oldâ¦ bcoz it should be the other way round but they know that with my meager âsalaryâ (if I m able to get a job that isâ¦)   I wun even have enough for myself so they juz hope that I can get good gradesâ¦ get an okie jobâ¦ earn abit of money n live with itâ¦ they dun expect me to support themâ¦ they juz dun want to support me anymoreâ¦(I bet lots of u r nodding your head to wad I say nowâ¦ to those who agreeâ¦ give me a five manâ¦ no, make that ten!)So, it all boils down to moneyâ¦ right? If I had the moneyâ¦ I can slash some of it somewhere n use the rest nowâ¦ to do stuff that I likeâ¦ so to meâ¦ money is real impt. n that is partly the reason why I love money so muchâ¦ to those who know me well would know that I love moneyâ¦ Well, there u have itâ¦ thatâs the reasonâ¦  Okieâ¦ I juz went to cook rice for dinner laterâ¦ I m so deadâ¦ promised to cook rice for mummy before she comes home n I forgotâ¦ hope she comes home later or else if she is back n the rice isnât ok, I m so deadâ¦Hurry up riceâ¦Okie, back to where I wasâ¦ eh, basically I juz wanna say I think Dirty Dancing was a great showâ¦ n I seemed to have crap this muchâ¦ haizâ¦ oh wellâ¦ waiting n waiting n waitingâ¦ rice, please hurry upâ¦ dun let me get scolded by mummyâ¦   YAY! Itâs done.. okie, mom coming back soonâ¦ think I better go nowâ¦ see ya tmrâ¦

      2004-03-15 9:09 p.m.  Sheeshâ¦ today is the 3rd day of holidaysâ¦ I know I should be studying n all that given my results as a sec4erâ¦ sighâ¦ Howeverâ¦ I must emphasize on the howeverâ¦hehe, I m here updating my blogâ¦ lousy day today tooâ¦I juz feel like I havenât really done anything fulfilling todayâ¦ like there is something I wanna doâ¦ to perk me up I guess? Okieâ¦ this is really hard to explain but if u understand than u doâ¦ if u dun den u dunâ¦right now my life is rather uneventfulâ¦ (Thank heavens)   I mean, hey no offense but if its supposed to be eventful, make it more easy for me to liveâ¦ not like a few weeks back where I keep losing my stuff n being extra ultra unluckyâ¦ sheeshâ¦ now that was bad!!! Realli BAD!   Aniwae, I was thinking of like making a planner to kinda like plan on wad I should study n do in the holidaysâ¦ However, see, I m emphasizing on the however againâ¦ I have to plan to write wad I should study in the planner n that takes brains n of coz, I m totally slacking here nowâ¦ so I m nowhere to finishing my plannerâ¦ sheeshâ¦ do u get wad I m saying? I m kinda lost with my words tooâ¦ dun worry I wun blame u if u call me weirdâ¦   Heyâ¦ itâs one of my middle namesâ¦ of coz the champion word is unpredictableâ¦ den cums weird n perhaps bimbotic n den bitchyâ¦ sheeshâ¦ all in all, its kinda taxing for pple who want to truly know me unless I give infoâ¦ so heyâ¦ look at my diaryâ¦ its supposed to portray ones inner ermâ¦ self right? Likeâ¦ inner being kinda thingâ¦ u get wad I mean? =) sure do hope soâ¦ oppsâ¦ digressingâ¦ Okie back to topic...  Sec 4â¦ haizâ¦ of coz itâs tiringâ¦ itâs the year when u feel more aliveâ¦ wanna party moreâ¦ like go outâ¦ have funâ¦ hang outâ¦ chill outâ¦ n wad r sec4s in Singapore supposed to do? STUDYâ¦ Arghhâ¦ the word itself is bad enoughâ¦ wad more having to plan to do itâ¦ sheeshâ¦ sometimes I wish I was in Legally Blondeâ¦ u know? The movie? Wellâ¦ being a bimbo sure aint that badâ¦ I mean, wad if u have the looksâ¦ juz go grab a rich guyâ¦ n your future is totally securedâ¦ hmmmâ¦ of coz itâs a plus if u fall in love with the guy or if the guy is a womanizer but heyâ¦ we r living in the 21st century right? Pple call us the Gen-Y ppleâ¦right? (I think) aniwaeâ¦if the man can womanize, why cant we go find a lover of our own? Sighâ¦ I can just betâ¦ the guy who womanizes is normalâ¦ juz bcoz he is richâ¦ n women? We r called whores... or slutsâ¦ so mean right? Bleahzâ¦ Oppsâ¦ digress againâ¦hehe back to the topicâ¦  As I was sayingâ¦ I think being a sec4 is realli tough n all thatâ¦ I kinda wish when I was back in sec3â¦ I think of my secondary yearsâ¦ sec3 was the bestâ¦ sec1 I was realli bitchyâ¦ sec2 wellâ¦ I mellowed down a lotâ¦ but was still very hmmâ¦ how do u explain it? See...? I was that badâ¦ I dun even know how to describe myselfâ¦ heheâ¦ Okieâ¦ thought of the wordâ¦ infamousâ¦ yeahâ¦ I was infamousâ¦ lots of pple knew meâ¦n it wasnât juz the pple in my same levelâ¦ it was realli pple from all levelsâ¦ I meanâ¦ now the sec4sâ¦ there are like 80% to 90% of pple knowing me but I dunno their namesâ¦ some of them r like acquaintancesâ¦ I alwaize say hi n bye to them but I dun even know their namesâ¦ sounds mean I know but heyâ¦ wad do u expect me to do? Go up to them n say for the past few years I have been saying hi n bye to u but I nv knew your name? Whoaâ¦ I think I will get slaughtered by them manâ¦ hahaâ¦   Howeverâ¦ lots of bad things happened during those yearsâ¦ n I have realli mellowed a lot through out the yearsâ¦ of course to say I regret my actions is not entirely true although I muz agree I could have handled a lot of situations differentlyâ¦   However, when I went to sec3, I grew up a lotâ¦ lots of things happenedâ¦ good things n badâ¦ BUT I muz say I realli enjoyed being a sec3â¦ wad with knowing new frensâ¦like Tafiqâ¦some of them even my best frens nowâ¦ such as Geraldâ¦ See Chingâ¦ Cherylâ¦ Sze Hweiâ¦ Yin Wenâ¦ Trinaâ¦ Mabelâ¦ etc. n although I had some clashes with Swee Fanâ¦ I certainly think of her as a very good fren nowâ¦ n I m realli glad to know herâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I treasure my frens a lot n hope that we will still keep in contact with each other foreverâ¦ smilez!=)  Sighâ¦ after juz looking through everything that I wroteâ¦ I feel so cheated of a lifeâ¦ Sec4 is realli a fun year bcoz guys finally matureâ¦ heheâ¦ u know wad I meanâ¦ itâs a lot nicer to talk to them in class nowâ¦ I mean in a frens way larâ¦ dun u go think of something elseâ¦ butâ¦ I guess Iâm realli stuck with studyingâ¦ sighâ¦ wadeva it isâ¦ I hope that I can survive through the whole entire process without losing any frens due to lost of contactâ¦ n of coz the ultimate goalâ¦ to get into Temesek polyâ¦!!!  Thatâs all folksâ¦ gtgâ¦ Till next timeâ¦cya!

      2004-03-01 8:19 p.m.  Okie... i know i should truely clarify lots of stuff with you...first of all...is it so weird to find out that i have another name and that it is Isabel? Well, i kinda like that name and to be honest cant stand my real name... so, thats something else you will know about me...=)  Another thing is well,as you know, i have a rather huge circle of frens... which i feel is a good n bad thing at the same time...i react realli diffentely when i m with different pple... let's see... when i m with my classmates, i m usually like the da jie thingy you know? n when i m with my clique in skool its like they treat me like a bimbo, so well, i feel more of being the 'xiao mei' among them...  You know wad i mean? Then with my other frens... its like, i m both at the same time...hmm...how to explain? its like, this is all me you know? I know it sounds weird, but even with different personalities, it's still me and i juz portray different sides of me at different time... i mean, i can be such a darn bitch n then such a stupid n blur bimbo... but, i guarentee that it is all me...not faking...  The other day Sze Hwei asked me about my 'other' frens... n it was like a life that my good frens such as ching,gerald,cheryl n of coz hwei dunno about... i do understand that feeling... it's like you have a good fren that has so another life... one that u seriosly dunno about... and have no idea about it... i thought about it n to be honest, i would feel interested too... i mean, who wouldn't n it feels weird right? But i realli wanna say that as much as i have a different life out there with my other frens, hwei n you all... r still my best frens ever...n i feel so glad that i know you all...   Hmm... except that i have something to complain about...is it just me or do i feel that sze ching has changed alot? It's like we dun even talk now... yep, i do sit her car to skool but its like we r strangers... dun have anithing to talk about n she alwaize gives me this buay song face like she is ultra pissed with me...hey, wad did i do man? tell me if i did something wrong right? i wun mind... i wanna change... i mean if it is a change for the better, hey why not? But of coz please give me time... i m not superwomen...   However, i sometimes kinda wonder...is bcoz of steven(her  bf)? Dun you get me wrong... i m so happi for them when i see them tgt...i alwaize feel tt there is tt love in the air... you know wad i mean? So, cool tt both of them r tgt but i cant help feeling tt bcoz of tt, we realli lost contact with her... everyday after skool she goes to find him...n she used to have this frens day n boyfren day during the week but now its all boyfren thing... okie... fine.. i know i sound like a jealous freak but who cares? i miss my fren.. is there abithing wrong with that?Bleahz...=P  Hmm... wad else is there that i wanted to say? Okie... i remebered... erm, i m SOooooooo going on a diet... Fat penguin... juz call me that... sigh... i cant help but growe fat right?Food RoX... n no fair... pple eat as much n i do n i seem to be the only one growing fatter n fatter n FaTTer... pleah... this totally sucks...  In any case...right now i m still thinking of stuff i need to clarify... other then yes i m mysterious bcoz i like to be...i feel that i wun ever show 100% of myself to anibody but different percents to different pple bcoz... if i do that would mean that i would get hurt easily bcoz i do let things get to even though i say i dun... cant help it... u got a sensitive gal here... so, to prevent getting hurt... i would realli do anithing...even if it means hurting others in the process... sorry... i believe that this is a surviaval world n this is just one of my survival tatics... so...well, too bad if u wanna know stuff about me... bcoz u wun be able to unless i allow myself to tell you that particular part of me...=)  Wad else is there? Questions anibody? Juz ask then... i love to answer the... so feel free to ask then...

      2004-03-28 9:25 p.m.  I juz realized that not a lot of pple blog everydayâ¦ And that means that itâs realli boring for meâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ Is everyoneâs blog so boring? Hmmâ¦ does anione think that my blog is boring? I wonderâ¦ Aniwae, lots of things happened to me todayâ¦ Went to my club at like 8+ this morningâ¦ I was in a rather good mood n jogged for about 4kmâ¦ Sighâ¦ got aching muscles nowâ¦ But I dun regretâ¦ Itâs like after jogging, u r too tired to thinkâ¦ n lately, I think I have been thinking a lot too muchâ¦ Like I sayâ¦ Sec4 is a realli stressful yearâ¦ After all that sweating thingy, I went to Sauna and Jacuzziâ¦ Quite a long time nv go alreadi so I couldnât with stand the heat n came out after like 30minâ¦Heheâ¦  Listening to a piano version of âchun zaiâ nowâ¦ I like it much better like thatâ¦ with out pple singingâ¦ Hahaâ¦ Ehâ¦ Went out with Cherylnn n Gerald in the afternoonâ¦ They had this English project thingy which required them to check out stuff on Singapore that happened on their birthdayâ¦ Itâs like a national thingy that every student has to doâ¦ I thinkâ¦ But Mrs. Tan nv ask us to do lehâ¦   Hmmâ¦ Lucky usâ¦ Ate at Bk for lunchâ¦ Was rather boringâ¦ Din know whyâ¦ Juz that nothing interesting lar...But lots of things have been going on in my mind latelyâ¦ Likeâ¦ Wad do I realli wanna be when I go up? Do I realli wanna juz waste my life away like that? If I dun, shouldnât I be doing something productive?   Then, wad exactly is productive? To me itâs to get out there in the society n start working to earn moneyâ¦ then I would be able to realize my dream (which is to earn big bucksâ¦) fasterâ¦ I know that many pple will probably think that I have realli wistful thinking as studying n learning stuff is realli impt. n all thatâ¦Iâm sorryâ¦ But I realli think that learning able stuff like Differentiation isnât gonna help in my future job unless I plan to be a Tcher or Chemist or Mathematicianâ¦ Which is far from wad I wanna beâ¦ Trust meâ¦  Right now, I m realli like having a case of identity crisisâ¦ To be honestâ¦ My one goal in life is not to âBe happyâ like most ppleâ¦ It is to live each day to the fullestâ¦ So that I will nv regretâ¦ I hate regrettingâ¦ Its juz one of the few things that I canât tolerateâ¦ And I can definitely assure u that if I were to die right nowâ¦ I would die with many regretsâ¦   Many pple ask meâ¦ Why m I like âShen Yinheâ in Westside Storyâ¦( For those of u who watch the show, u would probably know that she realli loves moneyâ¦) Well, let me tell u nowâ¦ perhaps it is not about truly loving moneyâ¦ But abt having a sense of securityâ¦ I may have a perfect family in ppleâs eyes but that doesnât mean that I m perfectly secureâ¦Think abt itâ¦ Pple say that money is not the most impt. thing in the worldâ¦ that there r much more impt. things that r worth moreâ¦ like loveâ¦ happinessâ¦ etc. I dun agreeâ¦ Call me practicalâ¦   But I know wad money can do to a person with a happy familyâ¦ Or a family that was once close could go to court over who gets more share of moneyâ¦ Money is a realli scary thingâ¦ And I rather control it than to have it control meâ¦ Pple tell me that money cannot buy anithingâ¦ Who says that? How much is pride worth? How much is a girlâs virginity worth? How much is happiness worth? I believe that with moneyâ¦ one can own the worldâ¦ one can have powerâ¦ one can have fameâ¦ one can have happinessâ¦ Although many pple tell me that money might not be able to help oneâs emotional self-beingâ¦  But if a poor artist has talent, wad he lacks is money to put up an exibit to let everyone be able to see his talentâ¦ isnât it? This guy who might have a poor self- esteem could well be a man of confidence the very next dayâ¦ Perhaps pple have different perspectiveâs in their livesâ¦ but I firmly take my standâ¦ At the very least, I know that if I had a million dollarsâ¦ I would be a much happier personâ¦While thatâs all for todayâ¦ Got lots of thoughts still n I juz canât seem to write anymoreâ¦  Quote: Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible and achieves the impossible.

      2004-03-27 9:51 p.m.  Today was a rather slow dayâ¦ but I liked itâ¦ First of all, we had the English comprehension test in the morningâ¦ It was about tarantulaâs etcâ¦ But it quite easyâ¦ I mean, I might not score like very high but I m quite sure I will do better than the last oneâ¦ which FYI is like 24/50â¦ failed by one markâ¦  After the test, we were supposed to have Flag Dayâ¦ But thanx to helping out to paint Street Soccer Court in our school, I had enough CIP hours alreadiâ¦ about 20+ n thatâs a lot, so I opted not to goâ¦   Instead, went out with Cherylnn from 4A n we went to eat Macâs for breakfastâ¦ I had hot cakes while she had Mcmuffin mealâ¦ It was rather nice talking to her larâ¦ I mean, I can relate to her n stuff n she is realli friendly n allâ¦ But, she is like seriously a Womenâs Rights kinda galâ¦ As in she is realli a true blue Feminist kinda galâ¦ Know wad I mean? I mean, I can relate n understand sometimes that guys r juz so total retards n should be abolished from the world etcâ¦ but then again, its juz sometimesâ¦  After breakfast we went to see her Skincare doctorâ¦ I mean, I know I m slow but I seriously din like realli realized that her skin condition has Realli realli improved a lot thanx to the medicine that the doctor gave to herâ¦ He is one helluva docter manâ¦ Cheryl introduced Cherylnn to him n one can realli see the before n after resultsâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I went home after that n slept for quite a while before waking up to do my workâ¦ Sounds like a slow n bboring day but it felt rather peaceful...  Ooooâ¦ I forgot to mention the âweirdâ n âcreepyâ phone call that I got in the afternoonâ¦ Hahaâ¦I was realli amused at allâ¦To be honest, I wasnât the least bit scaredâ¦ I mean, come onâ¦ It was so fakeâ¦The person was like so patheticâ¦He even like asked for me before he talked in that kind of rough, hoarse, and throaty voiceâ¦ I swear I tried to keep a straight face but I couldnât help itâ¦   Juz keep giggling n allâ¦ Obviously the person thought he was realli cool n all, speaking in that kind of alienly n retard languageâ¦ I realli felt true pity for a person wasting time to do thisâ¦ Wad do u expect? That I will be pertrified n scared out of my nerves? Oh pleaseâ¦ to that person who did it, Grow Upâ¦ I m sure your parents r ashamed by youâ¦  After the phone call, I tried to think of who would be that lame to do it n guess wad? The onli two pple I was thinking of was Yuen Hoi n Raynerâ¦ I know there was more possibilty on Yuen Hoi n all that but I did remember reading Cherylâs blog n seeing that when they were bored they played prank calls on ppleâ¦ So, Rayner if u guys r the ones that did it, I have serioulsy an advice for uâ¦ Dun be a Retardâ¦ There r too many pple in the world who r alreadi like that so stop acting like one to degrade yourselfâ¦=)  Another thing is I was thinking of changing relocating my blog from here to Blogspotâ¦ Itâs not bcoz lots of my other frens use blogspot but bcoz diarylandâs html stuff is realli very n I mean Very ma fanâ¦ as in troublsomeâ¦ Soâ¦ I guess, when I have the time, I will be shifting over to Blogspotâ¦ Pple who are reading this, pls look up for more updates to see when I will be relocatingâ¦=)  Quote:Every life has a story. And every story is a life.

I dunno wad to do nowâ¦ havenât talked to him in a while but he called me juz nowâ¦ I din ask him about the photo but he was realli glad that I m willing to talk to him n all thatâ¦ Wonder if I should be nice n juz forgive himâ¦  I know that I keep saying I forgive him alreadi but everytime I think of him n all thatâ¦ I juz think about wad happened (pls refer to previous entry) n even though in my heart I know I forgive him, I juz canât bring myself to realli like talk to him properlyâ¦ Haizâ¦ I dunno larâ¦ But juz now I talked to him, he wanted me to go out with him this Friday or Saturdayâ¦ I told him I had to check my scheduleâ¦ Heheâ¦ even though I had nothing on on both daysâ¦ make him think like I m realli unavailable kindâ¦ mean hor?=)  Oooâ¦ I forgot to sayâ¦ my mom is down with flu due to stressing too much over the Ah Bian matterâ¦ okie, maybe not real flu but she seems realli sick n lethagic larâ¦ Haizâ¦ Ah Bian can realli wreak havoc manâ¦ Btw, wad hw is there today? None I hopeâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Oh, n I m so PROUD of myselfâ¦ my layout for this blog had many changes that I wanted to make as the font of the words were either too big or too smallâ¦ n the colours of the background etc. is all changed by me!   The original template design which is shown at my layout... had rather weird background colours like purple for background n white wordsâ¦ Ewwâ¦ But I like the design n the picture of the princessâ¦ so I changed the rest all by myselfâ¦ cool huh~?  Why m I so proud of myself? Wellâ¦ considering I m a gal who knows absolutely nothing about HTMLâ¦ n all thatâ¦ I m rather surprised that I managed to figure out the weird codes n change the code colours n font size etc. Yea manâ¦ I rock! =P

Butâ¦ to be honest, I juz want to spent time with myselfâ¦ I want to be aloneâ¦ weird isnât it? Lots of pple in the world hates to be aloneâ¦ they feel lonelyâ¦ but to be honest, I like the feeling of being aloneâ¦ n I realli dun mind itâ¦   I know some pple who dun mind it but would prefer to be with company than to be aloneâ¦ but to me, I muz alwaize have this alone time with myselfâ¦ kinda like a special time I set aside for myselfâ¦ Yeaâ¦ being alone is totally ok with meâ¦ juz dun overdose me with itâ¦ heheâ¦ Itâs like a medicineâ¦ heals the wound that pple inflict on me or perhaps the wounds that r self-inflictedâ¦ I dunno but the alone time that I have? Alwaize makes me grow strongerâ¦=)  Hmmmâ¦ listening to BoAâs cd againâ¦ I realli like her song âSong with no nameâ n of coz âLove  Honestyââ¦ Yeaâ¦ I like the fast songs tooâ¦ but not realli in the mood nowâ¦ I dunno wadâs wrong with meâ¦ I havenât realli been in the mood for anything latelyâ¦ n I juz keep staying at home staring into spaceâ¦ sleepingâ¦ pigging outâ¦ watching Jap VCDâsâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ wad the hell is wrong with me?

      2004-03-18 1:04 p.m.  Hmmâ¦ I quarreled with Nicholas todayâ¦ againâ¦ Should I start with the entire story? Yep, I guess soâ¦ okie, here goes: We were kinda happy juz talking crap n making fun of each otherâ¦ then he wanted to make out n I was kinda agreeableâ¦ I mean, it was in the moodâ¦ but Hey, I m not the kinda of gal which wants to have a bf or juz go out with him with the intention of getting laid okâ¦ it was juz in the mood at the moment n I juz let him kiss meâ¦ but as things alwaize go, he was HOT, n I mean real hotâ¦ he realli advanced too fast n we were on his couch so he was realli rough with me n all thatâ¦ Sighâ¦ of coz I told him to stop n slow down etc. n of coz he dinâ¦ so I sorta pushed him on the floor n slapped himâ¦   Heyâ¦ itâs not my faultâ¦ I din wanna slap himâ¦ he din respect me, so wad can I do??? A galâs gotta protect herselfâ¦ or no one would help her even if she screams âHelp!ââ¦ itâs like a reflex actionâ¦ trust me galsâ¦ I learnt this the hard wayâ¦ but wait! Thereâs moreâ¦ Apparently, Nic was angryâ¦ n wad can I say? I mean, we r all mature adultsâ¦ Opps! For those who dunnoâ¦ Nicholas is currently my boyfriend or as other pple might say, steadâ¦ and while he is like the 4th guy in my life although I feel that for the rest of my exâ¦ we are not like couplesâ¦   I mean, including Nicholasâ¦ luckily he doesnât know I have a blog or else I swear he would strangle meâ¦heheâ¦ Aniwae, back to where I was, I alwaize treat this guyâs in my life abit more den my normal guy frens but never like totally past the frensâs lineâ¦ itâs sorta like past the frens line but never towards the boyfren lineâ¦ itâs like more than a fren but no more then a boyfrenâ¦ u get wad I mean? Sheeshâ¦ nvmâ¦ If u get it, u do but if u dun then u dunâ¦ thereâs no point explainingâ¦  So, back to wad happenedâ¦ He was angry of courseâ¦ that I slapped him n all that n guess wad he told me? He called me a slut n whore n said that itâs not the first time I serviced a guyâ¦ n y should I stop him from continuing etcâ¦ Whoaâ¦ after listening to him, I got so pissedâ¦ I was fuming madâ¦ n trust me, u wun wanna cross my paths when I m angryâ¦ I mean, Helloâ¦ thatâs sorta like a common knowledgeâ¦ n I kinda juz stared him downâ¦ but I bet if u were there, u would be able to see the fire burning in my eyesâ¦ n dun mistake it as passion, bcoz it most certainly is notâ¦ so, guess wad I did other then stare him down?   NOTHINGâ¦ hahaâ¦ u should have been thereâ¦ he was shocked n embarrassed n realli like din know wad to doâ¦ but I juz leftâ¦ I walked out of his room n house juz like thatâ¦ Cool huh~? Yeaâ¦ n Isabel strikesâ¦ n she Scores!!!   Now? Heâs been calling me for the past few hours so I hung up the phoneâ¦=) Hmmâ¦ apparently I think he heard that I was realli open from my frens n perhaps he thought that I did it with my exâ¦ the 3rd guyâ¦ Derrickâ¦ but hey, Derrick is such a gentlemanâ¦ he wun force anything on me not like Nicholasâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ thinking of it now juz makes me in a ultra bad moodâ¦ Sorryâ¦ thatâs why I din write in my blog yesterdayâ¦ but I wun careâ¦ y should I let this scum bother me n affect my life?   To be honest, I m glad he is begging me nowâ¦ the feeling is realli greatâ¦ hahaâ¦ n well, of coz I wun break up with him due to such small reasonsâ¦ y give him a reason to hate me? When I realli break-up with himâ¦ I would do it in such a way that it totally breaks his heartâ¦ in such a way that he will nv forget me for the rest of his lifeâ¦I want him to feel sorta like âshen bu ru siââ¦ how do u say that in English? Ehâ¦ I dunnoâ¦ go ask someone if u dun understand wad I m sayingâ¦  Heheâ¦ so right now, I m still deciding on when I should forgive Nicholasâ¦ soon I thinkâ¦ how about tomorrow? Okieâ¦ tomorrow is a good dayâ¦ well, I gtg nowâ¦ cya laterâ¦

      2004-03-16 7:04 pm  Today was juz another normal dayâ¦ Hmmmâ¦ but I went to watch Dirty Dancing 2 with Mabelâ¦ Oh manâ¦ it was such a great show it canât be anything betterâ¦ the dancing n moves were realli good tooâ¦ The bad part was the ending larâ¦ I canât stand it that the two main leads couldnât be tgtâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I like happy endingsâ¦ so if they could be tgt, the show would have been perfectâ¦ the funny thing was there were onli 5 pple in the entire cinemaâ¦ I realli wonder how they earn but I guess it was a little early as we watched at 12.45â¦ n it was at Century Squareâ¦ I like the seats there better then the Tampines Mall oneâ¦ Shaw Organization is much better Golden Villageâ¦ Oh, n the popcorn n stuffâ¦ I felt that it was realli cheapâ¦ Me n Mabel shared a popcorn n drink Large combo n it was like $5.50 split into twoâ¦thatâs like $2 plus eachâ¦ Whoaâ¦ Dirt cheapâ¦  The show was realli mostly about dancingâ¦ kinda like the Latinâ¦ Salsa kindâ¦ very sexy n very very sensualâ¦ I juz loved itâ¦ Hmmâ¦ maybe I should get someone to buy me the VCDâ¦ Yeaâ¦ Would love to watch the show againâ¦ It was definitely worth itâ¦ Unlike the cat in the hatâ¦ but luckily that show was a treat from yuen hoi or else I would have been so pissed, I wouldnât wanna go n watch this showâ¦ Heyâ¦ a girlâs gotta save marâ¦ heheâ¦ Oh manâ¦ now I canât stop thinking about the dance moves nowâ¦ realli very goodâ¦ Hmmâ¦ wish I had the time n money to take up dancing like thatâ¦ From young, I alwaize love dancing n grooving n singing n acting n all thatâ¦ I confessâ¦ I m a true-blue bathroom singerâ¦ heheâ¦ wadâs wrong with that? I think itâs realli coolâ¦ I m very sure Iâm not the onli person who sings in the bathroom in this worldâ¦ right?  Aniwae, I realli wish I had the money to enroll into such dance classesâ¦ oh well, maybe when I grow up thenâ¦ Sighâ¦ see? Money is such an impt. factorâ¦ If I had a huge load of money now, I would seriously cut classes n use the money to do wadever I wantâ¦ I mean, my parents r alwaize nagging at me to get good grades bcoz of moneyâ¦ They go like if I dun studyâ¦ I wun be able to do well in the future bcoz no one would want to hire me n I wun be able to live on my own blar blar n they dun want to still have to support me when they r oldâ¦ bcoz it should be the other way round but they know that with my meager âsalaryâ (if I m able to get a job that isâ¦)   I wun even have enough for myself so they juz hope that I can get good gradesâ¦ get an okie jobâ¦ earn abit of money n live with itâ¦ they dun expect me to support themâ¦ they juz dun want to support me anymoreâ¦(I bet lots of u r nodding your head to wad I say nowâ¦ to those who agreeâ¦ give me a five manâ¦ no, make that ten!)So, it all boils down to moneyâ¦ right? If I had the moneyâ¦ I can slash some of it somewhere n use the rest nowâ¦ to do stuff that I likeâ¦ so to meâ¦ money is real impt. n that is partly the reason why I love money so muchâ¦ to those who know me well would know that I love moneyâ¦ Well, there u have itâ¦ thatâs the reasonâ¦  Okieâ¦ I juz went to cook rice for dinner laterâ¦ I m so deadâ¦ promised to cook rice for mummy before she comes home n I forgotâ¦ hope she comes home later or else if she is back n the rice isnât ok, I m so deadâ¦Hurry up riceâ¦Okie, back to where I wasâ¦ eh, basically I juz wanna say I think Dirty Dancing was a great showâ¦ n I seemed to have crap this muchâ¦ haizâ¦ oh wellâ¦ waiting n waiting n waitingâ¦ rice, please hurry upâ¦ dun let me get scolded by mummyâ¦   YAY! Itâs done.. okie, mom coming back soonâ¦ think I better go nowâ¦ see ya tmrâ¦

Okieâ¦ this is really hard to explain but if u understand than u doâ¦ if u dun den u dunâ¦right now my life is rather uneventfulâ¦ (Thank heavens)   I mean, hey no offense but if its supposed to be eventful, make it more easy for me to liveâ¦ not like a few weeks back where I keep losing my stuff n being extra ultra unluckyâ¦ sheeshâ¦ now that was bad!!! Realli BAD!   Aniwae, I was thinking of like making a planner to kinda like plan on wad I should study n do in the holidaysâ¦ However, see, I m emphasizing on the however againâ¦ I have to plan to write wad I should study in the planner n that takes brains n of coz, I m totally slacking here nowâ¦ so I m nowhere to finishing my plannerâ¦ sheeshâ¦ do u get wad I m saying? I m kinda lost with my words tooâ¦ dun worry I wun blame u if u call me weirdâ¦   Heyâ¦ itâs one of my middle namesâ¦ of coz the champion word is unpredictableâ¦ den cums weird n perhaps bimbotic n den bitchyâ¦ sheeshâ¦ all in all, its kinda taxing for pple who want to truly know me unless I give infoâ¦ so heyâ¦ look at my diaryâ¦ its supposed to portray ones inner ermâ¦ self right? Likeâ¦ inner being kinda thingâ¦ u get wad I mean? =) sure do hope soâ¦ oppsâ¦ digressingâ¦ Okie back to topic...  Sec 4â¦ haizâ¦ of coz itâs tiringâ¦ itâs the year when u feel more aliveâ¦ wanna party moreâ¦ like go outâ¦ have funâ¦ hang outâ¦ chill outâ¦ n wad r sec4s in Singapore supposed to do? STUDYâ¦ Arghhâ¦ the word itself is bad enoughâ¦ wad more having to plan to do itâ¦ sheeshâ¦ sometimes I wish I was in Legally Blondeâ¦ u know? The movie? Wellâ¦ being a bimbo sure aint that badâ¦ I mean, wad if u have the looksâ¦ juz go grab a rich guyâ¦ n your future is totally securedâ¦ hmmmâ¦ of coz itâs a plus if u fall in love with the guy or if the guy is a womanizer but heyâ¦ we r living in the 21st century right? Pple call us the Gen-Y ppleâ¦right? (I think) aniwaeâ¦if the man can womanize, why cant we go find a lover of our own? Sighâ¦ I can just betâ¦ the guy who womanizes is normalâ¦ juz bcoz he is richâ¦ n women? We r called whores... or slutsâ¦ so mean right? Bleahzâ¦ Oppsâ¦ digress againâ¦hehe back to the topicâ¦  As I was sayingâ¦ I think being a sec4 is realli tough n all thatâ¦ I kinda wish when I was back in sec3â¦ I think of my secondary yearsâ¦ sec3 was the bestâ¦ sec1 I was realli bitchyâ¦ sec2 wellâ¦ I mellowed down a lotâ¦ but was still very hmmâ¦ how do u explain it? See...? I was that badâ¦ I dun even know how to describe myselfâ¦ heheâ¦ Okieâ¦ thought of the wordâ¦ infamousâ¦ yeahâ¦ I was infamousâ¦ lots of pple knew meâ¦n it wasnât juz the pple in my same levelâ¦ it was realli pple from all levelsâ¦ I meanâ¦ now the sec4sâ¦ there are like 80% to 90% of pple knowing me but I dunno their namesâ¦ some of them r like acquaintancesâ¦ I alwaize say hi n bye to them but I dun even know their namesâ¦ sounds mean I know but heyâ¦ wad do u expect me to do? Go up to them n say for the past few years I have been saying hi n bye to u but I nv knew your name? Whoaâ¦ I think I will get slaughtered by them manâ¦ hahaâ¦   Howeverâ¦ lots of bad things happened during those yearsâ¦ n I have realli mellowed a lot through out the yearsâ¦ of course to say I regret my actions is not entirely true although I muz agree I could have handled a lot of situations differentlyâ¦   However, when I went to sec3, I grew up a lotâ¦ lots of things happenedâ¦ good things n badâ¦ BUT I muz say I realli enjoyed being a sec3â¦ wad with knowing new frensâ¦like Tafiqâ¦some of them even my best frens nowâ¦ such as Geraldâ¦ See Chingâ¦ Cherylâ¦ Sze Hweiâ¦ Yin Wenâ¦ Trinaâ¦ Mabelâ¦ etc. n although I had some clashes with Swee Fanâ¦ I certainly think of her as a very good fren nowâ¦ n I m realli glad to know herâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I treasure my frens a lot n hope that we will still keep in contact with each other foreverâ¦ smilez!=)  Sighâ¦ after juz looking through everything that I wroteâ¦ I feel so cheated of a lifeâ¦ Sec4 is realli a fun year bcoz guys finally matureâ¦ heheâ¦ u know wad I meanâ¦ itâs a lot nicer to talk to them in class nowâ¦ I mean in a frens way larâ¦ dun u go think of something elseâ¦ butâ¦ I guess Iâm realli stuck with studyingâ¦ sighâ¦ wadeva it isâ¦ I hope that I can survive through the whole entire process without losing any frens due to lost of contactâ¦ n of coz the ultimate goalâ¦ to get into Temesek polyâ¦!!!  Thatâs all folksâ¦ gtgâ¦ Till next timeâ¦cya!

      2004-01-16 10:57 p.m.  Okieâ¦ I m cranky n veri veri depressedâ¦ I think I m suffering from a mild case of depressionâ¦ Had a slight quarrel with my momâ¦ I wun bother u with the details as they arenât veri pleasant, but right now, I m not talking to her unless she talks to meâ¦   N I will onli answer her questionsâ¦ Other than that, I dun give a damn abt her n will juz give her an impassive face whenever I see herâ¦ Bleahâ¦ Mothers sux!!! It is of coz no wonder that I dun wanna bcom a mother with I grow upâ¦(those who are familiar with this will know wad I meanâ¦)  I juz bathed finish juz nowâ¦ standing under the shower n feeling the water rush down my body was greatâ¦ It felt totally cleansing n the water juz washed awae all my fatigueâ¦ If onli life can like thatâ¦ A rain or downpour that rinses down your body n takes awae all the pain n sadness u experienceâ¦ Oh well, wishes will onli be wishesâ¦ they can nv come throughâ¦  This few days have juz proven the extent of my âdepressedâ moodâ¦ I have been snapping at some of my frens n being realli meanâ¦ Sorrie to those who have to put up with my cranky attitudeâ¦ I truly din mean all the bad stuff I sayâ¦   Like I say, the breaking up thingy has realli taken a toll on meâ¦ Right now, I juz wanna hurry up n get over itâ¦ The exams r oso nearing n they r realli stressing me outâ¦ I juz listed my studying schedule for this weekend n I realised that it is kinda stupefyingâ¦ Meaning that it is kinda crazyâ¦ I m mad enough to stuff lots of studying into 2 daysâ¦ I m crap.  Watching Survivor as I type nowâ¦ Oh manâ¦ those pple r so poor thingsâ¦ Missing their families n all thatâ¦ Sighâ¦ Ok, commercial breakâ¦ I m typing as fast as I can nowâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Nothing happened much todae in schoolâ¦ Chem was pretty Duh~ as usual, but I m rather surprised that she din pick on me like I thot she wouldâ¦ However, her grouchy face was still there as usualâ¦ Sometimes I realli wonder if she went through plastic surgery to make her face look naturally Chao Bin all the timeâ¦ Hmmâ¦  Oooâ¦ I juz rememberedâ¦ I went for SSS the first time todaeâ¦ Amazing!!! Even Mr Chan was shocked to see meâ¦ Heheâ¦ So proud of myselfâ¦ Now I m pondering over whether I should go tmr or notâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Well, I guess I will have to goâ¦ I left my emaths tb n S.S tb in my lockerâ¦ Coz I missed out on the S.S test yday, I have to retake the test on Mondayâ¦ Shucksâ¦ Darn itâ¦  As I came home todae, I counted the no. of lights on top of the shelter that leads from the bus-stop to the void deck of my houseâ¦ 37â¦ Weird number huh~? I know I knowâ¦ pple reading this will probably be thinking of how bo liao I mâ¦ But I realli wonderâ¦ Having to walk that walkway everydayâ¦ n yet I truly doubt that the hundreds of pple who walk through it everyday  know how many lights light up the walkwayâ¦  I know that it sounds cornyâ¦ But its not realli abt counting how many lights etc. But more abt the things in lifeâ¦ How many times have we as humans look past the impt. things in life? Whether it is bcoz of searching for fameâ¦moneyâ¦or juz bcoz of the stress that we face in every moment of our lives, we seem to forget that besides that, there r still more impt. things in lifeâ¦ N perhaps we should take some time out everyday or every weekâ¦ To look back at how wonderful life can be at timesâ¦ How we juz overlook the little things that we used to treasure in lifeâ¦  I will juz leave u with that thought nowâ¦ Be back tmrâ¦  Quote: Life is eternal and love is immortal. Death is only a horizon. And a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight.

      2004-01-15 2:23 p.m.  Given my condition todae, I m so lucky that I din go to schoolâ¦ I cant talkâ¦ I m sot tired bcoz the medicine the docter has given me keeps making me drowsy, n I cant even hold a pen upright without my hand shakingâ¦ This is how bad it gets but the bad thing is the MC onli lasts for one dayâ¦ So no matter wad, I have to go back to school tmrâ¦ I hope I get better by thenâ¦  Nothing much happened todayâ¦ Nicholas came over my house to fuss over meâ¦ Although I feel totally weird out with him fussing over me since there is nothing to fuss abt coz I m practically asleep the whole timeâ¦ The docter says I cant eat ani heaty foodâ¦ Which onli leaves room for light porridge n so onâ¦ Sighâ¦ How poor thing can I get? Freaking hungry nowâ¦ I hate antibioticsâ¦ Makes u wanna eatâ¦ Sheeshâ¦  Hmmâ¦ Hope I dun miss too much at school todayâ¦Given the present status which is that mid-yrs r looming around us I cant afford to waste animore timeâ¦ M quite angry with myself for letting this cranky sickness overcome meâ¦ I was desperately trying to study juz now but I realli couldnât help it n juz fell asleepâ¦ Oh manâ¦ This sux!!!  I realised that my life has been getting more n more boring latelyâ¦ I have truly nothing interesting to write abt n I juz keep crapping abt being sick etc. Sighâ¦ Perhaps I should stop blogging alreadiâ¦ its no point to nowâ¦  Quote: The cure for boredom is curiosity.

Oh sighâ¦ the wonders of gossipâ¦ Well, wad can I say? I mean, I do have to bear the fact that I m sorta doing him wrong by not having a good reason to break-up with himâ¦ I juz wish he wouldnât be so niceâ¦ So I could at least find so fault with him n give him a better reason for our break-upâ¦  So now I m currently labelled as the cruel heartless bitch bcoz nicholas has been so nice n all thatâ¦ Haizâ¦ Someoneâ¦ I desperately need adviceâ¦ Juz wad should I do???

Oh manâ¦  There will be no quote todaeâ¦ canât thinkâ¦sorrie.  P.S From now onâ¦ I will unlock my blogâ¦ nothing more to keep from anioneâ¦

      2004-01-12 9:53 p.m.  Okieâ¦ Nothing much happened to me todae, but I gotta make some announcementsâ¦ First of all, as some of u might knowâ¦ I m intending to break up with Nicholas soonâ¦ Pls do not try n change my mindâ¦ A galâs gotta be strong so as not to get hurtâ¦ Besides, I totally do not wanna lead him on when my love for him is non-existing compared to wad he feels for meâ¦   I do not wish to repeat my mistake againâ¦ Like Derrickâ¦ I donât wanna hurt another person that badly animoreâ¦ There is enough guilt in my conscience alreadiâ¦ I dun wanna add more to itâ¦ For those who knowâ¦ Isabel  Derrickâ¦ the legendary coupleâ¦ n the bitch who broke his heartâ¦ who else but meâ¦ Okieâ¦ enough abt thatâ¦ I totally dun wanna revisit the pain I inflicted on myself n himâ¦  So, like I sayâ¦ Will definitely have to pick out a date to which I have to do stuff that juz labels me as a total heartless galâ¦ Butâ¦ I will still be courteous enough to tell it in his face n not through the handphone or internet or email etc. I find those ways totally cowardlyâ¦ I mean, since I m the one who is going to dump him, den I wanna face up to all his scoldings/rantings/dressins-downsâ¦ At the very least, I suppose that I should be there in front of him so that he can look at me n yell all he wantsâ¦ I feel that in a wayâ¦he is entitled to thatâ¦  Sighâ¦ ok, enough abt all thatâ¦ Another thing that I gotta say is that I wun be updating my blog everyday animoreâ¦ As u all know, mid-yrs r comingâ¦ I m not gonna be in front of the com all the time alreadiâ¦ This is not goodâ¦ I juz keep spending my time onlineâ¦ no time at all to studyâ¦ Oh well, thatâs abt all I guessâ¦  M in a very bad mood nowâ¦ Haizâ¦ I feel very badâ¦ having to dump someoneâ¦ this is like the 4th timeâ¦ N I canât help but think of Derrick all the time nowâ¦ How much I hate himâ¦ Wad I made him do indirectlyâ¦ How I wish I can change the pastâ¦ But things nv change do they? Regretâ¦ It consumes your soulâ¦ intrigues uâ¦ pulls youâ¦ n u fall and wallow in guiltâ¦ And slowly, it sucks the life force out of youâ¦Till one day you canât breatheâ¦ You canât breathe without thinking of wad you have doneâ¦ And it lingersâ¦ on n onâ¦  Quote: It's hard to face reality when reality has many faces.   **One of my favourite quotesâ¦**

      2004-01-11 9:42 p.m.  Sheeshâ¦ havenât done the zhuo wen which I m supposed to doâ¦ Oh darnâ¦ Now I m watching the NKF thingy n blogging at the same timeâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Aniwae, todae was quite interestingâ¦   First of all, we were all at Rachaelâs houseâ¦ Her house is that kind ermâ¦ how do u call it? Terrace? Yeaâ¦ I think soâ¦ Aniwae, there was this kinda like gathering over there n i was there tooâ¦ Me n Steph n Rachael n some other ppleâ¦ frens n all larâ¦ Well, wad happened was there was this gal called Annie n she was so stickyâ¦ someone whom I will call a slugâ¦ like super glueâ¦ we specially went to Rachâs room for more privacy n all thatâ¦ n she was like tagging along with us n commenting on every sentence that we were saying even though she din have much idea on wad it wasâ¦ Have u ever have this kind of experience? Well, if u do, u will know wad I meanâ¦ Pleahâ¦ I was practically rolling my eyes the whole timeâ¦I will now tell u part of wad happened. The conversation goes like this:  Steph: My Dad is gonna get a new carâ¦ Rach  me: Realli? Annie: Yarâ¦ I think your Dad needs a new car aniwaeâ¦The one he has now is not nice Me: *Roll eyes* Me: Ermâ¦ Steph arâ¦ So did u get scolded when your dad saw the bill of your cashcard? Annie: Aiyaâ¦ Steph is so richâ¦ so wad if she spends a little more?Its ok oneâ¦ I doubt her parents will say anithing right? Rach: Ehâ¦ Iz, did Nick manage to get the day off next week? Annie: Iz, he is so busy all the timeâ¦ u better watch out, he might be having another gal somewhereâ¦  Okieâ¦ now that realli pissed me offâ¦ I think some of u might have encountered this kind of pple right? Sighâ¦ So irritating!!! I realli couldnât stop rolling my eyesâ¦ Duh~ Who does she think she is? Miss-know-it-all??? Oh wellâ¦ nvm abt herâ¦ I totally canât be bothered animoreâ¦  Okie, so after that, we had sort of like some refreshments which Rachâs Dad kindly providedâ¦ although he was oblivious to the fact that the fruit punch was âspikedâ with champagneâ¦ Heheâ¦ Courtesy of Stephâs boyfrenâ¦  Then as we were all rather bored, we decided to play Spin the Bottleâ¦ Hmmâ¦ n I was so DARN Unlucky to get chosen by someoneâ¦ I will be nice n wun mention his nameâ¦ But I still m gonna comment on his kissing methodâ¦ Or rather his lack of oneâ¦ It was practically like Exchanging Spit with someone elseâ¦ Of all the pple I have kissed even though some may have been bad, it couldnât beat this! It was SO badâ¦ His wet n clammy tongueâ¦ Ewwâ¦ So vulgarâ¦ like this disgusting filthy thing invading my mouthâ¦ Bleahâ¦ I bet this is totally the main reason he doesnât have a girlfrendâ¦ Oh manâ¦ GHASTLYâ¦REVOLTINGâ¦ REPULSIVE!!!  Okieâ¦ Thatâs abt the general idea of my âinterestingâ life todayâ¦ Btw, the quote I m writing today totally depicts wad I m feeling nowâ¦  Quote: Most men do not mature, they simply grow taller.

      2004-01-09 9:34 p.m.  Abt me saying that I m totally sianed today? Scratch thatâ¦ Delete itâ¦ Thrash it! Hehe, it was in fact a rather eventful day for meâ¦ although it was onli for a few hoursâ¦  First of all, I managed to find someone who was free to go out with me in the afternoonâ¦ My dearest xiao xiao mei (lai bao)â¦ Hehe, so we agreed to go to Bugis to eat n take Neoprintsâ¦ I missed her so muchâ¦ Had a great time with her, talking abt stuff n all thatâ¦ I felt that the trip was realli worthwhile n meaningfulâ¦ We talked abt lots of stuff larâ¦ Heheâ¦ Which of coz I canât mention out hereâ¦ Oh, n since I was like dead hungry (due to the fact that I havenât eaten as I couldnât find anione who was free to go out n havelunch with me until 3+) coz it was like 4+ alreadi n I thot that my stomach would juz start to digest itself, we hurried to a place to eatâ¦ Going up the escalator, I saw the signboard of Yoshinoya n decided to eat thereâ¦  The place was rather crowded but luckily we managed to find a place to sit down n eatâ¦ I ordered this Beef n Teriyaki combo mealâ¦ n a ice lemon teaâ¦ It was quite fillingâ¦ Liked it a lotâ¦ So, we sat down n talked for a while, n she was like asking me quite a lot of questionsâ¦ but I had fun answering them larâ¦=)  So here comes to the fun partâ¦ We were sort of like shopping around n all thatâ¦ Juz walking around, n I realised that there was lots of AHS pple thereâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Aniwae, after walking aimlessly around for a while, we decided to hurry go take the neoprintsâ¦ There was somewhat a long queue but we juz stood there n talked somemore till it was our turn to the machineâ¦ Havenât taken neoprints in a whileâ¦ I felt that the pictures that came out was realli sucessful n all thatâ¦ Oh man, juz canât help staring at my ownself in the neoprintâ¦ I think I m falling in love with myselfâ¦ Oh noâ¦ That is so NOT goodâ¦  Hahaâ¦ But it was realli nice n all thatâ¦ The designs n patterns that we added was realli niceâ¦ Oh manâ¦ I juz love the pictureâ¦ =P heheâ¦ See? I m getting too self-obsessedâ¦ Darnâ¦  Okie, so after taking the neoprints, we wanted to sorta like sit down n perhaps have a small dessert that kind while we continue to discuss abt some stuffâ¦ But guess wad? All the sorta like restaurants were all fullâ¦ N so, we went back down to the basement n back to Yoshinoyaâ¦ Which, thank God was not fullâ¦ After eating the meal juz now (which was a lot), I m surprised that I was juz like moderately fullâ¦ So, I kinda like ordered another mealâ¦ The Beef value meal was delicious, but to be honest, after eating it, I was so full, I nearly felt like puking it all out againâ¦ Sighâ¦ It nv pays to be a glutton!!!  Went home after all thatâ¦ Heheâ¦ Now I m still looking at that neoprintâ¦ We realli look great in itâ¦ Oh manâ¦ I knowâ¦ I should juz Shut Upâ¦ Heheâ¦  Quote: Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.

      2004-01-08 8:51 p.m.  I m like almost fine now except for a slight headacheâ¦ Sigh, heard from Yin wen that I m in deep soup for skipping like 4 SSSâ¦ Not I wanna skip all the time okâ¦ the first 2 times, I got something onâ¦ that was like the first Friday n Saturdayâ¦ Den later, last week, was sick on Friday marâ¦ Went to school on Saturday onli to take the Bio testâ¦ So, I din go for the SSS on last Saturday tooâ¦ Now I got to present excuse letters n probably get into trouble with lots of ppleâ¦  I m So unluckyâ¦ Dunno wadâs wrong larâ¦ But, the next time I m sick, I will juz go to school n sleep in classâ¦ at least, I got goâ¦ wun get into trouble that wayâ¦ Lousy day larâ¦ Nick not free to pei~ meâ¦ Sighâ¦ Aniwae, somebody changed my blogâs pwâ¦ I canât say who, but I so wanna kill himâ¦ Den play with my blog larâ¦ Jerk! Hahaâ¦ But its alright nowâ¦ took revenge by puncturing out his motorcycleâs tiresâ¦ Now he has got a flat tireâ¦ Heheâ¦ I know I m So mean...=P  Daddyâs coming home todayâ¦ Yayâ¦ Surprisingly I miss himâ¦ I know he realli wants me to do well in the Oâs this yearâ¦ Have been saying like I muz study hard etc. Yeaâ¦ I know, stop stressing me outâ¦ Although I know you want the best for me, but I realli juz need encouragement n supportâ¦ Not adviceâ¦ I can give myself adviceâ¦ But encouragement is a different matterâ¦ It is more touching n has more effect on a person when his or her loved ones give encouragement or supportâ¦  Okie, enough abt thatâ¦ I think you know wad I meanâ¦ Well, to be honest, I think being in sec4 is realli torturousâ¦ My ambition or u can so call it as a ambition has absolutely nothing and I say again Absolutely nothing got to do with wad I m learning now or wad I have learnt so farâ¦ Oh sighâ¦ I realli cannot stand Singaporeâs teaching systemâ¦ It SUX!!!  Well, being sick n staying at home the whole day oso sucksâ¦ It juz gets on my nerves being enclosed in an areaâ¦ I know this sounds crazy, but I m a bit claustrophobic I guessâ¦ Even though my house is nowhere near being considered as small, but I juz canât stand being enclosed in an area for too longâ¦ esp. when I m not doing anithing productiveâ¦ It juz bugs the hell out of meâ¦ N I guess a huge contributing factor to me being in a cranky bad mood is oso bcoz I still feel a bit sickâ¦ Oh man, I knowâ¦ I should juz shut up n quit complainingâ¦ Fine, I willâ¦  Quote: For life in the present there is no death.

I m crappingâ¦ Oh sighâ¦  Okie, right from the topâ¦ I juz came back from the esplanadeâ¦ from helping See ching n the rest selling stuffâ¦ Its like a art fair larâ¦ Something like learning all abt entrepreneurship and all thatâ¦ That is so not the impt. partâ¦ the impt. part was I woke up like ultra early to go meet See ching n then we took her Dadâs car with Sze Hwei to the âUnder the bridgeâ thingyâ¦   Which was basically pure crap bcoz there was like no air-con and all thatâ¦ And it was rather hot down thereâ¦ To add on, I helped out with publicity which was to basically walk around n tell pple to go to our stallâ¦ Stall 2â¦ âThumbnailsââ¦ it was freaking tiringâ¦ And that was like the MAIN reason why my legs are like engaging in a war with me nowâ¦  So I went around with Gerald, practically like begging pple to go to our stallâ¦ which to be honest, did not help in sales ONE bitâ¦ Oh well, so we decided to be smart and go backâ¦=) Finallyâ¦ had some time to sit down and restâ¦ But trust me, it wasnât for longâ¦ Soon after, had to be helping out at the stall and was like a salesgalâ¦ Calling out to ppleâ¦ âCan I help you? or âWhy dun u look around?â and even âHi, welcome to our stallâ¦ We sell blar blar blarâ¦â Sheeshâ¦ It was realli tiringâ¦ And to be honest, even though I m not obliged to help and all that, I felt rather pissed off lorâ¦  In truth, ONLY me n Wendy were realli doing stuffâ¦ We were realli like selling our stuff etc. the rest was like doing I dunno wadâ¦ Seriously, why the hell did they even come for? Well, Gerald helped around... I mean, at least he got publicize in the frontâ¦ but after we went back to the stall, they all started to slackâ¦ n I m not like the main person in charge but I was like putting my all n working my ass off for them n See Ching n Cheryl was like talking tgtâ¦   Then when I tell them to like get customers n all that, they were like âWe shouldnât go n snatch other stalls customersâ¦â I mean , come onâ¦ the other stalls were the ones who came to snatch our customers in the 1st placeâ¦ N it is bcoz we have pple who were slacking instead of doing their jobs there thatâs why we had poor salesâ¦ Or least, could have gotten BETTER salesâ¦  What the hell larâ¦ Getting more pissed by the minuteâ¦ Joanne n Jeanette were also ther helping out with doing the test tubes n stuffâ¦ At least they help aroundâ¦ But Kar Keat n Shi Yin n Mei Hui they all were juz a PURE bunch of LOSERSâ¦ Sheesh, why did they even come in the 1st place? Ultra extraâ¦ doing NOTHING!!! And Kar Keat was like asking me to entertain the customers who were looking aroundâ¦ HELLOâ¦ I m NOT from ARTâ¦ I DUN HAVE to help uâ¦ why cant u help out??? Then, some more, he kept hogging the seatsâ¦ 1 of the 2 pathetically given seats that we hadâ¦   Which comes to Yuen Hoiâ¦ I was ULTRA angry with him tooâ¦ DIN do anithing, blocking the way all the timeâ¦ being ultra extraâ¦ complaining abt how he shouldnât have come in the first placeâ¦ irritating me in hope of knowing more abt wad happened betwn Han Yun n the rest of the gangâ¦ He was juz a PAIN in the ASS!!! He was another idiot which kept hogging the seats tooâ¦ Wad a loserâ¦  Okie, I m pissed offâ¦ well, I guess its bcoz I m like I said, Freaking tired nowâ¦ will not bad-mouth other pple nowâ¦ I feel badâ¦ Sighâ¦ Well, thatâs the gist of my dayâ¦ And feeling so tired, I m going to do Yin Wenâs html thingy on her blogâ¦ Hope it turns out wellâ¦ Will talk more abt the happy stuff that happened today, laterâ¦ or perhaps tmr larâ¦  Quote: Desire is half of life, indifference is half of death.

No big deal larâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Aniwae, like I said that I would continue ydayâs entry, much things have happened since I last blogged n well, I will juz try n recall all of themâ¦  First of all, my clique did not forget about my bdae at allâ¦ They actualli arranged this ermâ¦ Mini celebration at Haagen Daz ice-cream parlor with a cake n all thatâ¦ Well, to be honest, I m veri surprised n happi n touchedâ¦ Totally touchedâ¦ But not when I know that Swee Fan was goingâ¦ I mean, I know that I hhave made peace with her n all thatâ¦  Not like I hate her or wadsoeva butâ¦ I mean, the day before my Cheryl asked me if I was going to be free the next day n that we were all going outâ¦ But she nv said abt Swee Fan going alongâ¦ I mean, I know I can be veri stubborn but then, they nv mentioned her going along n before the exams on Tuesday, she mentioned herself that she was going to play pool with some other ppleâ¦ But right after the exams, she was like tagging along with usâ¦  Wad m I supposed to feel? I mean I totally appreciate wad they did for me but I juz wanna spent that special time with my cliqueâ¦my special frens n not like wadsoevaâ¦ Itâs juz not right to meâ¦ So, I apologise afterwards for my very weird behaviour then n oso for my ultra bad mood at that timeâ¦ but I still wun be in a good mood if this happened againâ¦ Its juz more of wad I feel larâ¦ Kinda like this thing is between me n my good frens n I wun welcome outsiders at allâ¦  Oh well, enough about thatâ¦ Sighâ¦ So tiredâ¦gonna sleepâ¦be back later

      2004-02-13 6:33 p.m.  Bloggingâ¦ finally! I realli miss bloggingâ¦ In ani case, todae is Fridae. Yea. I can finally take a break from studying till next Mondayâ¦ Bleahz. Exams suck. Not that I m like totally stressed up n all bcoz I m not. But, stillâ¦ Exams Sux! Sighâ¦ Having not typed stuff for so long, I m like a foreigner to this keyboard.  Aniwae, todae is May 14th.I m 16 n no one knows... My birthdayâ¦ Yeaâ¦ Rightâ¦  Happi Birthday to me Happi Birthday to me Happi Birthday to me~ Happi Birthday to me.  Sigh. Apparently, NOBODY remembered about my birthdae. At least, not my close frens cum cliqueâ¦ And I m not so bu yao lian to go n remind themâ¦ At least, thatâs how I feelâ¦ I wun go around n remind pple abt my bdae so that they will remember n buy me a present etc. Nope. Not my style. In ani case, the number of pple who remembered my bdae can be counted on one handâ¦ Oh well, wad to do? I din remind them. But then again, to be honest, I think it is a frenâs duty to remember abt your best frens bdaeâ¦ No need to remind them. So, I received no presentsâ¦nothing. Kinda like last yearâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Guess I gotta get used to my boring life since pple tend to treat me as an invisible person such that if I dun talk when we r out in a group, nobody noticesâ¦  Sometimes I wonder if I m just being sensitive but I alwaize notice everything abt everyone around me n the little details that pple dun remember. To be honest, thatâs good in a way, but it truly sux in anotherâ¦ It juz seems like I care abt others n all that n when I m down or wadsoeva, nobody takes the time to notice n careâ¦ Yea rightâ¦ Now I m beginning to sound pathetic. Sighâ¦ I m NOT patheticâ¦ My mom n dad remembered. Steph, Rach remembered. Some of my classmates remembered. Added to a nice total of ermâ¦ letâs seeâ¦ 7 ppleâ¦ Hahaâ¦ So interesting huh~  Kinda like my sec2 yearâ¦ No one remembered tooâ¦ Oh noâ¦ Kinda feel my existence on earth being threatenedâ¦ Like something is taking over n soon I will be left with nothingâ¦ Juz another invisible gal living on earthâ¦ Juz another human. Damn! I dun wanna be like thatâ¦ It totally sux! One day, Juz one dayâ¦ I m gonna make it bigâ¦ Make it so BIG that pple will remember meâ¦ At least, I hope soâ¦ I dun wanna be juz another average person living on earth. I dun wanna be living for nothingâ¦ I want a meaningful lifeâ¦  My Birthday wish this year? Of coz to do well for Oâs n get into Temesek Polytechnic larâ¦ Sighâ¦ Another thing to be stressed aboutâ¦ Oh well, Wad to do? Thatâs life right? Which reminds meâ¦ The classmates that I m not so ultra close to remembered abt my bdaeâ¦ My Best Fren in classâ¦ Or rather USED to be Best Fren until she got snatched awae from me by that parasiteâ¦ Forgot abt my bdae tooâ¦ Okieâ¦ I shall quit complainingâ¦ Or pple will start to say I m making a huge fuss over nothingâ¦  Quote: I dun wanna be invisible.

      2004-02-08 6:11 p.m.  Finally after eonsâ¦ I m back againâ¦ I know I know, I told myself that I wun blog again until after exams but I realli have lots of things to say n besides, THIS IS IT! I have had it with muggingâ¦ Looking at another textbook now will juz drive me CRAZY! Pple out there muggingâ¦ I think u will understand wad I m trying sayâ¦ Arghhâ¦ Exams SUX!  Aniwae, let us refrain from the veri veri stressful subject, lots of things have happenedâ¦  1.Gerald n me r NOT an item. Juz wanna stress that outâ¦ He is my fren alwaize will beâ¦ someone whom I dun have to act in front.of. Someone whom I can totally show the bad side of me in front of. Someone whom I can unabashedly talk abt sex n stuff like thatâ¦  2.Okieâ¦ Next, there is this person in class whom realli makes me SICK to the Stomach. Her initials? Well, I will be nice n not say itâ¦ Her name? Hmmâ¦ Since she is is so ULTRA thick-skinned n so proud of itâ¦ Let me publicise for herâ¦ Ms Lee Han Yun is the perfect candidate fot being a Bacteriaâ¦ Esp. the kind which gets into your eye n infects your eye till even looking at her will want to make u blindâ¦  Awwwâ¦ I m SO sorry for being so direct n being SO meanâ¦ Its juz that I truly cant help it. She probably has this sign up on her forehead. Pls ROLL your EYES when u look at me! Well, wad cant I do? Try not to look her? Yeaâ¦ Something like thatâ¦ Unfortunately, sheâs oso like a parasiteâ¦ the kind who causes harm to anioneâ¦ M I exaggerating? Yesâ¦ I cant help it. The pure sight of her even lurking at the side of my eye totally irks meâ¦ Perhaps I should start this anit-Han yun campaignâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I will considerâ¦  So, let me countâ¦ The truly COUNTLESS times I have rolled my eyesâ¦ Ask Geraldâ¦ I think he will know wad I meanâ¦ Goosebumpsâ¦ Ewwâ¦  Okie, so, like I say, lots of things have been happeningâ¦ So much such that my lousy short term memory doesnât rememberâ¦ Hmmâ¦ To those who have been keeping track of my veri lamofied life? Good for uâ¦ U get the first hand knowledge to how sad n pathetic my life is now since I havenât been drinkingâ¦ In other words? One wordâ¦Sian. Andâ¦ I juz realised that almost 80% of the humans I know on earth Smoke! No big deal to me, but the thought has crossed my mindâ¦ I think I will die of lung cancer when I grow up. N u know wad? I totally DUN give a damn. Like I said, I wanna die early, so no biggie hereâ¦  N another thingâ¦ Saw the Duh~ commercial abt âSTOP wearing brasâ thingyâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Perhaps I m Duh~ will stop wearing bras to sleep at night nowâ¦ Some researchers say that if u do, your breasts will sag in the futureâ¦ Wadevaâ¦ I dun realli care abt tt but its true abt letting your boobs have some âbreathing spaceâ so, yeaâ¦ will most do soâ¦  Andâ¦ update abt me n that deaf gal at home? Well? No progressâ¦ I m totally looking forward to FREE Living Space when she goes to Taiwan next week. So, Lord? Pls do me the favour n take it as my bdae present!  Well, thatâs all I can think of nowâ¦ cya soonâ¦ I hope.

      2004-02-02 11:31 p.m.  Its been so longâ¦ Reallli so damn long since I touched this keyboard n used the computerâ¦ Lots of things to say as usual, but NO TIME! So wad to do? I will juz cut this all short. Resting nowâ¦ Watching Americanâs Top Model. After I watch it I m so gonna MUG! Cant help it, exams r realli nearing soonâ¦ Sighâ¦ Totalli stressed up.  Okie, forget abt the past few daysâ¦ I have no time or brain energy to remember wad happenedâ¦ In ani case, I will juz talk abt todae. Todae was basically a totalli fine dayâ¦ Went out to have lunch with Gerald after school. It was kinda like a Study Date larâ¦ I actualli asked him out on the weekends but was studying my ownself n couldnât make it. Aniwae, so we went to the Soupâs Placeâ¦ A realli nice shop at EastPoint owned by Lixingâs parentsâ¦ Not badâ¦ Food was ultra cheap n tasted truly fineâ¦ I felt that it was worth my money that kindâ¦  Decent meal n decent priceâ¦ Hmmâ¦ I urge pple to go there n try itâ¦ Okieâ¦ Getting to the point here. So, Gerald taught me lots of Emaths stuffâ¦ He basically summarised all of wad I was supposed to be learning this year into the few hours we spent thereâ¦ Totally GRATEFULâ¦ Sometimes I truly wonderâ¦ Wad would I do without Gerald? Hmmâ¦ I knowâ¦ I alwaize bully him bcoz I have the right of the wayâ¦ And he never gets angry with meâ¦ Awwâ¦ =P  Oh wellâ¦ The results r outâ¦ Adrianne wonâ¦ Like I knew she wouldâ¦ Hahaâ¦ Went to check up on the results on the internet last timeâ¦ Okieâ¦ This osos marks a Goodbye to bloggingâ¦ Will most probably blog in a few days timeâ¦ which to me is a living nightmareâ¦ Having to study somemore like crazyâ¦ Sighâ¦ Going nowâ¦ Byeâ¦

Teachers in school labelled him STUPID lorâ¦  I dun believe that I wun be able to make it in the society juz bcoz I fail Amaths or Emaths or bcoz I juz get borderline passes for Chemisrtyâ¦ This totally does not mean that I dun try my best n study hard at home or that I have no brains at allâ¦ Wad the hell larâ¦ Talking abt this makes me more pissedâ¦ I tell uâ¦ One day I will definitely make my mark in the society n come back to show off in front of these stupid tchers facesâ¦ Look down on me larâ¦ GO AHEAD!

      2004-01-26 9:04 p.m.  I had a totally interesting day todaeâ¦ Hmmâ¦ First things firstâ¦ We got back our Oral results n I got 36â¦ 36!!! 36 upon 40â¦ Whoaâ¦ Is that cool or wad? I did feel that I did well but din think I was going to get this high bcoz like I saidâ¦ Pat. Wongâs face was like totally misleading meâ¦ In ani case, I m NOT complaining abt the marksâ¦=) So proud of myselfâ¦ To those who din do well, I m not trtying to rub it in your faces but heyâ¦ perhaps its bcoz of the tcher u got? I meanâ¦ I shouldnât be saying that Pat. Wong is bias coz she is notâ¦ I mean, I m not like her best student or wadsoeva n I had although I nv realli join in the bitching abt her but I do agree that she isnt a veri good english tcherâ¦ Besides, Yuen Hoi who got her din do veri well tooâ¦  I cant believe itâ¦ I m still kinda shockedâ¦ Expected a 32 or 34 the highestâ¦ but not 36â¦ smilezâ¦ M in a good moodâ¦ n nothing can spoil thatâ¦ Another good thing is that I completed Excretion of Bio n m right on timeâ¦ I hopeâ¦ for the mid-yrsâ¦ Heheâ¦  Okieâ¦ now to the interesting part of wad happened todaeâ¦ First of all, I went to eat lunch with Gerald at Pastaâ¦ Had fun thereâ¦talked crap as usualâ¦ Heheâ¦Okie, then in the bus, I asked him to msg my sister bcoz I forgot to bring my keys n wanted to ask her if she would be staying at homeâ¦ Told her that I would be going home at abt 4:45 n so onâ¦ She said she wanted to go out but will stay at home till I come homeâ¦Okieâ¦ get the facts clearâ¦ I m not lyingâ¦ Juz telling the story straightâ¦ I DID NOT force her to stay home n wait for me right? I DID NOT say this to herâ¦ U MUZ stay home n wait for meâ¦ She was NOT obliged to stay home n wait for meâ¦ She VOLUNTARY agreed to do soâ¦ So farâ¦ M I right? This is not from my point of viewâ¦ Itâs a Factâ¦  Next upâ¦ I came home early after having a fun time with Gerald eatingâ¦ I din want her to wait too long for me since she told me she wanted to go outâ¦ Isnt this like a normal thing a human being will do? Coz I feel bad that she has to wait for me n all thatâ¦ so of coz I try n hurry back larâ¦ Duh~! Okieâ¦ so now it comes to the main gist of the storyâ¦ I came home n rang the doorbell for eonsâ¦ Like approximately 15min? Yeaâ¦ Kinda like thatâ¦ Why did I have to ring the doorbell for so long? Hmmâ¦ Y dun we all go ask our veri DEAF n veri innocent sister? How the hell m I supposed to know that she was Hard of Hearing? I mean, Godâ¦ Give me a signâ¦ Hello~`â¦  Thatâs not allâ¦ Okieâ¦ tell me who wun be pissed off after ringing the doorbell for so long n having no one answering n yet knowing there is someone at home? Sheeshâ¦ I know I should have thought of going downstairs n call home but yeaâ¦ call me stupidâ¦ I m totally ok with thatâ¦ But I know I can nv beat my DUMBASS sister at thatâ¦ She bags the award for Hard of Hearing plus Deaf plus Attitude Problem n Bitch all tgtâ¦ Wowâ¦ Should I give her a Standing ovation? Yesâ¦ Pple letâs put our hands tgt n clap for the total Freaking Bitch who is abt to receive her awardâ¦ (*Applause*)  Rightâ¦ Back to my veri ultra interesting storyâ¦ She opened the door at lastâ¦ After wad would seem like the time an old crippled lady took to walk from Singapore to Americaâ¦ N guess wad? She gave me a TOTAL PISSED OFF face n said âWadâs wrong?â Bcoz I rang the doorbell consecutively for abt 1000timesâ¦ N finalli she managed to hear the 1 time that she CLAIMS to have heardâ¦ Or rather not since she said that she DIN hear anithing at all n that the doorbell wasnât workingâ¦  Wow! The doorbell wasnât workingâ¦ Realli? Nahâ¦ Me being meâ¦ Wasnât born juz yday like she thought I wasâ¦ I checked the doorbell again as I came into the houseâ¦ It rangâ¦ LOUD  CLEARâ¦ Perfectly fineâ¦ Nowâ¦ Is it my ears that r hearing things not supposed to be heard or wad? I will admitâ¦ Patience is NOT my virtueâ¦ I was pissed at that momentâ¦ Of coz I wasâ¦ Who wouldnât be? I wun denyâ¦ I gave her the I-m-pissed-off faceâ¦ I mean, in that kinda circumstances, I TOTALLY felt that she deserved itâ¦   So I came into the house n heard her room kinda playing loud musicâ¦ Quite loud larâ¦ That isâ¦ Den of coz I was thinkingâ¦ Qith music that loud? A perfect hearing person wun be able to hear the numerous times I BANGED my hand on the door n the MANY times I rang the doorbellâ¦ So, of coz I thoughtâ¦ If u din hear then fineâ¦ I mean, juz admit larâ¦ I wun kill youâ¦ Juz DUN give me LAME excusesâ¦ so not my typeâ¦ Duh~  N then I admitâ¦ I was pissedâ¦ I opened the windows at my room n my parentâs room with a loud soundâ¦ The sliding kind will give off a sound on huge impact to the side of the wallâ¦ So, yeaâ¦ N she came out of her room YELLING at meâ¦ âI din hear u ring the bell at all okâ¦ Dun go around banging the windows juz bcoz u r not happyâ Yeaâ¦ See I emphasize on the word YELLINGâ¦ See arâ¦ From the startâ¦ Who was the victim? Meâ¦ I stood outside waiting like hell n then who yells at me when I come in? HER! Did I yell at her? NO. Did I even SHOUT at her or raise my voice? NO.   See? Muz get the facts clear horâ¦ I did nothing of that sortâ¦ Who was the LOW CLASS Bitch? Certainly not meâ¦=) Okieâ¦ So, she started shouting at me abt how she din hear the doorbell n wadsoeva n that I m a attitude problem n wadsoeva n that how my mom alwaize calls her to complain abt me wadsoevaâ¦ Blar Blar Blarâ¦ Was I listening? Nope. I was juz putting the ironed out clothes back into my parents cupboard in my parents roomâ¦ N then later she shouted at me if I was listening n I juz TOTALLY gave her the Cold Shoulderâ¦ I mean, I felt that she din derserve my attention towards her ONE bitâ¦ Nope. Heyâ¦ I wun waste my precious time talking to unreasonable n deaf bitchesâ¦  N guess wad again? She stood at the doorway of my parents room like she had the right to yell at me n I was so I in the wrong n when I put back all the clothes n was abt to juz walk pass her out of the room, she GRAB my hand n shout at me n asked if I was listening to herâ¦ Was I? Nope. Did I ignore her once me? Yes. I should have won the award for ignoring ppleâ¦ Boy m I proud of myselfâ¦ Dun ever let scums bother your lifeâ¦ Not worth one bitâ¦ Not even 1 secondâ¦  So, I juz shook my hand off, walked awae n off into my roomâ¦ At that time, I realli felt the VICTORY manâ¦ I mean, I could totally see the victory flag being raised n all that in my headâ¦ Come onâ¦ Lets juz think abt itâ¦ She wanted to pick a fight with me or else she wun come over n start raising her voice at me right? So I usse the ignoration tacticâ¦ N I know for a fact that it sux when u r yelling/shouting or even cursing at someone who is indefferent towards uâ¦ Bcoz that someone doesnât even give a damn abt wad u say abt her, u get even more pissedâ¦ Its more of like a psychological thingâ¦ How our minds workâ¦  So who was more pissed in the end? HER. Who had fun? ME. Who won the fight? ME. Who lost the battle even before it started? HER. Who ultimalty had the best of it all? ME!!! Hahaâ¦ I rock!  I know this is a realli long entryâ¦ Oppsâ¦ will log off nowâ¦ Hope I havent strained your eyesâ¦ Heheâ¦ in ani case, the current situation between me n the hard of hearing bitch is cold warâ¦ N I mean the cold war without event the communication at allâ¦ I juz pretend as usual like how I did juz now that I dun have a sister n such a person doesnât exist in my lifeâ¦ VICTORY!!!

Wong is nice enough to give me an ok markâ¦ yeaâ¦ I purposely went to find her to be my tcher as she gave me a rather high mark last yearâ¦ At least, I felt that it was rather high larâ¦32 or 33 upon 40â¦ Cant realli remember thoroughlyâ¦ Aniwae, our topic was on y we wanna scare ourselvesâ¦ I juz crappedâ¦ Hope I did fineâ¦  Well, havent been feeling at my best todaeâ¦ Dunno wadâs wrong with meâ¦ I came home after Orals n then slept like a pig for 3hoursâ¦ Later after studying history, I slept some moreâ¦ I nearly went to bang my head against the wall after waking up n realized how much precious time I lost juz by sleeping n not studying for the mid-yrsâ¦ Perhaps I m giving myself too much stress such that I cant cope with my own body systemâ¦ Wad did I juz say? I have no ideaâ¦ Scratch thatâ¦ Wad I meant was juz that my body cant take the stress I m giving itâ¦ Yeaâ¦ Thatâs wad I meantâ¦  Okieâ¦ So, taking my break time to update my blog nowâ¦ Nothing much happened todaeâ¦ But I muz say that I m suffering from realli BAD backaches due to carrying too much books to n fro from my schoolâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ I think I should not bring so much stuff to school from now onâ¦ I wonder if I can like âspoilâ my spine bcoz of thatâ¦ Hmmmâ¦ Aniwae, my lower back of my spine n the muscles around it r realli like âbunched upâ such that I cant sit or stand properlyâ¦ Sighâ¦  Well, as usualâ¦ no quote againâ¦ dun wanna rack my brains for a suitable quoteâ¦ Gonna study biology nowâ¦ cya soonâ¦ I hopeâ¦

      2004-01-21 10:45 p.m.  Hmmâ¦ Lots of things happened todaeâ¦ Well, one of the most impt. thing was having our Oralsâ¦ It was rather easy n I felt that I was realli luckyâ¦ Got Wang Wenxian as my tcherâ¦ Actualli, Soon Li was availableâ¦ But me n Joanne knew that she was veri niao~ one n wun give high marksâ¦ So we purposely hide behind the door n wait for a space for the nicer tchersâ¦ In the end Joanne went in b4 me n I waited for Wang Wenxianâs space to be freeâ¦ Luckily Henry came out right after Joanne went in so I was sorta the last in that group n managed to get herâ¦ Yay~!  Thinking back, I kinda wonder if I did well or notâ¦ Oh sighâ¦ Juz get over itâ¦ Since its over, wellâ¦ I will juz be expectant n await for the resultsâ¦ I m currently eating my dinner soup againâ¦ Itâs the leftovers of ydayâ¦ Dun get me wrongâ¦ Not complaining abt leftoversâ¦ I mean, who m I to complain when there r pple out there starving bcoz of no food in Africa etc. Besides, I alwaize eat leftoversâ¦ So no biggie hereâ¦  Okieâ¦ Now abt the Big thingâ¦ The Graduation nightâ¦ Or some would like to call it the Prom Nightâ¦ The night where we r all Glamorous n allâ¦ Hmmâ¦ Nice thought of having to dress up etc. =) I know I knowâ¦ I opposed to the idea like mad when pple kept asking me to goâ¦ Yepâ¦ I still doâ¦ I mean, First of allâ¦ Four Seasons Hotel? Patheticâ¦ M I complaining? YES! Sheesh wad a placeâ¦ Go to Ritz-Carlton or some other better hotel larâ¦ I mean, Four Seasonsâ¦ Pleaseâ¦ n to those who were like âFour Seasons not bad wadâ¦â Hellooo~~â¦ WAD world do u live in? That is certainly not the best hotel aroundâ¦  Okieâ¦ So u get wad u pay forâ¦ Thatâs certainly not trueâ¦ I believe that if we had more competent n I mean COMPETENT staff in our school who were willing to negotiate abt the price in some other more renowned hotelâ¦ I would have gladly goneâ¦ Aniwae, which brings me back to why I m goingâ¦ First of allâ¦ I truly wonder why tooâ¦ But after reading Geraldâs blog yday, I realized that Gerald, Ching, Hwei n Cheryl r all going due to Hwei being roped in by Wendyâ¦ Another long story... Aniwaeâ¦ after reading, I was considering whether I should go or notâ¦ Since my best frens r goingâ¦ N well, I can alwaize be with themâ¦ Den, I called up hwei n asked wad happened n why they were going to go since we long decided to boycott this eventâ¦  So its here where the long story gets in n after talking to Hwei, I was like Totally considering on whether I should go to the Grad night tooâ¦ N thenâ¦ after further deliberation, I went online to talk to Ray. He was giving me some reasons to go bcoz I will feel left outâ¦ Which wasnât realli a valid reason, but yeaâ¦ I know wad he was trying to meanâ¦ Like having your frens all come back n talk all abt the Prom n I will be like I wish I had gone etc.   In addition, talking to see ching in the car todae was totally like comfirming my thoughts that I should goâ¦ So, I mâ¦ Well, I juz said that I would go if there is a seatâ¦Its like we have to form a group to have a seating at the tableâ¦ which is a table of 10â¦ So, yeaâ¦ I din have a seatâ¦ N according to wad I heard, registration had alreadi closedâ¦ But see ching said that she will help me go ask Wendy n grab a place for meâ¦  Thank goodness, they still took pple inâ¦ So right now, its like I will be squeezing at their tableâ¦ Which will have 11 ppleâ¦ Which is no big deal since I doubt we will all be sitting down the whole time as u knowâ¦ We would most probably be walking around, talking, taking pictures etc. You knowâ¦ I can imagine the sceneâ¦ Its gonna be typicalâ¦ Soâ¦ good larâ¦ I got a seat n will have to pay for the deposit tmrâ¦=)  Oppsâ¦ I havenât asked my mom for the money yetâ¦ Oh`oâ¦ Heheâ¦ I hope she wun nag at meâ¦ Hmmmâ¦ Aniwae, tmr got emaths common testâ¦ which to no surprise, I havenât studied yetâ¦ Heheâ¦ Will be studying later larâ¦ I was taking my time doing the emaths Probability hw juz nowâ¦ N after that, I completed the Chem wks that i was supposed to hand in todaeâ¦ Opps!...=P Aniwae, I was rather proud of myselfâ¦ Itâs a long time since I realli sat down n realli bother to do the hw that Mrs. Lim givesâ¦ N I found out this ultra careless mistake of mine that made me re-do the question15 againâ¦ Arghhâ¦ See larâ¦ Take up so much of my time lorâ¦   Speaking of which, I have this Crazy Chem test on Fridayâ¦ Did I mention Crazy? Yeaâ¦ It is crazyâ¦ I mean, Total Duh~ 16 chaptersâ¦ N our DEAREST Ms Chan told us abt the test on Mondayâ¦ So nice of her right? Okieâ¦ So the test type is MCQâ¦ So wad? We still have to study for it right? To those who dun n r doing realli fine in chemâ¦ Boo to U!!! Rightâ¦ So I would most probably have to study like a cranky idiot tmrâ¦ Greatâ¦ Why couldnât she be kind for once n tell us b4 the weekends so I could have at least flipped through? Darn her...  Lessons todae was alrightâ¦ Nothing special to reportâ¦ Surprisingly, Ms Chan din yell much at me during Chem Pracâ¦ Hmmmâ¦ Maybe I m improvingâ¦=) Okieâ¦ I will stop crapping n goâ¦ cya~  Quote: Wait, I just remembered something! Iâm boring and your legs canât work! Hahaâ¦ I knowâ¦ totally LAME quoteâ¦ sorrie ppleâ¦ m running out of nice quotesâ¦

Not the least bit stressedâ¦ Sheeshâ¦ I m do DuH~â¦ Well, guess thatâs all for todae... Btw, todaeâs quote will be taken from the Americaâs Top Model that I saw yday nightâ¦ Tyra Banks said it n I like her n oso felt wad she said was rather meaningfulâ¦ So here it isâ¦  Quote:Human is Beautiful, Perfect is boring.
