      I am an evil temptress Iâll grab your soul and rip it from Your heart And devour it in one gulp I spin the web I circle and dance In your heart you try to forget me But you canât I breathe life into your very cells and Your blood flows like the ice that Melts from the tallest peak of the Tallest mountain Your begging to be releasedâ¦but I look into your eyes and let You drown in my touch Your depth of feeling simmers like A pot full of such nourishment I can sense a beautyâ¦a  purity..a Clarity. And I feel myself soften Under your gaze My heart is aching, its aching for Youâ¦but Iâm full of fear, this fear Is like concrete across my heart You hold me steady with your gaze I can feel myself sinking like Quicksand into your soulâ¦it feels So intense Iâm trippingâ¦tripping into Your essence, and still you gaze Into my eyes My fearful tears flow and you let  Them fall down my cheeksâ¦dripping Onto my breastsâ¦body heaving as The fear overtakes me You hold me My body burns like fire, but the Fire is cleansing I have found safety in your Gazeâ¦I have found acceptance in Your gaze You consume me The Evil Temptress no longerâ¦but The Gentle Goddess.  Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      We are all born with our own stone But we must journey inward to listen To our story. It is then that we can Journey to the lake of understanding And cast our stone! We listen within to our ancestors to our Questions The rave circles above us to bring Us hope for our healingâ¦his ebony Wings like a cloud shrouding us in The shadows so that we may listen To our pain undisturbedâ¦feeling Itâ¦being itâ¦understanding it Then moving outward from under the dark shadows Dancing in the light, the dove flying In with peace and love Casting the stone into the lake we Walk away free from our haunted  Past.

      She stood silent in the night wearing A cloak of the purest opalesenceâ¦her Beauty was ethereal, the love that Glowed from within was pureâ¦ Strong like the finest note The man looked at her with eyes Of misunderstanding, his soul could not See her beautyâ¦he felt it but could Not reach it, his heart was closed She wept for the closed heartâ¦but Knew she could not stay in the place  Of darknessâ¦she was called into the Lightâ¦there she could breathe and Be all she knew herself to be The black horse appeared, and She climbed in his backâ¦journeyed To the lake She gazed upon the mirror glass Lake for lifetimesâ¦content knowing This was her place and her turn  Would come She reached down to touch The Mother. Her hand was lead to a stone, And like the stone unturned, she Had waited upon the earth for her Timeâ¦the time had come With an inner knowing she cast The stone into the very centre of The lake where it landed and Rippled outwardâ¦reaching everywhereâ¦ Touching everything. She is awakened the goddessâ¦she Has healedâ¦she has walked awayâ¦ She has walked towardsâ¦and so She isâ¦The Goddess!  Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      Hawk Flying free in the sky If your going to sweep the sky and Feel the wind come rushing by remember That I told you to be free Yes I will remember it is written upon My heart If your going to spread your wings And hear the song that freedom sings Remember that I told you to be free It is set in stone The pattern is carved there Yes set in stone We weaved a tapestry Each stitch symbolic Like a spiral ever turning inward Upon itself then moving outward to Face the world A new day rises from the ashes of The old like a phoenix Yes like a phoenix my love I fly like a dove into the cold winter Sky The ship upon the wind tossed sea The storm is brewing in the melting pot Bitter cold like an icicle but complete And rich in its beauty Let us drink mulled wine by a Fire blazing in its full fledged glory Lay upon the skin of a bear The glow of after light seen Through your hair I want something real For my soul to grip Like hot chocolate and honey drip A silver spoon to eat with my dear The twinkle in your eye The shadow of your smile I see your hand before me The dagger you hold there To face the blade of mercury I canât hold back The blood must flow But the fear overruns me The damn of emotions flow Beneath the swell of thunder This heart begins to glow And beat within my chest Never giving me rest I want to scream to the sun And howl at the moon To scream in your face Its never too soon To cower away as If Iâd been burned Hush child Fall into yourself Travel to the great and mighty oz We walk the yellow brick road The mirror of intent You are hell bent Sell the bricksâ¦Oh No! You Canât! Itâs not real gold you see A fake a fraud Unauthentic dear It is sad and pitiful But do you care? But he said it was real He is full of blackness Where was your heart When you looked upon the stone Hush child  Love to you Lochy!~ Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      I wept for the wounding I did not know where I was I have arrived I require no luggage I came from nowhere No one knows who I am I am anonymous The light is brilliant here I do not know my path But I journey regardless Of course you think Iâm crazy Iâm homesick I saw it float into the sky free And weightless, beautiful, abundant No one understands me god damn it The light is brilliant The fear takes over What is it? I donât know The chains people shackle themselves with Time is running out for everyone Oh my god!!! Yes..Iâm feeling fine Stay here and be prepared for anything I feel aloneâ¦ My heart beats to a timeless beat  Alone in a sea of confusion But yet the peace is here also It lifts me up for eternity The universe will expand and collapse Back on itself Get it right this time This time is all you have.

      I choose to have the freedom to Dance and play. To feel the gifts as I sit and watch The wind dancing and playing in the  Trees. To see the trees dance together As though in lifes ball-room so Majestic and free. Such passion and strength of colour Muted together into a tapestry of Truth. The honour to be part of such beauty Energizes my being. The sun shyly peeks over the  Mountains and under the clouds, Sharing its light and love, playfully Skipping across the water. Like children all around me, nature Laughingâ¦playing..dancingâ¦smiling.  Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      Time is an illusion. Only now exists, and you are only ever here. What are you going to do now? Are you going to wander through the coridors of your past like a Nomad lost in the desertâ¦or trip Into the future with expectations that resembles pictures of your past. Your thoughts can take you on magnificent journeysâ¦ But stay awake with your thoughtsâ¦ Do not journey whilst sleeping. You can get lost and entangled in the labarynth And when you awaken you realise Your self made trapâ¦ And the sword you must take up  To hack away at the very thoughts You had which ensnared you.

      What treasures does your Dragon protect? The cave is dark it needs a flame. There is no path! Do we build oneâ¦or do we sit and wait? I hear the moaningâ¦ Who is there? What do you want? Do you need something? Are you in pain? Listen to your pain. Dig it up and look at it. In your pain lies your treasure. Pain is love in disguise. I promise you of this sweet truth. I know, for I have faced the pain And anguish of a broken spirit. And many times I have walked through the illusion And found love nourishing me to my very core. So simple and quiet No need for loudness and crashing of drums. Wailing of voices. Just sweet and gentle like a warm summer breeze Kissing you on the face. Oh the Light what a beauty. The jewels they shine. Come forward and drink The light is yours. Your chalice cup is full, It never runs empty. Quench your thirst. If you do not drink of the cup you dehydrate  And turn to stone becoming hardâ¦ Bitter and chrystalised Then you must go in to chip away At your hard bitter shell. Drink!!! It keeps you juicy and well oiledâ¦ Flowing like a river Floating like a cloud Endlessâ¦eternal.  Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      A Beautiful explosion, then expansive space and peace. A sacred doorways right into the centre of truth. The vibration here is incredible, itâs tone exquisiteâ¦ It resonates with every cell of your being. It is pure light and you are pure light. You have come home to yourself.  You have come home to love. Everything you thought you were drops away and you are left  Expansiveâ¦nakedâ¦but fully dressed in the magnificence of your spirit. The pulseâ¦the heartâ¦it beats in unison with the oneness. Nothing else exists but this beat, Everything is birthed from this pointâ¦ And everything returns to this pointâ¦ And everything between is of love! In truth there is no separation.

      Open yourself so you may receive The sweet nectar that allows your Very essence to breathe. Do not close and constrict, but open  And expand. We are growing, this is our very nature. Allow yourself to grow into love, feel It move through you and strengthen you. It gives you courage so that you may stand tall. Trust that in your love you stand exactly Where you are meant to stand. We all do!!! But in your standing, move the love through You to all people, they need your love, and so do I my friend. For in your love is the honour and wisdom which touches everyone. Love touches everyone, but can touch in different places, And each place is like a darkness that is lit by your love. The Dragon Stirsâ¦Heed the Stirringâ¦Awaken!!!

      Look to the stars to guide your way. The cleansing waters see all. Sink into the knowingnessâ¦the void. Where darkness meets light, and truth  Is revealed with such clarity. The Returningâ¦ The Spiralâ¦ The Stoneâ¦ The Keyâ¦ To hold and turn. The time is now. The time has come. Twelve united to walk the truth forward. Light the inner fire, gather close an  Await the othersâ¦we build the bridge.   Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      to learn to give and recieve love unconditionally. I have come to experience true love..spiritual love. The more I share with others, the more I recieve. I have learnt patience, and trusted that all these good things I dream are indeed becoming my very reality. These dreams have already begun thie healing journey inside my soul, in the forms of great love and great people. I am eternally greatful to be blessed with my three beautiful children, who are teaching me wondrous things..most of all freedom and happiness. I help people to discover the freedom and happiness that lies dormant in the center of their souls. Ocassionally the love crashes to the surface, like a wave on the beach..they struggle to hold on, but the clinging and the struggle creates the loss they fear the most. I help them to realise that there is no need for clinging or struggle, we can love and be loved unconditionally, as this is our life purpose..our birthright. May the love I feel in my heart be felt by humankind all over the world, and return to me like a spiral, always growing..loving..and returning for now and ever more. So Be It!~ Goddess Bless!~ Leisa xxx

      I began my journey many moons ago in the time of the child. Little did I know then just how much influence this child would have on me. She clings to me as though her very existence depended upon it, and indeed I now know this to be true.  You see, my journey began in a time when our history was filled with the void of nothing. I tried to speak to many of my people about the void, but they did not have the ears nor the heart of compassion to hear me..I was afterall just a child.  My child grew and blossomed into a most beautiful woman, but it seemed as though it was too late, the damage had been done, indeed the scar went deep, so deep infact that I was unaware of its presence. I journeyed through many moons before I heard my stillness take over the core of my being, and like some still, quiet voice I heard the scream of someone lost.  We have all heard this scream at one time or another in our lives. It feels very primal in its center, and it radiates out, so the universe can hear and feel its contents of fear and unknowing.  It was at this moment of hopelessness, where I surrendered to something outside of myself, but the magic of this moment was where beautiful miracles were birthed into my life. Because it was in this moment I felt a glimmer of who I could be, this essence travelled to my deepest wounds and scars, to my heart, to my womb, to my center, to begin the healing journey, the real journey. And it was hear I heard these words..."Who are you really?"  Our journey all our lives has been an external one, and it is in the magic of this moment that it becomes an inward one of such magnitude, our lives are truly born. This is what I call our Spiritual Rebirth. And this is where we remember the wise and beautiful words of our child within, and we realise that this wondrous being is us. The freedom of this moment are beyond any words I can put to paper. All I can say is if you have experienced this miracle taking place in your own journey, then you know of what I speak.  For those who have never experienced this, then I challenge you to listen..what is it your child is saying to you? A word of warning..you are required to listen to your child with an open heart, and this has been known to produce cathartic results.  I will tell you this. My inner child is very much alive, and full of bliss and wonder at this experience of life. We endeavour to play and have fun connecting everyday. Indeed we have discovered this is a large part of our life~purpose. I suspect that your life purpose would not differ much from mine, sure we may live in different houses, and we certainly dwell in different bodies ( or temples, as I prefer to call them), but the overall Universal Truth is the same.  Love your truth that comes to you in the quiet times of your life, when you are full of peace and radiance. Know this shines from your innercore. Have courage to walk this challenging road with the inner knowing that you are never alone..never have been alone..and will never be alone. I know this to be true..for I have seen and felt this truth..The very Universe itself  resides within us. Love for self and know you are loved beyond measure..you are love beyond measure.  Blessings to you and yours for ever more So Be It!~ Goddess Bless!~ Leisa 1999

      There is magic all around us....        it lives within us. This magic is the energy that is rich   with life~changing potential!~  Hi my name is Leisa, and this is an insight to me...  For the past 14 years I have been on an intense personal journey. I've always been interested in all things spiritual and metaphysical ~ It has drawn me in like a magnet. From a very young age I have always had the ability to step back from my own life, and to connect with other peoples lives that are close to me. I viewed and felt their lifes as if I was them, but with the exception of being detatched emotionally. Therefore I can use this to help people to step back and view their lives from a new and fresh perspective, a perspective of the Spirit.  I have always believed that our very own thoughts create our reality, so best to live consciously!~  It is my intention to touch as many people as I can, both the female and the male in all of us. And it is my intention that my touch will release and stir a memory hidden deep within the recesses of peoples hearts everywhere.  Walk in Love    Walk in Peace       Journey Well         Goddess Bless!~              Leisa xxx
