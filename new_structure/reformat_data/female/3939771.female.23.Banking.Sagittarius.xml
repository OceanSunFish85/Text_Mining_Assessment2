						   sorry, that was a very dated reference to the other swedish pop sensation, what was the name of that group again?? but really, my life is really great right now. i like my job, i have a wonderfully behaved baby (although i don't know what she could do to misbehave at this point) and the money situation is looking up thanks to my hard-working husband.  my job has not always been so great, but now that elisa is gone for the week, it is looking up. has anyone else ever worked with someone who sucks every ray of sunshine and hope from your very being?? ok, then you know what i am talking about. she just complains about everything all the time. it starts the moment she walks in the door, and by 5:00, everyone is so miserable it's pathetic. really though, since she has been gone i noticed we all get along better, we spend less time gossiping, and the boss isn't even as stupid. hmmm . . . i wonder if anyone else is noticing the same thing.  now that work is going so well, i think i will get a new job. i have an interview in a couple of weeks with a company that would nearly double my income. the only drawbacks are longer hours and no maternity insurance for two years. these may not seem like a lot, but i feel like i have already missed to much time with my baby. i'm the only person i know that han't seen her smile. also, i want to have a child in the next eighteen months, and given the pregnancy complications (blood clots) i had with my first child, i know the second will be even more expensive. i just don't know what to do really. money . . . kid(s)???   lately i have been nagged by the poem "richard cory" by edwin arlington robinson. anyone who has stayed awake through sophomore english knows which one i am talking about the one about the rich man whom everyne envied, but he was so lonely he shot himself. depressing i know. i don't know why it has been in my head , maybe so i am careful not to envy people for their material posessions. i can't think of anyone right off hand i envy though. it's just weird really, and it is starting to get me down. oh well, enough for now.
