       What if you were asked this kind of problem, what the answer will be?   Would you dance If I asked you to dance? Would you run And never look back? Would you cry If you saw me cryin' Would you save my soul tonight?  Would you tremble If I touched your lips? Would you laugh? Oh please tell me this. Now would you die For the one you love? Hold me in your arms tonight.  "I can be your hero, baby. I can kiss away the pain. I will stand by you forever. You can take my breath away."  Would you swear That you'll always be mine? Would you lie? Would you rub in mind? A mind to deep - Have I lost my mind? I don't care you're here tonight.  "I can be your hero baby. I can kiss away the pain. I will stand by you forever. You can take my breath away."

      Why people get bored?  There are many reasons of boring eg. Love, Work, Family, Friends and etc.  Pleple build up this feeling themselves  and only that person can kill it from their mind.    Right now, I get bored with the thing I can't even deny or stop it.  I want to run away from where I am, which is not the place I should belong to.  How should I do?     Even I know that only me can eliminate it away but I still get stuck here!
