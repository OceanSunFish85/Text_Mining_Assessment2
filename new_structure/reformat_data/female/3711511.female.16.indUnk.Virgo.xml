      I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [CHORUS:] When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [Chorus]  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone And though your still with me I've been alone all along  [Chorus]

      Iâm glad I met a group like them  A group who cares with a love so true  A group who comfort wen I am blue  A group who favor wen I need u to    A group who serves as my inspiration  Who cheers me up in worse condition  Who guide in making the right decisions Who invites during special occasions.    A group who accompanies wen Iâm alone  A group who scold me if I did something wrong  A group who calls at night on the phone  A group who misses me wen Iâm gone for long.    A group who smile wenever I frown  A group who laughs and joke around  A group who advise wen I am down  A group who picks me up wen I stumble on the ground    A group who hang-out at every mall  A group catches every time I fall  A group here wenever I call   A group like them is worth my all

           There was once a girl whose only dream is to have a life worth living for and a love worth fighting for. Along the journey of this girl, she met a boy, a boy that can change her life forever. The girl and the boy became friends not just an ordinary friendship but also much closer like being the best of friends. They always help each otherÂ¡Â¯s problem regarding family, friends and even love. The boy is a sweet person, caring and loving. He always makes sure that the girl is safe and happy.       One day, the girl was being haunted with unexplainable feeling especially when sheÂ¡Â¯s with the boy. Her heart was beating fast whenever the boy starts to talk or even stare at her for a while. This feeling was being thought for a week until finally she realized that she was deeply in love with her best friend. She decided to keep her feelings because she knows that the boy will only turn her feelings down and she was also afraid that the boy would leave her and forget about their friendship. So she pretended that nothing happen.       One day again, the boy approached the girl; the boy was not acting normal while heÂ¡Â¯s talking with the girl, until finally he told her the problem. The boy said, Â¡Â°You know friend, I donÂ¡Â¯t know what to do?Â¡Â± the girl asked, Â¡Â°Why? What is the problem?Â¡Â± the boy replied, Â¡Â°I need your help, friendÂ¡Â¦ IÂ¡Â¯m deeply in love with our classmate and I know you can help me get her attention, pls. Friend doesnÂ¡Â¯t turn me downÂ¡Â¦Â¡Â± that statement stabs her heart, she wanted to cry but she must avoid it because of the boy. The boy was still waiting for her answer so she said; Â¡Â°Ok, IÂ¡Â¯ll help you!Â¡Â± from that very moment, the girl saw a different smile. For the very first time, the girl saw a smile that she never saw before thatÂ¡Â¯s why she thought that the boy would be very happy if he and their classmate will be together.      From then on, the girl always approached their classmate to make a girl conversation. She always make sure that the name of the boy will be mentioned, even if this things badly hurts her feelings she still continues to help the boy because she knows that the boy will be very happy and besides thatÂ¡Â¯s what she always wishes for. Weeks had past, months followed and the boy and their classmate started dating, once a week, twice thrice and so onÂ¡Â¦ the friendship between the boy and the girl became weak, up to the point that theyÂ¡Â¯re not talking anymore that made the girl cry every night. Until finally the boy called on the phoneÂ¡Â¦               "Hello, good morning, can I speak to..."            "Hey it's me, what's up? Any problem?"            "I have a good news friend, I'm now the official boyfriend of our classmate, aren't you happy? Hello..."       The girl was shocked, she canÂ¡Â¯t speak, tears began to fall from her teary eyes, and then the boy spoke again,                "Hello, still there?"            "Ah, yes, oh what's that again?"            "I said, I already have my girlfriend. What can you say?"            "Of course I'm happy! Congrats!"            "Thank you, oh it's time I have to call her, bye..."            "But wait..."       The boy already hanged up the phone. The girl can't help it, she cried the whole night, thinking of the things they used to do when they're still together.       Months had past and the friendship was still there. The problem is the boy always talks about his girlfriend not knowing his hurting someone, the girl managed to keep her tears with a smileÂ¡Â¦ somebody advises the girl to tell her feelings towards the boy, she refuses because of the consequence so she continued a love full of pretending and sufferingsÂ¡Â¦      One afternoon, as the boy was sleeping, he had a dream. In his dream he saw the girl in white dress sitting on a bench beside a tree, the boy approached her and asked Â¡Â°Why are you lonely? Is there a problem?Â¡Â± the girl smiled sadly and said, Â¡Â°IÂ¡Â¯m now leaving!Â¡Â± the boy replied, Â¡Â°Where are you going?Â¡Â± the girl answered, Â¡Â°IÂ¡Â¯m going on a place where you canÂ¡Â¯t see me anymore, take care of yourself and the people you loved, donÂ¡Â¯t make others cry ok. This is the first and last time IÂ¡Â¯m telling you this, I love you, I love you more than a friend will do. I love you and I always will, pls. DonÂ¡Â¯t forget me! GoodbyeÂ¡Â¦Â¡Â± the boy was shocked as the girl leaves and then his cell phone suddenly rings. The boy was awaken with that ring of his cell phone, it is a call from one of their classmates, he answer it and heard a bad news Â¡Â°your friend is on the hospital right now, come here, hurry!Â¡Â± The boy was totally shocked; he rushes up to the hospital but didnÂ¡Â¯t make it. When he arrived, the girl was already dead holding their picture together. She was rushed to the hospital because of a car accident happened three hours ago the very same moment when the boy was dreamingÂ¡Â¦      Ten years had past and the boy still manages to visit her dear best friend at least once a month. With him was a bunch of yellow roses, which is the favorite flower of the girl. One day while arranging the flowers in the girlÂ¡Â¯s grave the boy started to talk. Â¡Â°Friend, itÂ¡Â¯s been a long time, I know your listening, I would like to thank you for everything, for the memories we had, for the arguments we encountered and for the love and caring I received from you, I also want to say sorry for the things IÂ¡Â¯ve done wrongÂ¡Â¦ friend, remember our classmate? IÂ¡Â¯ll be marrying her next week and IÂ¡Â¯m afraid this will be the last time IÂ¡Â¯ll be visiting you, we will be leaving the country for goodÂ¡Â¦ thank you, sorry, and I love you friend! YouÂ¡Â¯ll always be rememberedÂ¡Â¦Â¡Â±       Raindrops began to fall as the boy left wiping his tearsÂ¡Â¦                                                                                                                                      by: MIAKA_ivy07     ...yan ang story n sinulat ko nung 4th yr. high skul mi... hope u'l appreciate it...

      I need to talk with you again, Why did you go away, All our time together, just feels like yesterday, I never thought I'd see, a single day without you, The things we take for granted we can sometimes lose. And if I promise not to feel this pain, Will I see you again, Will I see you again...  Cause time will pass me by Maybe I'll never learn to smile, But i know I'll make it through, If you wait for me. And all the tears I cry, No matter how I try. They'll never bring you home to me, Won't you wait for me in heaven.  Do you remember how it was, when we never seemed to care. The days went by so quickly, Cos I thought you'd always be there. And it's hard to let you go, Though I know that I must try. I feel like I've been cheated, Cos we never said goodbye. And if I promise not to feel this pain, Will I see you again Will I see you again...  Cause time will pass me by  Maybe I'll never learn to smile But I'll know i'll make through If you wait for me ( Won't you wait for me ) And all the tears I cry No matter how I try They'll never bring you home to me Won't you wait for me  In heaven....  Cause I miss you so And I need to know Will you wait for me.
