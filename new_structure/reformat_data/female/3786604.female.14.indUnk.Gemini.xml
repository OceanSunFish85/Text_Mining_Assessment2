       Went ice skating with Sach and both her sisâ today. It was totally awesome!!! Luved it. It realty was heaps of fun and much easier than I thought that it would be. Itâs pretty much like rollerblading only the ice skates are really easy to walk in. I fell over 3 times (which I didnât think was too bad for a 1st time) but the last 2 were because I was trying to see how fast I could go! Stupid me-I couldnât stop very well, leant back and got my self in a muddle. And before I knew it-I was on the ground!

      Just a quick post tonight kuz I have an assignment that Iâm supposed to be doing now (yes, itâs that boring science one stillâ¦). But OMG!!! I just finished off watching Friends-the one with the prom tape and I luvd it!!! If you havenât seen it, SEE IT!!! Go Ross and Rachel!!!  And also, whoever knows meâll probably also know that Dad loves pinball machines and stuff like that, but anyway, I went off to a pinball auction with him the other day and he brought a soccer table so yeahâ¦now we have one of them. It actually heaps of fun to play. But the place was packed! There was likeâ¦ 200 or something pinballâs all turned on so you could play them before the auction. It was awesome fun. Maybe I could have my birthday party at one of those thingsâ¦! Hmmâ¦I can see an idea sprouting now!  Better go now,  El

       Allâs going pretty well for me at the present moment in time. Saturday gym starts back nxt week (yay!), tramp also nxt week (double yay!!) and Gems back (triple yay!!!).    Been enjoying messing round on my beam lately. All I need now is a decent amount of room to b/f in, a set of bars (and a foam pit to go with emâ!), an in ground tramp, enough room for vault (horse and mini (single and double!)) and possibly some higher legs for my beam.    I wonât write much more because I have been most conveniently âforgettingâ about a science project thatâs due in in a few days that I should probably be doing. So until I see all you guys nxt (possibly tues, wed or fri) take care and be good (to no one IN PATICULAR (Gem!))    Luv yas, El :)

      Ey guys, Iâm typing this nd saving it as a file so god knows when itâll get published but Iâve just come home from gym nd its awesome kuz we have all this nu equipment nd beam mats nd stuff. I LUV it!!! Iâve been working on double backflips off the mini nd also saults! There awesome fun! Iâd miss gym if I didnât do it.  Iâm pretty much over what I was bummed about. I wonât write too much but I know that some of you know what I mean. Some things youâre just better off without! Nd this is one of them.  Also, I'm into songwriting a bit more than I used to be now. It's kul. I've almost finished my first half decent one (even if I do say so myself). I quite like it. The one I wrote nd songwriting in general-only I'm not quit musicly smart enough to write music-just the lyrics.  Ne way-I just might go back to waffling on bout gym kuz its heaps of fun. If you donât do it I recommend that you do at least give it ago. Caitlyn-Been searching hard for your floor music nd so far Iâve only got one piece. I think that its called something like âJazz will dieâ or something like that. No...wait...It's called 'Jazz will eat itself'. It's interesting  Geeâ¦I start to wonder why I do this when no-one really visits my blog neway!  Oh wellâ¦guess Iâll go-Luv yaz all, El  ;)

      well,( seem to use this word far too much now days) I just came back from speding a while down in Ballarat with Bon nd her family. It was quite nice and we had a fab time. almost got hit by a car, sampled a few different restraunts, saw mean girls, found out some interesting facts that put me through anger and annoyment, blew 40mins in Go-Lo! and just other crazy stuff. Off to gym now, el  :)
