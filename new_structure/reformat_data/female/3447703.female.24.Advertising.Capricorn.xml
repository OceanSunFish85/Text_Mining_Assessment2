      you know the feeling when you're busy doing something...........but in the back of your mind   there is something for you to look forward to there is something you know will come soon someone's voice you anticipate to hear  yes you never ask me to wait for your call  yet I am more than happy to wait for your call   I don't do it because you asked me to, I don't do it cuz I want you to appreciate what I would do for you. I just do it cuz I look forward to hearing your voice. And I know the time of the day when I can hear your voice is coming soon.   Don't ask me not to wait, cuz I don't need you to tell me that.    But.....I am a Grammar God!!! ahahahaaa..........which is why I don't think the person who wrote up the quiz is a grammar god him/herself......cuz many mistakes, many mistakes.    You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      The past week  Something unexplainable This feeling in my chest Smothering Suffocating  Dragging me down, down, down           into the depths of the valley   the valley of uncertainty hopelessness despair  I want to fling my arms and call for help  But I am weak from crying But I am tired from wandering But I am bursting with loneliness  Drained free of happiness Drained free of energy I lay myself down to sleep  Hoping to never wake up

      Lou gong always says,  as long as I am loyal to him, anything else are all minor.  I think maybe it has something to do with all the girls he's been with, had a bf at the time, at least in the beginning. After being the ç¬¬ä¸è so many times, he knows how easy and susceptible girls are to be unfaithful. Just as much as men.    I know of course, he has his own insecurities. And that is why this is such a test, such a big show of faith in us. Cuz right now both of us are in different continents of the world, with our doors wide open, and neither of us would ever want to fly away.    Because in this cage of love that we trap ourselves in willingly, is the best place to be. It's such a safe cozy harbor, a shelter we can retreat to when we are tired of roaming in this cruel cruel world.   It's so soothing just to hear his voice. Especially his voice when he just wakes up in the morning. And the first thing he does, even before he opens his eyes stuck together eye shit, is pick up the phone and call me.   He doesn't need to say it outloud, but I know he imagines me sleeping next to him when he does that. Lying softly in his arms, snuggling to that delicious resting place in the crook of his neck. Hear his heartbeat, wrap my arms tightly around his thin body.   And then i start jumping on him to wake him up! Rip the covers off him, and cackle at his comical shriek as he swiftly moves into the fetal position to protect his.......to the place that he knows I will attack next. Hahahahaa But that just leaves his butt out in the open for me to poke and pinch........I know I am weird.......that is how I show the man I love how much I love him.   I know he'd much prefer me to be girly and guai guai rest next to him. But I also know he finds my wild playfulness cute, for a while. ahahahaaaa I can play whatever role you want me to play, baby, and you will love me in every way.   I so much look forward to the day we will meet again. And know this time, we don't have to seperate again. I wonder when that day will be. æ°¸é çç¬¬ä¸å¤©.  When I see your brothers with their wives, that they've been together so many years and still so sweet. I know I will be that happy with you too. And I really look forward to it. I really look forward to be the happiest girl in the world.   I love you so much lou gong. And you love me so much too.

      I am so not kidding. I would do anything, anything, to fly to SF right this moment and never come back. If it was the only way to save our relationship. It is so ridiculous, the reasons why I can't do that. Cuz of my braces. Cuz of his job situation. Cuz of...... of what? What is holding me back?

      I lost faith in us.  I doubt our future.  I want to give up. I feel tired.   FOR THE FIRST TIME I don't want to be the one to give in.   It's ridiculous, the stuff we fight about. It's ridiculous, the comments he makes about me. Does he think his words have no effect on me? Does he think I don't take his words seriously? The trouble is, I take them all way too serious. They are all like daggers in my heart. Stabbing me. Reminding me that I am nothing like the type he likes. Reminding me that I am not good enough in every way. Reminding me that, like before, I don't deserve to be loved by the one that I love so deeply.    I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do.

       urlLink      Every night I go to bed, and know that his head is lying on the same pillowcase    I wish I could rest my head on that same pillow case too.....I wish I could wrap my legs around him, rest my head on his shoulder I wish I could feel his hand wrapped around my head        I feel so naive to love him so much. And to want to give everything up for him.....    I hope our feelings would never disappear, granted they will change and evolve over time, but I would be devastated if our souls were not connected in the same direction anymore, if our hearts were not intertwined with each others.....and never to let go.        I am so so so so lucky to have found this kind of love in my life. I will cherish and treasure my pure good luck to be able to experience the kind of love I've always dreamed of. I used to imagine, when I was with my first bf, what my dream  Prince Charming  would say to me, he would tell me how much he loves me, he would tell me he can't live without me. But no man ever said that to me. Until now. Fung said exactly every phrase I secretly wished to hear. He knew what to say, and he said it genuinely. I didn't have to push for anything, I didn't have to hint for anything. He said it straight from his heart. Cuz he felt the same way about me.

      After my 2 hour long chat with Juu, sometimes I wonder what is the definition of the perfect man.  If only fung is a combination of himself and Hei's career ambition.......then he would be the perfect man.......but since he is not, is he worth my time and love?  For me right now, definitely yes.  I would walk anywhere, go through any obstacles with him......he is worth it to me.
