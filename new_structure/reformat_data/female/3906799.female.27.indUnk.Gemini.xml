      Well, here it is. The story I wrote for Gabe to take with him. It's about his life, despite the fact that it so obviously veers into a parallel with another story we know so well... It was an accident, I only realized it did that when I got to the end, by then I just shrugged and went with it. The many references to thunder are references to his name (his real name is not Gabriel lol), his real name is the name for a god of thunder (gads not Thor! shut up!). Without further mumbling...   Hero - A True Story    You want to hear a story? I will tell you one. I could tell you any number of tales, any light and careless thing. But this dusky half-light begs of secrets, aches for weight and age, to satisfy questing hearts. This instrument may be strange yet the tune remains the sameâ¦ itâs a tale youâve heard before.    Minds cast backwards remember the old days, when things were new and simple; when one so young and heart-felt began his long journey. He had a name, to be sure, although I dare not speak it. Some things are best left to those that can bare them aloft.    It was in those days before voice was found that we find our wide-eyed hero to be. Young. Innocent. Little wings. A grand book, waiting to be filled with all the universe had to offer. So hopeful, so blissful, he smelled of summer, laughter and all things lovely and intangible. Brightness shone out with every affection, unbidden, unasked and sadlyâ¦ unnoticed.    As time went on, the heavens in their orbit watched him mature. Mind unfurled. Wings stretched. Testing his mettle against blood and heart-strings. Watchfully pushing and pulling within his bounds. Searching for solid ground. Searching for answers. What he found weighed upon him, not so very long and yet a lifetime of hard truths, blossoming to life beneath haloed brow. They tore at him, cut him, thrashed him in his sleep, never shifting, never silent as they rained down on him night and day. No more denying. No more sightless eyes. No more stillness.    With voice of thunder, âI have found my solid ground. I have found my answers.â With eyes aflame, âI have found myself.â    No welcoming peace as ground shook. No reassuring warmth as the sky cracked in two. Such power in a single voice surely had never been intended for mortal ears. Such stark conviction never made for this devotionâ¦ as the words rolled out, demanding dispute, commanding thought, fierce eyes caught sight of one simple thing amidst the chaos. Soft. White. A single  f e a t h e r         fell.   His eyes followed it down, knowing full well what it meant. Fragile as sugar, sick with choice he turned away from the death of innocence, eyes sliding shut for but a moment as his hands reached up. Blood flowed. Tears fell. As wings were torn. Ripped from solid bone by hands steady with pain. Hands of a man. Hands of a choice. His own.    âIf you are to fall away eventually then I have no need to hold onto you any longer.â    Years. He was smashed against by gods and mortals alike. Railed at. Denied. He bore it all with head held high, knowing the truth, feeling it in the scars across his back. At war with everything ephemeral and false. Locked in battle with the blind and deaf. Shattering them to pieces with the violent quakes of thunder that fell from his gentle lips. Blasphemer. Warrior. Destroyer. He let them come, in wave upon wave, let them blast themselves apart against his steel core, knowing that his biggest battle was yet on the horizon.    An unyielding journey loomed before him, across a great chasm, promising one last battle to fight. Luring him with one final examination, one last whisper of questions drifted to him across the void. He could almost taste it as he looked from the other side, a deep longing, pounding from within.    Who can say what caused that first step to slip, who can say what unseen force was set into motion on the edge of that unforgiving precipice? It was enough for doubt, always just enough for doubt isnât it? Frustrated and heart-sick he sat down, face weary and care-worn as he stared at his hesitant feet.    âIf I could just make it to the other sideâ¦ I could get those answers. I could win that battle.â A soft threat of a storm in the darkness.    âUse your wings.â A voice, unsure of its own weight, next to him.    âMy wings are gone. I tore them from myself, long ago.â He explained to her, the tattered and bruised little girl standing beside him.       âHave you been staring so hard forwards that you cannot see whatâs behind you?â she asked, haunted eyes beneath layers of days. âUse your wings, Voice of Storms.â    He felt them all at once, a balanced weight across his back as he stood up. Glancing back. Eyes grew wide. Mechanism. Metal. Sharp and bright. A frightening combination of machine and man, arching halfway to heavenâs fickle countenance. Wings that could hammer air. Wings that could slice armor. Wings that could blind the rising sun itself. Wings that he made. Wings that made him. His wings.    Head rediscovered its rightful height, as he stood tall against the approaching dawn, heaven retreating overhead, hell trampled underfoot. Wings like a thousand knives spread open, shining bright with passion, easier to bear than air itself. Eyes aflame. Halo ablaze. The sounds of distant battle faltered, drawing a hushed gasp, as a roar of mighty wings thundered forth.    âUse them to bear you home again, star of morning.â    Don't even think about it. It's copywritten. You steal, you die.

      It's ok, kids. I'm awright. Just been a moody lil punk lately. Spikey to the wrong folks. Throwing poop at various people/things on this blog. Pouty lipped, sad eyed skulking about the house. I'm still getting pummeled, rapid-fire, by my muse but I told that slag to chill for a bit while I get my shit together. *gives her musethe bowfingers*   Big thanks to Loki for the long talk this evening. Damn good to talk to you again. I missed my Sargeant Apathy.   *ducks random something lobbed from NJ*   OH! OMG! That leggy bastard, Quinn, finally resolved his issues! Or rather, I have figured out a way to resolve his issues... that doesn't involve killing him off somewhere around Issue 5 lol. It's kinda funky, dunno if you punks that have read Zen are going to go for it. But ya see... Slayde and Quinn need to swap.. something. And yeah I am needing someone to bounce this off of.... any victims?

      Sometimes words just aren't enough...  While I was on the last phone call with Gabriel I found myself struggling to find words to express what I wanted him to know. My entire body was shaking. We were both trying so god damn hard not to lose our shit and we both knew if one of us lost it the other one would. My voice was quaking, alternating between whisper and plead. Jokes fell flat. Laughter was forced. Beneath it all was this weird tremulous silence, gaps between words, between breaths. He made me swear not to fall apart, either in his presence or after the fact. I swore. But this sadness had other plans.  "God, I don't want to say it." he said. "Don't say it." I pleaded. "There has to be another way to say it rather than goodbye." "But it isn't really goodbye even." he pointed out. "Right." I agreed, "But don't say it." "See you soon?" he offered. "See you on the flipside." I corrected. "Yeah that, see you on the flipside, baby."   I'm trying to make sure, trying to make sure I said everything I needed to. I said I loved him. I said I was proud of him. I said I'd miss him. I promised to write. I swore I would not forget. I swore I would not fall in a deep, dark, hole with only my heart ache to keep me company.  And yet... the moment we hung up, I lost it completely. That noise, god, that noise that burst out of me. All I could do was curl up in the fetal position, still clutching my phone, trying desperately not to call him back just to say 'I love you' one more time, body shaking so hard it was like I was convulsing... and I cried. Great big tears. Dreading the long night ahead of me, dreading the panic attacks that I know are coming for me. I swore to keep my chin up...   shitfuckgodamnit   'So, so you think you can tell    Heaven from Hell,    Blue skys from pain.    Can you tell a green field    From a cold steel rail?    A smile from a veil?    Do you think you can tell?       And did they get you to trade    Your heros for ghosts?    Hot ashes for trees?    Hot air for a cool breeze?    Cold comfort for change?    And did you exchange    A walk on part in the war    For a lead role in a cage?       How I wish,    how I wish you were here.    We're just two lost souls    Swimming in a fish bowl,    Year after year,    Running over the same old ground.    What have we found?    The same old fears.    Wish you were here'   'Wish you were here' - Pink Floyd

      This may get me in a whole heap o' trouble with my own gender... but girls... I have some things to say.   That screamy/squealy thing you girls do at random during the course of a conversation has to stop. It is only 'cute' to yourself. Everyone else thinks you're a moron.   Faking orgasms. You use this as some kind of leg-up or source of entertainment. The only person you are harming or one-upping with this? Is yourself.   Being thin-skinned while railing about women being seen as the 'weaker sex'. If you can't see the contradiction in that sentence then I'm afraid there is absolutely no hope for you. The world doesn't have to stop because you started fucking crying. If the tears are genuine? Get a fucking grip on yourself. If they are faked for a) attention b) manipulation or c) drama.... praywe never meet in a dark alley.   Now let's turn our attention fully to emotions and emotional response. Emotions are good, they round us out. Overblown, out of control emotions are bad, they make us look (at best) a fool or (at worst) a victim. Seriously, ladies, pull your shit together, it's embarassing. If you don't know where your emotions come from, what caused them or why you reacted in exactly that way, than you need to seriously assess why you insist on holding up a banner for them.Why defend something you don't even understand? It makes no sense. Use your heads.   Men are *not* from Mars and women are *not* from Venus. We're the same fucking species, get the fuck over yourselves. Don't believe everything the media, your mother or baby jesus told you. You want to be treated like an equal? Why don't you try holding up your end of the table before trying to dump a whole bunch of shit on top of it. You can't reinforce the idea that men and women are oh so different while demanding equality, it will always come out uneven.   Take some fucking responsibility for yourselves. Quit crying about being mistreated, judged, stereotyped, used, abused and take some definitive steps to ensure a different outcome. Don't just sit there and expect everything around you to shift to accomodate you. Get off your ass and do some accomodating yourself, prove to anyone that says otherwise that you are a logical, rational, thinkinghuman being.   Ugh you feminists. At one time, I think you were actually a good thing. But somewhere, somehow the original idea got massacred. With your hard-assed, quick-trigger responses you've managed to gather just as much ire and mockery as the demure, girly girls. You don't have to swing all the way to other side of the spectrum in order to avoid getting lumped in. That's the easy way out, the easy answer. Do you honestly want to live the rest of your life knowing that you chosea pre-packaged path?   Now, some of you girls may think that I am way outta line with all of this. And if choosing to think for myself, dig for my own answers, explore things with rationale/reasonand putting silly contradictions aside is the stamp of 'outcast'? So be it. I love being a woman, but thereare a fewthings I love more. I love being rational. I love being intelligent. I love being responsible for my own actions and reactions.   I love comic books, video games, war movies, gore, violence,foul language, sex,heated arguments and all things dark and threatening. I also love gardening, affection,cooking, pet names,clothes, yoga and doing my fucking nails. I have a ferocious libido that could outstrip an 18 year old boy. I can curse a blue streak with enough skill to make a sailor blush. I have a stronger urge to destroy than I have to nurture. My voice is lower than most guys I know. I have no compulsion to spawn or marry. I can destroy and create in equal measure. I am prone to fits of giggles. I prefer fucking to making love. Honesty to flattery. Alpha males to the 'sensitive' type. These are the things that make me up as a human, not the things that stifle me as a female. So forgive me if I don't reach for the pre-packaged social roles, all of them leave a bad taste in my mouth.   This really wasn't intended to be anything resembling a rant. If I have offended anyone.... perhaps you should ask yourself 'why'?    "Don't start playing games you can't finish.    Don't open doors when you don't know what's waiting.    Don't try to close your hands they're smaller than the rain.    Have you got anything left to say beforeI shoot myself?"    'Superblaster' - Curve    Oh and all men are bastards.... there, now I've pissed everyone off.     If you couldn't tell that was levity... I hope your head falls off.

      Don't worry about that fire you start when you're about 5 years old, it will burn out harmlessly and also teach you once and for all to stop setting Mom's silk flowers on fire.   In the 3rd grade you'll meet your arch nemisis for the next 2 years. Her name is Kelly. Assert yourself the first day by tattooing her face on your 'Dark Crystal' lunchbox. I'm serious, it's metal, smack her hard, repeatedly if you have to, she'll cry and leave you alone after that.   At the ripe old age of 7 you will drown (fully, no vitals)while on a family outing. It will hurt. It will scare the fuck out of you. But themedic will bring you back (remember to thank her).   There's no need to absolutely spaz the fuck out about losing your religion. You'll be 11 years old, trust me, you can handle it.   At 15, be on the lookout for your first boyfriend. You'll know him when you see him, and if you go down that road it will fuck up the next 4 years of your life. Seriously, don't.... just don't. This advice will save you years of wasted time, bad decisions, missed opportunities and one concussion with a side of broken ribs.   At 17 you will meet an Amazonian redhead with a shoe fetish (you'll meet her while working at the lingerie store, right before you get promoted to assistant manager). Listen to everything she says, she won't steer you wrong... ever. When you two move in together downtown make sure you tell her Kazakstan is a 'no go'.   When you're 21 you'll notice this dishy lil number at the coffee shop who draws you flowers, stars, bats, spiders and hearts on top of the foam of your mocha with chocolate syrup. He doesn't do that to anyone else, he obviously digs you, stupid. Get his name. Ask him out. Cause sooner than you realize he will be gone without a trace.   At 23 you will meet a leggy, green eyed, Canadian who will all of a sudden make you believe in happy endings. I cannot stress this enough... RUN. Don't dawdle, don't walk... fucking haul ass. I know you're going to want to argue about this one, I know that everything within you will tell you otherwise but if you don't run away... everything. will. fall. apart. The pain will start inside and rapidly spiral outwards and by the end of it all you will have more scars than a performance artist with a horrendous case of the dropsies. Run like hell itself is on your heels... cause it is.   At 25 you will begin to flirt with the idea of going to college. Do it. Right then. The pull will only get stronger as you age so best to get started on it at that moment.   At 27, remember to write this letter to yourself so you don't fuck up the space time contunuum (causing all matter in the universe to fold in on itself and sending up a chorus of screams from everyone in the world as life as you know it gets stamped out like a damp cigarette).   BTW - Your life will be set to the tune of David Bowie's "Always Crashing In The Same Car"

      Anyone ever pondered that expression? Is there something I'm missing? Are therecults of people around, who run about brandishing bits oftrees at anything that might vaguely resemble fun? Or is it a dated expression? In olden times is that what people did for fun? Shake sticks??? Why just shake sticks? Why not just beat the living hell outta fun... with the sticks. Or poke fun (Gads! Stop it you punny, punnygirl!)with sticks? Were they afraid of fun? Was it a warning gesture? A threatening one?  "Get thee hence, fun! I shall tolerate no more of yourdumbassery!"  ..... The expression also might imply that there is much fun to be had in the very act of shaking sticks. *wanders into the yard, managing to not burst into flames, to grab a stick and get to shaking* .... I'm missing something here... think mine is broken. Cause this?This is fun's cousin, not fun. Silly, to be sure but full blown, pant-wetting fun it is not. This is false advertising!   On we merrily stumble....  I woke up this morning with the strangest compulsion to write (blanches at the mere thought) poetry. What is this new devilry? I am no poet! I can't even manage a short story... brevity is not one of my strong suits. Nonetheless I lurched out of bed and literally fell upon my pen, scribbling away like an impassioned Renfield. Curioser and curioser... I tried to tell myself it wasn't poetry, but it is, I may not have poet blood but I am a rabid fan of poetry. Although it seems even my 'poetry' is afflicted with dark, visceral imagery... so I suppose there is no need to stab myself in the eye with an absynthe spoon just yet....

      Getting ready to batten down the hatches for this weekend. My best friend in the whole wide universe is leaving on Monday for Basic Training. He's in Special Forces, so he's basically going off to learn how to become an unholy nut-kicking badass. My nick for him is Gabriel btw... So yes he is leaving, and the both of us have been dancing around the obvious avalanche of powerful emotions that are going to get stirred up come Sunday. But I'm already feeling it... it feels far too familiar to me, which adds to the instinct to just completely fall apart.   What is this? I know this feeling... but what exactly is this. It's something I just went through but what? Sadness to be sure, sorrow, melancholy... pain...  Oh....  No... not that.. anything but that....  Missing him.... that's what it is. I will miss him like I would miss my ability to speak... like I would miss a lost limb.... like I would miss my heart.   Well... this will be interesting to see if I can actually shoulder that feeling again... so soon. The feeling is so familiar it makes me sick... like my insides are trying to reject themselves.   Ugh....  Well, it's just a warning, there's going to be some really mopey, drag-ass shit showing up here over the next week (possibly longer)... let's hope it doesn't dredge up those demons I've just so recently managed to smite.

      (Read the post entitled 'Halon' before you read this)  Meh... ehehhehehe *sheepish grin*   Shadow and Hell! It's been a looooong time since I've gone all supernova like that. And that was actually the articulate version of what I was feeling... in reality it was so far gone that I couldn't do anything but sit here and literally *shake* with anger.After that Ijustsat here with a wide-eyed, 'caught with your dick in the neighbor's cat' look.   Screw it, it's staying up. It felt good (almost obscenely so) to do it, felt like coming home. Now I've been struck with a bit of a revelation, bare with me. The content of that hellfire and brimstone tantrum is a moot point, the emotion behind it is the thing that has my half melted noodle wandering into more existential areas.   Those of you who have known me for... ohh, say the last 4 years or so, have, sadly, only gotten a tasting of me over the years. Those of you that have known me since god was a boy, no doubt, instantly recognized that explosive napalm shitstorm. That sounded like me years ago, sounded like me when I was younger, moodier, angrier. Back then I didn't even try to hold anything back, didn't even try to temper myself or force perspective into every god damn thing I think or feel. I just blew a gasket, whenever and however I felt one was warranted.   Over the years something has happened to me. I've gotten smarter, wiser, a bit more zen and a lot more tough. I've learned the art of self dissection, introspection. It's a little bit of logic and a whole lot of pain. Over the years I have learned to curb my impulses, especially the emotional quick draws. But somewhere along the way, I've forgotten that I am a fully functioning human being... with a full range of human emotions. I made the mistake of thinking that functioning on pure logic would protect me from anything that could possibly hurt me. I was wrong.   The last year or so of my life has been the hardest time I have ever spent on this god-forsaken shitball called earth. The reasons are purely insular. I struggled with what I was feeling, carefully segregating which emotions and expressions were suitable to let out and which weren't. Somewhere along the way I obviously decided that anger, rage, fury, was something that wasn't to be shown. I swallowed it. Transformed it into something else, something softer like melancholy, bitterness, regret. And I guess once I got going with that whole exercise it became habit.   Funny thing about regret, it is a stand alone emotion. But that fucker is like a virus, once you let it go, even for a little bit, it will dig deep, uproot, stifle, smother and kill all these little parts of you that you most likely didn't even know you had. Like stepping on a kite before it's even left the ground...   I digress...   It suits me. I wear rage well. It is no coincidence that my favorite color is evisceration red. I had a knee jerk reaction to my little blow out earlier, immediately horrified and ashamed by my apparent loss of control. But I couldn't ignore how good it felt, how familiar, how right. Where did my signals get mixed? Where did the wires get crossed? When someone or something steps on you, hurts you, tries to break you, what do you do? Conveniently skip over the obvious reactions? We have certain specific reactions for a reason. I'm not saying all of them are justified or even make sense, there are a lot of really emotionally fucked people in the world. I am not one of them. For a long time I thought I was, I assumed I had baggage because everyone told me that I 'should' have baggage. Everyone told me I should have baggage because they couldn't tolerate the idea that there could ever be anyone without baggage. When did this become acceptable? When did wearing our own scars on our fucking sleeves become 'trendy'? Just because you like the look of your own scars doesn't mean anyone else wants to see them.   Digressing... again...   Point is, I don't want to walk like a three legged dog anymore. Anger is a part of my arsenal, I'm damn well going to use it. And I'm going to enjoy it too, you fuckers. (This is addressed to those fucking fluffy-bunny, anger management, politically correct whores... go lick the spit from the people who have no room for you in their ass.) I'm tired of taking my emotional Prozac, I don't need it, neither do you, you ass, there's no reason to level the entire field of emotions so that they all taste the same, look the same, smell the same. If I feel something it's for a reason. If I feel it strongly then it's for a damn fucking good reason.I'm solid in my own modus operandi... what's your excuse?   In other news....   I went straight back to my writing after I railed about it earlier. If I am hopelessly doomed, married to this damn beast, then I'm at least going to put on my blood-red, fuck-me heels and do some carnage. I may have failed at a good many things in my life but this is not one of them. So come on, bitch.. you know you want me.

      *Warning - If you are looking for happy-fun stuff, have delicatesensibilities or are a non-adult type, little person... get the hell off my internet.*     Still here? Beans. *brief, murderous smilebefore she beginsto breathe fire*   Who the fuck thought it would be 'funny' to drown me with so much creative inspiration that I can't even keep up? It's getting worse each time I upswing. And there is absolutely fuck all I can do about it. This isn't funny anymore, I am no longer having a good time. That luscious wave of creative flow that I've been so blissfully riding the past few months? Has turned into a raging, roiling maelstrom of mind shattering, bone crunching intensity. I can't keep up anymore, I can't utilize it like I did. It's coming too fast and too hard for me to do anything but fucking ping pong around from one work to the other, like a god damn poodle on speed. I can't work at this speed, it's too much. If it keeps up like this I'm going to rattle myself to fucking pieces from the constant amount of G's pushing me.   I was trying to keep up. I was trying to make sense of it all. I was trying to digest andtransmute it like a good little vessel. I have a formidable brain and quick hands, to be sure, but I feel like I'm about to blast apart here. Where's the fucking flow valve?! For fuck's sake!   And all these spectators nearby, eyeballing me from outside, cooing about my 'talent', my 'creativity', my god damned, mother fucking, shit sucking 'gift', as if this affliction of mine is some sort of divine god damned inspiration that should be cherished and nurtured and pet, like ade-fucking-fanged house cat. It's a fucking demon, people! It has claws and teeth and a lust for blood the likes of which even my darkest characterscould only have half-realized wet dreams about. I've tried to tell them, I've shot them warning looks everytime they wax poetic about it, and they think I'm being 'dramatic' when I say that my muse is a fucking monster. "Wow, you're really in flow. Good for you!" What the mother of fuck?! You think this is a fucking choice? You think I 'want' to be like this? It's a god damned compulsion. I'm sick with it.   Somewhere, I've fucked something up. It's not supposed to be like this. Did I break something? Some safety net along the way, some armor I've forgotten to wear? Was it something I said? Something I wished for? Was it all those long years of silence and misery where I longed for my muse to return? I wanted her back, shit yeah, but I didn't want her to come back and skull fuck me with a flaming2 by 4! What the hell was wrong with the system we had before? The one where I could actually still function like a normal fucking human being. I know I'm supposed to just sit back and lether haveher wicked way with me, like a marionette,butI never signed up to be jerked so hard in a billiondifferent directions thatshe dislocates my joints.   This just fucking hurts. All these ideas, words, stories hitting me so fast that I am crippled by them... it hurts, not being able to keep up, not being able to express this, it's making me sick. So much to say, with so much conviction butI bit my tongue in half trying to speak it... where does that leave me?    "now the sun is burning    in deepest space    that's the way things are    through a storm i called you    it fell each day    i didn't get so far    my words get blown away        my lips are moving    if you touch my face    did you hear my scream?    while we were sleeping    i tried to say    even in my dreams    my words get blown away        now the sun is burning    in deepest space    i didn't get so far"    - Blown Away - The Pixies

      (For those of you who have not read my current comic book project, this is a conversation with a few of the characters...)  *Our eyes lock for a moment, across the long cool air of the table. I make sure he sees it this time, my 'resolve' face, before tapping the record button down on the tape recorder.*    Oub - So, Quinn.... if that's your real name. Why don't you start by telling me why you think we're here today.    Quinn - ....    *sound of uncomfortable shifting*    Oub - You know I have better things to do with my time... than to sit here and play 'Who Wants to be a Schizoid?' with you.    Quinn - That's not nice.    Oub - I'm not here to be nice. Nice doesn't seem to work with you these days. If you're having some sort of existential crisis than I am here for you but excluding a complete mental breakdown you have no excuse for your recent behavior.    Quinn - You know I'm not the type....    Oub - I *know* a lot of things, Quinn. Not the least of which is the way you are stressing Zen and Slayde out, popping off these impromptu lines of yours in the middle of a scene.    Quinn - I thought they were good lines...    Oub - They were good lines, just not from you. Do you have a problem with your correct lines? Is there some artisic difference we need to discuss?    Quinn - Sardonic....    *loud slamming noise of my hands on the table*    Oub -Oh I see you like 50 cent words! Have you ever heard of a 'conniption'?   Quinn - Please don't...    *sound of Slayde entering the room*    Quinn - Have I done something wrong?    *hard banging noises as I slam my forehead down on the table repeatedly*    Slayde - Oh , way to go.    Quinn - Is that normal for her to be doing that?    Slayde - Only with you. If she damages that noodle of hers we're all screwed.    *still banging*    *frantic movements*    Quinn - Make her stop.    Slayde - You make her stop! You're the one who made her start it in the first place!    *sound of Zen entering the room. dull sliding noise as a large phone book is positioned between my forehead and the table. sound of Zen leaving.*    *Slayde's obnoxious laughter after the dull thumping stops*    Slayde - Uh oh.    Oub - Quite right. There's only one thing to do now.    *sliding noise of me grabbing the phone book in both hands, mixed with the sound of my rising and walking around the side of the table*    *shuffling noise as Slayde moves well out of the way*    Oub - I'm almost sorry I made you so pretty.    Quinn - What?    *Satisfyingly loud bang as the phone book connects with Quinn's head*    *stunned gasp as he lands on the floor*    Oub - Are you going to behave yourself so I can get Issue 6 out to your adoring fans?    *soft patter of blood dripping from Quinn's nose*    Quinn - But Issue 6 is fine...    *another loud bang, followed by a soft whimper*    Oub - Keep it up, pretty boy. I've got all night...    Slayde - You have pretty good technique for someone that sits around writing all day.    Oub - Thanks. Pray that I never use it on you.    Slayde - I would fight back.    Oub -Then you would be walking into your next scene as a transvestite with pink hair and an obscenely swishy walk.   *sound of Slayde exiting the room quickly*    Oub - Now... where were we?    *sound of tape running out*

      To Whom It May Concern,  It has recently been brought to my attention that you may be slacking on your duties. I realize that you are very busy, you are always very busy, but may I ask what exactly you are busy with? By my estimation you have been moving far too slow for the past twenty years, it occured to me that a major problem could arise from this, but I was trying to be cautiously optimistic.  Getting to the point, where are our flying cars, holodecks, matter arrangers, personal jetpacks, super-heated laser-sighted skull guns, online games that plug directly into our nervous systems and fully automatic Pez dispensers? By my estimation (fifty percent inspiration, fifty percent trash science fiction) all of these things and more should have been invented and mass produced by *at least* the year 2000. I know, because I saw all of this very clearly when I was child. The future had a very distinct look to it and this is not it. And this is the future right now. Actually the future was a couple of years ago, but I was being generous.  In short, you're fired. Please don't steal the stapler or the hole puncher on your way out.  Sincerely,  The little girl with big dreams that still lives somewhere in my head

      This is worthy of note because.. well it's funny for one... and the rest is just pure 'wtf?'  This morning I was awoken by blinding, teeth gnashing pain. Right behind my right shoulderblade, feels like I ripped something. It was not there when I went to bed. It's still there now. Best way I can describe it is, it feels like a throwing star is lodged up and under the back wing of my shoulderblade.  As if that wasn't weird enough...  There was blood all over my neck. I mean all over. Enough to make my palm wet with it when I reached up to investigate. It was fresh, bright red and warm. Get's weirder... there. is. no. cut. anywhere. I checked to see if I had a nosebleed. No. I checked to see if I had bit my tongue or lip. Uh uh. Checked my ears. Nada. Checked my neck for a deep scratch of some sort.... nothing.  Yeah, I dunno either. I have never been known to sleepwalk. I *do* have a history of hypnagogic hallucinations but they are only accompanied by sleep paralysis (night hag), which is the exact opposite of sleep walking. I mean my nocturnal activities are odd but what the mother of fuck?  Here are a fewponderings offered up by the people I told today...  "Did you dream you were in the Matrix?"  "Was there a dead intruder on the floor?"  "Maybe you fought off an attack of night hag."  "You *really* need to get laid."  My bed looked like a train wreck too. I even managed to halfway pull off the fitted sheet. God only knows what the hell happened... I guess we'll never know.  Hell's bells, I'd hate to see what the other guy looked like....

      Yeah, yeah, I know. Grass is always greener right?   I've been in a dry spell with my work for the past 2 weeks or so. Oh I'm still thinking about it non stop, planning, plotting all that good stuff. But the fire of it, the inspiration.. the.. indescribable whatever-ness just hasn't been there. And that, dear friends, is the only thing that makes my writing good. I can have good ideas coming out of my ears, but if I'm not lusting after the story then no one goes home happy. Gads! I digress!   Bout three days ago my 'muse' returned, and with her around I have about as much control as a crack baby with ADD. Don't get me wrong. I love writing. I love everything about it (except technical revisions). And I was overjoyed that my muse came back... but...   I. Am. Worn. Out.  It's been three days. 16 hour days. Writing. Non-stop. When I say non-stop I mean it. I forget to eat, don't hear my phone ring at all, hell I forget to actually go to bed... I'm not even going to tell you how many times I've woken up face first on my keyboard this week. It's like I go into some sort of hyper-focused, super-obsessive trance. You can't break me out of it unless you get really really persistent and then I will either A) pretend that you have my attention but you really don't have fuck all or B) tear your head off and drop kick it. I don't mean to be like this. I've warned everyone I know. And just remember, if you find yourself stabbed in the eye with a pen... it wasn't me that did actually did... it was whatever the hell drives my physical body while my head is elsewhere.  Ideally, I would be able to write with this super intensity for 3 or 4 hours each day. That would rock. But this high as a bloody kite/low as opium withdrawels oscillation of my inspiration? So not cool. (Repeats 'oscillation of my inspiration' out loud because it's a tasty phrase when it falls off the lips.. if a bit silly)  But, no kidding, I am knackered. My muse must be a vampire because I feel a quart low...

      I was cleaning under my bed earlier (had to get the flashlight cause my bed is one of those ancient, four poster, antique jobs that is positively cavernous underneath seeing as it's about3 feet off the ground) and I find spider webs all over the place under there! Good thing I'm not the least bit afraid of spiders or I would have had a coronary. There were even webs inside my old Doc Martins! So I had to go get the vaccuum from hell, it can suck up a small child so spiderwebs were no match for it. But it got me thinking....   My old Docs have been to hell and back. And they look it. Cracked, broken, scuffed, gouged and the poor dears still manage to hold their shit together just fine. Cripes, even the soles are cracked clean through, tread-bare and dirty. They remind me of a battered and bruised street urchin, you know, the ones you *almost* feel sorry for until you realize they are nothing but solid steel underneath. They are 10 years old and spent most of those 10 years on my feet. They've been drug from one end of the continent to the other, through Mexico's heat and Canada's cold. They've been with me through car accidents, hikes, heartbreaks and chases. They've danced on countless dancefloors, run across miles of city streets, stood firm in rain, snow, sleet and even *gasps in horror* sunshine. They were there the first time I fell in love, and the first time I fell out of love. They've sped me away from cops, skipped me through wildflowers, hell they even held me steady through stage fright. They've been been worn under two bridesmaids dresses, despite threats, pleadings and gasps of horror. They've swing danced, belly danced, stage dived; they've done salsa, waltz and cage dancing. They've been used as a weapon in no less than 3 scraps I think of. They've been worn with jeans, long skirts, mini skirts, hell even naked. These are all the reasons I can't get rid of them, not to mention the fact that they feel like a second skin even when I slip them on now. They feel like a part of me, and let's not even make the connections between their battered and bruised but still standing tall state.. and my own.   Hell, I'll probably be buried in them.. although I may want to get them re-soled. God only knows what sort of slippery surfaces have been installed in Hell since I was last there....

      I had a very strange dream last night, incredibly vivid. It didn't make a whole lot of sense (big shock) but I can remember the main themes and symbols:   Snow and very cold weather  Mourning  Funeral  Ghosts  Family  Pearls  Lots of white  Travel by air  ears (yeah, I don't know either)   The overall feel of the dream was one of loss and the cold. I did a lot of wandering, seeming to be the only person off by herself most of the time. There was a strange tone of refined control to the whole thing, which is odd because my family is not like that. The snow and cold weather was out of place as well, none of my family lives in a cold climate. At the funeral proper I was handed a handkerchief lined with pearls, I remember being very interested in this detail within the dream. The only person I interacted with directly in the dream was my grandmother, who died 2 and a half months ago, and whom was also the one the funeral was for. In a way I suppose that made me feel like a ghost as well.   Yeah, not the happiest of dreams. Everything was very somber and cold. In fact the only happy spot was when I had the conversation with my grandmother.   Ok let's take a look at the symbols then...   Snow - repressed feelings, critical, judgemental  Funeral - a need to eliminate the past  Pearls - counsel, wisdom, can also signify the human soul  Ears - listening, clairaudience  Ghost - disconnection  White - white menas A LOT of things. In Eastern cultures it is the color of death and mourning. Hope, faith, purity, perfection, confidence, enlightenment. White alone can indicate a proud, rigid, judgmental immaturity - a âshould beâ, controlling attitude. Soft or pearl white can indicate the gift of prophesy.   Shite, seeing way too many similar themes there... uhhh, moving on....   So I did a bit of writing last night. I figure that sooner or later I'm going to have to learn to work around blocks so I may as well start practicing to see what works. So I thought up a scene, casted it and then had at it. The good news is, Quinn was in the scene and he was acting almost exactly the way he should act. The bad news? Well, Slayde and Zen started kicking the ever loving fuck outta each other. Jesus, am I taking out my hostility on my poor characters? *thinks* No, I wouldn't do that. They do it on their own, right? Slayde and Zen don't like each other 90 percent of the time! It's perfectly natural for them to get into a scrap... right?   What is this I'm feeling? Nervous? What the hell is that? Why am I nervous? I just woke up. And no, before you ask, I haven't (yet) had enough coffee to kill an elephant. I just feel.. ill at ease. Is something coming? Or is it over something in the past? Is it good? Bad? *squirms* I HATE feeling nervous.   I think I want to take up welding. Sybil was a welder, she made all sorts of really kickass things like art and furniture. I think I could do it, I don't mind getting dirty and I like fire (safe and sane, thank you very much).   Thinking about going to school... It's gone past something that I want to do and it's become something I HAVE to do. I can't keep *existing* like this. Crap jobs, living with my folks... ugh. Being single only seems to add to the 'disconnected' feeling I have. Hmmm, there's that word again...

      Hmm, ok, thought about this a bit.  Maybe I should just switch to using this instead of my LJ.  Or rather maybe I should use this for the more interesting parts of my head, since people will actually read this one.  *puts on her pondering face.. which looks remarkably like her vacuous one*  Apologies ahead of time if my posts are all over the place.  If you want structure and coherence from me, read my books.  If you want odd tangents and quite a bit of morbid levity then you're in the right place.  I tend to switch from laid-bare, self inflicted vivisections to just rambling about nothing in particular.  Oh and I talk to the characters in my books sometimes, it helps, trust me.    I haven't been doing much writing in the last week.  Must be one of my gestation periods.  But I have been doing a lot of research.  Yesterday I learned how to break bones, including but not exclusive to: fingers, kneecaps, noses and feet.  I also learned how to properly headbutt, how to do the most damage when hitting someone in the throat and how to effectively burst someone's eardrum.  WTF you may ask do I need to know any of that for?  Well my main heroine in my comic book needs to know these things so that means I need to know them.  I pray I never find myself thankful that I learned any of those things....  I'm still stuck cleaning up my mess on Issue 6.  (Sorry, I know you're waiting for Issue 6... especially since I pulled such a white knuckled cliff hanger on 5!  Mea Culpa!)  I will fix it!  It's all Quinn's fault anyway!  I already had to completely re-write him once, cause he was all wrong.  And now it looks as if I may have to do it again.  What the hell?  I've never had to re-write an entire character before!  What the hell is Quinn's problem?  He should be straight forward yeah?  But no, he's wrong.  I know it.  He knows it.  He needs to be quieter.  Yeah I know he's already really quiet.  But no it has to be done.  Slayde is the mouthy one.  Quinn is the quiet one.  *grabs a scalpel*  Hey, Quinn!  I'm coming for ya, baby.  Did I mention I hate revisions?  I've started to send out feelers for illistrators in town.  We'll see what shakes loose. Everyday I look over artists online, and everyday I am downright *humbled* by what I see.  Truly beautiful stuff.  I wish I could do that.  But the only thing I have are my words.  I can see things all lovely and grand in my head but I can't draw them.  And it's a shame too, cause I have some great ideas floating around up here.  I just need to find a kindred spirit with artistic talent to team up with.  Right now all I'm looking for is character sketches.  Ideally I would like to find someone who enjoys my work to bang out a few character sketches.  Yee gads, that would make my month!  Anyway, I'm going to go glare at Quinn's character profile for a bit... let's hope he feels like sharing today.

      Eheh... you will never believe...  My comp got struck by lightning.  I know, I know, it such a 'my dog ate it' excuse!  But it really happened, serious as a heart attack, kids.  Kinda funny how it happened to... story time.  I was having a nap.  One of those really really good, indulgent ones in the middle of the day.  And I was sleeping really hard, which as most of you know is damn near snowball in hell time for me.  One of those deep, slow, underwater sleepy times where not even dreams can figure out a way to get to you.  You know the ones?  So I'm awoken by the. loudest. clap. of. thunder.  I'm talking crack of bloody doom.  I find myself on the ceiling, nails embedded in the plaster, heart damn near bursting out of my chest.  I release my vantage point and go tearing out onto the sun porch (all glass affair, is just like being outside only no bugs) and there isn't a cloud in the sky.  I blink a moment, crouch down to make sure there isn't one hiding behind the gimongous (it's a word god damn it, I've won at Scrabble with it) oak tree.  Not a cloud in the bluest blue sky.  KABOOM!  Another one crashes, only this time I'm not in the safety of my house and my ears are ringing and for a moment I thought I may have died because of all those shockingly blasphemous things I did in private school.  So I scurry back inside, bewildered and a little bit excited cause it was so bizarre in a David Lynch sorta way.  Then I member that my comp had in fact been up and the electricity is now very much off.  It all comes back up an hour later, and lo and behold, comp is having some sort of seizure.  And that was days ago, just now got the parts and just now got done spelunking to get em in the infernal machine.  All is well....  I've had lots of things I wanted to blather on about here over the past few days but I'll be damned if I can remember what.  And you know, it wasn't really all that bad.  My comp booted up I just couldn't sort out my LAN, so I still had all my files and (thank the gods!   that do not exist  ) my MP3's.  If I had no way to get to my music files I would have gone ass bananas crazy.      Anyway, I was just sitting here a little while ago trying to figure out what has me so uneasy about the current DOA state of my love life.  It's not like I've never been single before, I just have never been single for so long.  Serial monogamy, it's a sickness.  Anyway I've come up with an accurate assessment I think... You know those times, we've all had em, back in the day, you're at a party or something, sitting on a couch with two other folks.  All of a sudden those two people start snogging and you're just sitting there staring down into your rapidly dwindling booze glass feeling oh so out of place and awkward.  That's my love life right now.  Only it's me on one end of the couch and the whole fucking rest of the world on the other, all slobbering happily as I sit and try and look everywhere but there.  And no, I'm not deluding myself that those people are happy or that their relationship ever went further than that drunken fumbling.  I'm just annoyed that I can't be content with being single.      I'm far too broken to be with anyone right now.  I have my good days, where I can smile and make people believe I'm just peachy.  I even have days when I actually do feel peachy, believing it myself.  But it seems to keep coming back to this, empty, wasted feeling.  And I know it's all part of the 'process', I know this is 'normal'.  But excuse me if I don't find a shred of solace in that.  And I can't find solace in the fact that it will 'get better' either.  Right now I'm just concerned that I will make it out the other side with all sorts of shit I never started this journey with.  It's like when you go on a vacation and you come home to unpack and end up pulling out a pink flamingo made entirely of painted elbow macaroni.  "How did I get here?  This is not my beautiful house..."  I don't want to get a year down the road to find that I now have intimacy issues, or trust issues, or murderous impulses that were previously unforeseen.  I've never had trust issues or anything of the kind, thank you.  And I liked it that way.  I don't plan on picking up a new hobby just because my estranged fiance' was much less evolved than I thought he was.  It was an error of judgement, ok?  We all have them.  I dodged a bullet but there's still a whole lot of ballistics evidence all over my back....       "All these people drinking lover's spit     They sit around and clean their face with it     And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit     tied to a night they never met          You know it's time     that we grow old and do some shit     I like it all that way"          'Lover's Spit' - Broken Social Scene         Say, speaking of music.  I highly recommend Broken Social Scene for those of you that dig the indy scene.  It's a collaborative effort between... some folks... and some... other folks   that are all really cool but I can't be buggered to go look it up.    Also been listening to a lot of My Bloody Valentine (sigh, yeah I know I shouldn't), Blonde Redhead (damn you Loki) and the Smiths (good lord!  hide the stabby objects!).      Oh, on a lighter note.  I've spent the last few days (seeing that I may as well have been in a sensory deprivation tank) working on Zen quite a bit.  Quinn has snapped back into his rightful place, he is no longer running amuck through my scenes.  Spank me!  I found his modus operandi!       *chews her lip and sits on her hands to avoid ruining the surprise*

      I got my first letter from Gabe yesterday, a fantasticly long (4 pages) affair handwritten on Army stationary.  *blinks a moment*  I still can't get past that.  Anyway, I had forgotten how much I love letter-writing in the 'old fashioned' way.  Don't oust me from my pixelated tower just yet, I love email, it's fast and efficient but... there's something about actual paper and ink, words on paper that goes above and beyond an email.  Enough about that though.  He is doing well, adjusting.  He is still just experiencing everything with raised eyebrows and wide eyes but not nearly as much as I thought he would.  He's getting into the rhythm of it.  He's already been screamed at by a number of Sargeants (well not him, his barracks) and true to form, has already gotten into a scrap with one of his peers.  Made me laugh, I knew that would happen, he doesn't exactly take shit lying down, and this punk had it coming.  I smiled through the entire reading of the letter, overjoyed that he didn't give me anything to worry about (although I think maybe that is his MO, he's sneaky like that).  I got all the way to the end, happy as pie and then burst into tears cause the last half a page of the letter was sappy and sweet.  Damn, almost made it....  I've recently noticed that this reclusive coccoon I have wrapped myself in over the past year is quite unwilling to be shed so easily.  I can't tell if it's just that I am used to it, or something else, but it's damn near impossible to claw my way out of.  It vexes me, I had thought that once I made up my mind that it would be fairly simple to reverse gears.  I'm so sick of being a hermit, damn it.  It isn't in my nature, I'm a fucking Gemini.  I've systematically removed distractions over the past few months, knowing that I had to if I wanted to get outta this funk, but it's still hard as hell to shrug off.  How the mighty have fallen....  Anyone have some spare tear gas to lob in here?

      I've managed to get a number of revisions done in the past few days, a handful of scenes involving Quinn that had been irking me.  I had to start at the beginning and work forward, plucking scenes out and reworking them over and over until they resembled something closer to what I am going for.  The trick is not to inadvertently screw with the other characters on the way.  Obviously they have to shift a little in order to react properly but I can't have them spinning off into the ozone.  Nor can I have the scenes blossom into something else entirely because that would end up borking the (already written) latter part of the story.  It's a golden spiral situation, I make one small change early on and the whole thing shifts as it spirals out, takes a lot of concentration... did I say concentration?  I meant coffee.  Quinn is in need of another aspect of personality, ASAP.  For the life of me I can't think of what.  My characters usually come to me fully developed already, complete with likes, dislikes, quirks and ambitions.  So now I have Quinn and he's missing something.  For a bit there I thought about taking something that Slayde had and giving it to him but that would just fuck up Slayde and I would cry if I fucked him up, cause he's perfect.  A right bastard, but perfect.   I don't want to spill the beans here by telling you what I am thinking of doing to Quinn.  But be warned, once I settle on it and give it a test write you will most likely have to re-read everything from the beginning.  You *could* just pick up from Issue 6 on but you would notice a jarring track change with Quinn that may not make a whole lot of sense.  I mean, everyone sees him as the father figure, which is soooo not what he is supposed to be.  Quite the opposite in fact.  So it may be a little bit disruptive to your own reading if you pick it up from Issue 6 on.  I really need to stop angsting about all this.  I need to get back to where this is pant-wettingly fun to write.  But in order to do that I need to get Quinn straight, he's been getting on my tits far too long.  When I first started writing this it was absolute excitement to write.  That kind of bouncing up and down, cackling with glee kinda fun.  I need to get back to that, cause that carried me well into Issue 12 (bout 250 pages).  Granted, now I have a fuckup to fix but still...  I have some really crazy shit to write out for the Halloween Issue and yes, it is exciting, yes, it is twisted and yes I can't wait to get to it.  I've also got a new character to introduce, a semi major one... and let's just say, if you thought Zen was a handful, wait til you see this girl.  Ok, I'm done boring you guys.  Just thinking out loud really.  I'm not 'in the now' enough to write anything interesting, apologies.   *mumbles a bit*

      It never bloody fails, as soon as I start to have a semi 'up' day something comes along and knocks me flat on my ass.  Everything was fine, had odd but interesting dreams last night, woke up and immediately got to work on some important revisions I've been putting off forever, everything going rather swimmingly... and then... *insert sound of a balloon deflating*  He Who Shall Not Be Named emailed me.  You kids that know me, know whom I am referring to.  So yeah, he emailed me.  Funny thing is, I didn't even open it.  The mere fact that he emailed me made me fucking furious.  And judging from the title it looks fairly innocuous, perhaps even something funny or pleasant.  Just his name in my inbox sends enough homocidal rage flowing through my veins that I become a danger to both the dead and the living.  *big sigh*  Why does this keep happening?  I thought I was done with this merry go round.  I've only caught my thoughts wandering to him about once a day, a marked improvement.  I spent 8 months brooding, sulking, screaming, crying and hurting over him.  I've gone from one end of the spectrum to the other, a number of times.  Anger is better than agony but not by much... it's still a strong emotion.  I don't want strong emotions towards him anymore.  Or at least, only one strong emotion, I'll take one but I can't handle having multiple intense emotions towards him at the same time.  If I could simply hate him and nothing else, I would be happy.  Problem is, I hate him so much because I still love him.  And this horrible loving and hating with equal intensity is really making me sick.  I despise the fact that I still love him.  Thinking of him with any depth makes my skin crawl.  A month ago I thought I had come to grips with this... whatever it is... and yet here I am.  Why can't I get over this?  How is it that just seeing his name in my inbox has enough power to send me into bloodlust?  I've never hated anyone like this before in my life, never this intensely.  I never understood hate before him.  I was content to ignore him.  That's what I had been doing for the past month.  I didn't tell him off, didn't throw a fit, just simply stopped talking to him and ignored him entirely.  Which is basically what he's done to me for the past 9 months.  Now, all of a sudden, he sends me a god damn email?  Maybe it was an accident....  I know, I'm all over the fucking place.  One of these days I'll get my shit together and all of you can throw a party amongst yourselves so you don't have to hear me oscillate wildly anymore.... I swear to you I hate it just as much as you do.   "Somebody put me back in school   I forget everything I used to know   How to leave the boy behind   Without having to watch him go.      Infidel to die for   What I am doing   Will happen in the morning   When the mirror won't recognize me."     'The Twist' - Metric  Meh.

      Oh my god.  I'm laughing so hard right now but I just had the most horrible nightmare!  Lemme splain....  So I dream I'm running around downtown with an old friend, only downtown isn't exactly downtown.... it's one big carnival.  Not the seedy, smarmy carnivals of today but the old-style kinda carnivals, creepy, spooky, mystifying.  Sensory overload.  So we're ambling about for awhile, and at some point one of her friends joins us in our wanderings.  He seems really nice, kinda quiet and he reminds me of someone only I'm not sure whom.   Next thing I know, I've finally decided it's time to get inked.  Only for some reason my dreaming mind decided to throw out all my careful plans for what I wanted and where it was going.  Back of my calf, some random black scrollwork design.  *shrugs* Yeah, ok, whatever.  So the random guy that seems familiar is the tattoo artist, I'm a little leery since I only found this out about 3 seconds before he starts to ink me.  His first line is quick and graceful, so I figure he seems talented enough and I just sit back and try not grind my teeth in time with the noise.  That's when I notice Vivaldi's Four Seasons is playing, which, might I add, is really NOT the thing you want to hear when you are getting inked.  It was far too exciting, what with the frenetic strings mixing with the annoying buzz of the machine.  I deal.  Go into some kinda odd trance, almost fall asleep (yeah in the dream.... I dunno either).   I get brought back by the burning, seering pain of tattoo over bone.  My shin bone.  I look up to find him tattooing me completely wrong.  Not only was it not the tattoo I specified, but he had inked the majority of my left leg.  I begin to flip out.  He gets up and disappears.  I stare at the tattoo, it's an old-school tattoo (don't get me wrong I love old-school, but not on me) and it runs up and down the entire length of my leg, ankle to thigh, front and back.  I'm absolutely beside myself, too freaked out to really register that I'm in more pain than I should be in... that's when I noticed the blood.  (Yeah, I know tattoos bleed, ffs, but this was *not* normal bleeding)  There's blood coursing from my tattoo, streaming down from my leg, over the chair, onto the floor... and my wayward artist is nowhere to be found.  I sit up and stare at my friend who seems oddly nonplussed about everything.  "Is there supposed to be that much blood?" I asked.  And then I woke up....  Fucking horrifying.  But I started laughing after I woke up.  Yes, I did inspect every inch of my body to make sure it hadn't really happened.  Talk about vivid, I felt it, felt the irritating vibration of the machine, everything.  Yeeeesh, glad it was just a dream.  So yeah, have at it, kids.  If any of you have any idears about what this dream was about, leave me comments.  It's ok to laugh... god knows I am.  Perhaps I shouldn't listen to Diamanda Galas anymore right before going to bed.....
