      Well here we are with only Angela to introduce. She's lovable, playful, our sweet Angela. Her friends call her Angie, and she is the youngest of the four. Like the others, she too grew up on the same street.  Angieâs parents couldnât have children and adopted her when she was three years old. Her parents also middle class. Her dad was a stevedore and her mom a bookkeeper at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Since Angie was an only child, her parentsâ always surrounded her and themselves with the neighborhood kids, throwing these fantastic parties.  Nina was Angelaâs first baby sitter; Claudia at times baby sat for her too! The both became Angieâs older sisters.  Since Angie was adopted, her family resemblance was moot. Her parentsâ were both Irish, with fair hair and skin. Angie had this amazing brown hair; it had both red and blonde highlights. In the summer her blonde showed and during the winter the red came out. Her brown eyes were nearly black, but there was warmth that shown through, her skin tone was darker than her parents were. She was 5â7â, and average weight   Angie had this great personality; many boys and girls were attracted to her. She dated lots of boys and flirted with some of her female friends. Angie would date a guy once maybe twice, but if she ever dated the same guy a third time, we knew she was going to be intimate. Angie broke many hearts.  Angie was a gifted photographer. When she graduated College she went to work for the local photographer. She was taking pictures of weddings and parties. Angie usually got some of those great pictures that you wouldnât see in the wedding album. She had pictures of the groom having sex with the brideâs maid, the bride going down on the best man. There was even a shot of the brideâs mother, who was so intoxicated, did a strip tease on the dais table and kicked over the wedding cake. Angie had all those great picture and the stories to match.   Angie was engaged to this guy named Anthony, whoâs parents owned this catering she was working at. Angie was crazy about him but when the time came to walk down the isle, Angie couldnât do it.  We think that maybe it was all of those awful things she photographed at weddings. They were embedded in her brain. She was really in love with Tony.  A few weeks after she quit her engagement, Angie went down to the Jersey Shore to get a tattoo on her upper right shoulder. It was a small Blue Bird. Under the image were the words âFree Birdâ. Like the song from the group Leonard Syknard. The lyrics âand this bird you never chainâ Angie was to be free.  She left the photography business she was in and started doing freelance writing and photography. Ever wonder why itâs called freelance? Itâs cause you worked for free, hoping to be discovered. Well okay, she did get paid, she had a little more free time than she needed.  This was the time she met Tim. Tim was a photojournalist. He took Angie to all these exotic spots and some nasty third world nations taking photos.   In time they both became engaged. We arenât sure if Angie loved Tim or if it were the places he had taken her. Life was good for Angie then she was free.  Once again she never made that trek down the isle. Tim was crushed. The woman he was crazy about would never be his wife.  It was at this point that Angie decided to remain single and celibate. Well that lasted until she found this adult toy store and bought her first vibrator. âPlaytime alone was never this much fun, she thought.  With this new exploration, she decided that she was going to be bisexual and experiment. Her friends say she is tri-sexual, she will try anything.  She recently set out to find others who are interested in the same type playtime that she enjoys. Angieâs stories now are far more exciting than her doomed weddings.  When we meet for breakfast to discuss things that happened during the week, she makes us hysterical with laughter, the way she uses animated imagery to describe some of her play objects.

      I suppose Kimberly is our far most entertaining woman of the four. Kimberly grew up also in a middle class, blue-collar family. Both her parentsâ were N.Y.C police detectives. Her father was German Irish decent and her mother was Irish. She had two older brothers, one who became a Police officer and the other went into the Fire Department.  Kimberly was a very pretty woman; she was 5â6â Blonde hair and hazel eyes. She was athletically built and would go running 5 miles every morning. It was during her high school years, that she discovered she wasnât like all the other girls. While her friends discussed excitedly how their boyfriends kissed and felt them up, Kimberly would think, âwhy donât I feel this joy? She would blame the boys she dated as not being experienced enough for her own needs.  While her friends developed crushes on teen idols such as David Cassidy, Bobby Sherman and Donny Osmond, Kimberly developed crushes on Marie Osmond, Marsha Brady and all three of the Charlieâs Angels.  Her first same sex relationship didnât happen until college. It was her freshman year. After spending a few hours at the local tavern, Kimberly and her roommates went back to their dorm room, where they ended up smoking a little marijuana and playing truth or dare.  Needless to say what happens when you drink and smoke and add in a little dare. It was Kimberlyâs turn to answer a truth or perform the dare. Her truth question was, â how many guys did you give fellatios to and did you swallow or spit?â Kimberlyâs heart began racing, she was overcome will nausea and thought she would vomit. She was embarrassed to say that she never was with a guy like that, but the thought of making up this sexual act grossed her out. Her other option the dare was to make-out with her roommate named Sherry.   Sherri was one those freaky chicks,( no offense to anyone who resembles this) she was into punk rock wore her hair half shaven while the remainder of her hair was dyed orange. She was pierced all over, before it became popular like today. Kimberly opted for making out with Sherry.  Kimberly was very nervous; five other girls were watching her. Sherry appeared very calm and quite casual, perhaps having experienced same sex relations many times over.   Kimberly placed her hands on Sherryâs shoulders. They were both on their knees at the time. Kimberly closed her eyes, she could feel her heart beating loudly in her ears. The butterflies in her stomach were breaking from their cocoon. Kimberly pressed her lips slightly against Sherryâs, but Sherryâs lips were slightly apart allowing Kimberlyâs lips to feel her tongue. Sherry pulled Kimberly closer into her and they both tumbled to the floor. The kiss became deeper and more passionate. Their hands began exploring one anotherâs bodies. One by one the girls left the room, leaving Kimberly and Sherry to share the most perfect night. It was the springtime of Kimberlyâs life. She was reborn. Kimberly now knew she wasnât different from the other girls, she too had those feelings, only not for guys but for women.  She spent the next few years in casual and one-nightstand relationships. She felt liberated, she was out and loving it.  The hardest time for her was telling her family. Her mother kept saying itâs only a phase you will grow out of it. Kimmy knew it wasnât a phase but if that thought made her mother more accepting, than let her think that. Her brothers on the other hand were well receptive to the fact their baby sister was a lesbian. âI think itâs a guy thingâ. Kimâs dad was unhappy about this, and didnât look at Kimberly for months. âI didnât raise some degenerate pervert,â he yelled.  It wasnât until Kimâs dadâs partner was shot and killed during an undercover sting months later; that made him realize life was to short and something to be cherished. He welcomed his daughter back into his life and accepted her lifestyle.  Kimberly had a four-year monogamous relationship with another nurse she met in the hospital she worked for. Kimberly was working in Geriatrics while her lover Rachel was working in Pediatrics.  Together they lived as any married couple would. Spending all of their free time together, making sure their schedules didnât conflict. Kimberly was very happy that she had this in her life.  One day a bomb was dropped, Rachel decided she wasnât really a gay woman and that she was going to marry a former boyfriend. She told Kimberly that after these four fabulous years, she wanted to have her own family.  Kimberly was devastated. She was heading down a road of deep depression, but fortunately for her loving friends, Kimberly was getting lots of emotional support to keep her from sinking.    Kimberly went back to school to receive her masterâs degree and became supervising nurse in charge of Maternity. She dates on and off but hasnât been in any serious relationship in some time. She is very interested in Nina though. Kim thinksâ one day Nina will realize that she too is a lesbian and that they will live happily ever afterâ.

      Let's talk about Claudia. Now here is an interesting woman. Claudia grew up in a blue-collar family. Her father was of Italian decent and her mother was Jewish. She was the oldest child out of three. There was a younger brother and sister.    Claudia was pretty fast with the boys, dating back to Junior High School. She had an abortion by the time she was 15. Claudia's looks weren't anything outstanding; she had dirty blonde hair and brown eyes. She reached the height of 5'5". She had this hour glass figure and large breast. The boys would drool when walked by.    Claudia liked dating boys with sports cars, she also liked the cuisine (Tony Manaro Type from Saturday Night Fever) with their daddy's caddyâs. When Claudia was into having sex in the back seat of her boyfriends cars, David Berkowitz, aka (Son of Sam) was out there shooting couples parked in make out areas all over the city. This was now time that Claudia was introduced to cheap motel rooms, you know with hourly rates. Claudia also developed an insatiable thirst for kinky sex. She read many books on BDSM and it was a real turn on for her to tie you up and tickle you.    She married her first husband after she graduated college. She became a teacher that same year. Claudia taught Physical and Health Education to High School children. Her friends teased her, saying she liked to watch the young boys squirm in their seats when they discussed sexual intercourse.    Claudia's first husband Johnny was a stockbroker. Johnny was involved with insider trading and always made lots of money. Johnny was also into physical fitness and healthy eating, which is why everyone was shocked when he died one morning eating his breakfast. Claudia was suspected of foul play. There were light bruises on Johnnyâs wrists, neck and rib area. There were scratches, tiny burns that appeared to be from candle drippings and welts. When the autopsy was completed the cause of death was Instant Cardiac Death. Claudia stood to inherit lots of insurance money. She was married less than a year.      After a year of mourning Claudia met Michael. Michael was a professional Exterminator. No, not a hit man, but a professional killer of bugs and rodents.    They bought a house together in a private community in Queens, N.Y. The house was located a few blocks from the ocean, a beautiful setting for the happy newlyweds. The previous owners however allowed the yard to be over run with weeds, which caused a heavy population of mosquitoâs and other garden insects.    One afternoon while Claudia was at work, Michael was using an undiluted Mathalthan. To rid the insects quickly, so they can begin the removal of weeds right away. Later that afternoon upon Claudiaâs return home from work, there was Michael lying on the kitchen floor, one his back like a dead water bug. Once again Claudia was suspected in the mysterious death of her 2nd husband, who also held a very nice insurance policy. The autopsy revealed high levels of pesticide in his blood. And the suspicious bruising and marks that her first husband had. After the crime scene investigators completed their investigation of the area, it was concluded that Michael left the windows open while spraying the pesticide, contaminating his lunch, which was found three quarters eaten on the counter. Not very professional for a professional, was it now? Cause of death Accidental Poisoning. They were only married 3 months.    Itâs been several years since Claudia pursued any relationship.

       Chapter2    Nina, Claudia and Kimberly grew up together in the same Brooklyn neighborhood. They have always kept in touch, and once a year they reunited at the neighborhoods annual block party. Angie too grew up on the same block, but was later reacquainted with them when she rented out an apartment from Nina and her ex-spouse #2.    Nina grew up in a large Italian family. She was one of six kids. Her parents were born in Italy and spoke that broken English. "Heya youa get offa my stoopa", go playa ball in your owna homa". When Nina's mom came out with her big wooden spoon, you ran like hell.  Nina was the middle child and only girl. Perhaps this is why she wasn't so feminine. Nina was always pretty, light brown hair, dark brown eyes, and olive skin. She was tall, 5'8"and athletically built. She played sports throughout High School.  After graduating High School, Nina worked with her dad and brothers in their family owned cement business. It was hard for Nina to meet men back then. I mean, how many men date women working in cement?? Nina was very pretty, but the jumpsuit, dusty skin and hair, well it's just not very lady like.  Nina met her first husband totally by accident. It was her first day delivering cement. She drove to the address 3600 Ocean Avenue, but it should have been 3600 Ocean Parkway. 3600 Ocean Avenue was a small pizza place. A man named Richie owned the shop. When Richie met Nina it was love at first sight.  Richie was an old fashioned type of guy; he wanted Nina to give up her construction boots for an apron. She would eventually work for Richie, a few months after theyâve met..  She prepared the sauce and breaded cutlets in the back. Six months after they met, they got married. Once they married; he wanted her home and making babies. Nina was more of the outdoor adventurous type. She packed her bags and left three months into their marriage. "No man will dictate to me, when to have babies".  Her second husband worked for the Telephone Company. He was a pole climber. Jim was a handsome man, his skin always tan from being exposed to the sunlight. He too wanted her home to raise a family, that's when Nina left. This time she was married only Seven weeks .  Now I'm not really sure, but some say Nina couldn't have kids and rather then confront the issue she walked away. Others say she was a frigid bitch who didn't like sex. Then there is Kimmy, our much-loved lesbian nurse, she swears Nina is gay and she should get her hand on the door knob and come out of the closet.  For now I'm just going to observe our dearest Nina. You all will know about her as soon as I do.

       This is a story about four single friends from the city. Perhaps their stories and lives are familiar. They will share personal and intimate details of their entire lives weekly.  Meet Claudia, she is 41 years old and a N.Y.C. High School teacher. She was married twice and widowed twice. Both husbands died of mysterious circumstances, but after the autopsies were completed, the deaths were listed as natural causes. Claudia was nicknamed , "Black Widow", by her friends. They never called her that to her face.... Perhaps Claudia's desire for rough sex was the reason for the demise of her spouses.  Next meet Nina. She is 44 divorced twice . She recently started working for those package delivery services. You know the company that wears those cute brown uniforms. Looking at Nina you would think she was some Butch Lesbian. Her ruggedness and choice of careers might lead you to think she was. Her former job was in construction. She had an accident and went out on disability for a few months. She needed to get back to work so she thought delivering packages was a safer job.  Now meet Kimberly. She is 38 and a nurse in the maternity ward. Kimberly is also gay, out and proud. Ironic how she works with more pussy than she actually gets. Kimberly has been without a partner for a year. Her last partner of four years left her to marry a man.  Kimberly is convinced that Nina is also gay. Kimberly will stop at nothing ,trying to convince Nina that she is a lesbian.    Last but not least we have Angela. They call her Angie. She has recently turned 30 and is a freelance writer and freelance photographer . Did you ever wonder why they call it freelance??? She basically works for free trying to be discovered.  Angie was engaged twice, but never made it to the alter. She always got cold feet. She recently decided that she is going to experiment sexually. She now says she is Bi curious , her friends say she will just buy (bi) anything.  Angie and Kimberly are willing to share their experiences in the usage of their adult toys, Stating, " you don't need a man when you have the Energizer".    Every Sunday morning the girls meet for breakfast at this crappy diner to recap their weeks adventures around this shitty city.
