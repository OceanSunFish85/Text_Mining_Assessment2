      alice alice  alice the caterpillar was ever so wise. what a question...a question whose circle smoke surrounds and confuses.  a haze of unanswered thoughts.  so many thoughts that loop into an eternity of patented single word responses.  i am woman; daughter; wife; artist; dreamer; lover... and what do any of those single words actually say- they say mockingly directly to the source "who are you?"

       when the mouth is silent, why does the mind circle things that are mundane like a vulture?    point in case:    i was sun bathing on my rooftop yesterday, and it became a matter of great urgency to catalog the past ten new years eve's chronologically.    mind you this was no small task.    obviouslya pressing issuethat was worthy of the better part of two hours of "relaxation".    so i proceeded....        let's see- i know that two were spent in new york city, two in chicago, two in d.c., and there was that one on the beach in maryland....        let'sstart with the two's shall we.        new york    yes, yes, one was with a group of friends out at some club down in soho...that was fun.    the other was more intimate- only three of us out to an early dinner, then a neighborhood bar on the upper west side.    ok- i've got it.     the threesome was post friend fall out  -    placing it some years  after  the inaugural apple dropping group outing in the late nineties.    glad that one's straightened out...        onto chicago        (this one got complex.)    both new year's in chicago were spent at local restaurants (similarities from the onset)    one,the clock struck twelve while dancing ata club in the loop...    the other, the magic hour hit whileplaying kloodlewith friends in front of afireplace.    and to make things evenmore difficult to figure out-    i was fairly sure that these two were consecutive.    (for this one i had to lap upas much of my brain as i could- whichwasn't easy since the heat had already melted it down and it was seeping through the cracks in my lawn chair)    then-    it hit me.    the reason that Magnolia's (one of the restaurants)was such a special outing- was because we had just moved to thearea....    GENIUS!    - predating it  to the second restaurant in the same area!     whew.     that was some thinking.....    it really is a good thing i love to speak.
