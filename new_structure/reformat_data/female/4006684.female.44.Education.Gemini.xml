      This is a new one for me. I've taken a class in the art of creating Complex Cloth. My teacher creates wonderful silk scarves, purses, hats, wall hangings and table coverings using her products. When the class was offered I couldn't resist.  We spent 4 Saturday mornings dying fabrics, layer upon layer, and then embellishing the fabrics in applications of paint, glitter, glue. I have yet to try the discharge paste which we were warned would smell like an open sewer. Yuck! But that will take out color in designate areas for effect.  I've found Jane Dunnewold's book called Complex Cloth and her wonderful examples and directions. I've also discovered Dharma Trading and their wonderful collections of dyes, fabrics and ready made white clothing just waiting for the magic. And then there is the good old local WalMart where they carry many acrylic paints, stencils, brushes and stamps just waiting to be put to use. Why can't I ever leave that store without spending too much money?  I've been taking good notes in class, so next post will have colors by name and what's been added. Pictures will be here when the 4 pieces I started are complete. I will truly mourn the passing of this summer!

      We know a little girl who is celebrating a birthday soon - my husband's grand-daughter. She has dark coloring and is just beautiful. So when I spotted Debbie Bliss' cotton angora yarn made up in that Lola sweater, I had to make it. We chose a lucious periwinkle for the color. Anyone who sees me knitting it has to touch it. As the piece gets bigger, the angora haze shows more and more. What luxury. I keep knitting and knitting, almost hating to put it down at all.   Daughter's rollneck sweater is completed: Hooray! I look forward to seeing her wear it in the fall.  I replaced the beads which had fallen off my felted purse. Pesky, expensive things. I used a different kind of fiber to attach them and tied them individually this time. So far, so good. I went to the yarn shop today with 3 friends, very novice knitters, who want me to teach them how to make the purse. Fun trip but I hope I'm up to the instruction. It was an easy pattern, but I've never shown anyone how to knit before.  I'm starting to plan some Christmas knitting. Late for me, but I'm a newly regenerated knitter. Finishing that purse in 2 days was very empowering. Now that I've skipped around from one topic to another and displayed the state ofmy tired and scattered brain, I believe I will take my Debbie Bliss project to bed with me!

      Hooray! I have all but finished my daughter's chianti Brown Sheep yarn roll neck sweater. It has been lovely yarn to work with and the pattern is wonderful brainless knitting from Yankee knitting. I brought it along on our blueberry picking extravaganza Friday, but was unable to go beyond sewing the pieces together as I had not brought along the short, circular #5 needle to use in completing the neck edge. Upon returning home I was determined to finish it. But there were 57 pounds of berries to attend to. (My husband is a fanatic about antioxidants, read: blueberries!). So I knitted in between scooping berries into plactic freezer bags. Thank goodness we don't do anything elaborate with them. By the time I had finished I was dizzy with fatigue and so didn't attempt to weave in the loose ends.   Maybe for my next car ride, when I also plan to start my second felted bag. I can use the leftover yarn from Nicole's sweater and I'm itching to start it. I carried the first one I made today for the first time today and it feels great to lower your hand inside to fish out some necessity. It's funny that in my other creative pursuits I almost never repeat creations. But with knitting, when I find something I like, I make it more than once. I think I've made5 of those rollnecks! Maybe it has something to do with my lack of confidence in my knitting compared to other things. I just finished reading the Knitting Sutra by Susan G. Lydon and sheasked herselfsomething that hit homewith me. I've been knitting since I was a little girl, so why don't I consider myself an accomplished knitter?I need to strive,as she did, to really master the art of knitting and not shrink from the hard patterns.   Today when the instructor of my complex cloth class saw the purse she said she thought I should teach a class in felting. Immediately I thought ofhow I lack expertise. Well, it's time I gained some, or the self recognition of what I already have!

      Who but a knitter would prefer a cool, damp summer? I've capitalized on this season's weather to knit past spring and tackle a felted, beaded purse. It came from the book Knit One, Felt Too which I borrowed from the library, then fell in love with and just had to have a copy of my own. It's full of quick and easy projects which of course are all felted. My purse was knitted using Brown Sheep yarn in wool and mohair. I finished it in 2 days which is completely out of character for me, but it was addictive. Double strands made it move quickly and I enjoyed using one of my circular needles from a vintage kit I recently purchased. Not being a beader, I don't know how well the beads will stay on, but time will tell! I hope to post pictures soon.

      I've finished my second felted purse and am about to start on my third!  I've almost completed the luscious cotton angora little girl's sweater as well.  Just the ribbing around the front remains.  What a pleasure that has been to work on!  That's a photo to post for another day.  I'm afraid I've found another obsession.  That seems to be the theme for this summer.  I've always wanted to spin yarn and decided to start doing just that.  I've got a small amount of roving, a drop spindle and a fabulous new spinning wheel.  After watching the video and trying the wheel, it was a bit fast for this beginner, so I started with the spindle.  I have a few feet of rather uneven yarn, but it did seem to get more smooth as I spun, so I'm hopeful.  I've located a local guild and plan to contact the people involved and see about joining or at least finding a class.  How much fun can I have this summer?  Well, since it's nearing the end, I may just have to let it spill over into the fall!
