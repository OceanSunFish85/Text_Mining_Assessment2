                     Lord,          I praise you for all the freedom you've given us in  Australia. Thank you for letting us worship and live our lives for you freely,  without major persecution.          I pray for our brothers and sisters overseas who  are facing suffering because they are your children, Lord. Help them in times of  trouble, encourage and strengthen them. As Ramadan approaches, I pray that those  believers who will go through even more persecution are surrounded by your love,  and they stand firm in their faith.           Father I pray for Daniel, who's not feeling well,  and anybody else who is sick. May you place your healing hand upon us, and help  us to recover quickly, so that we use our gift of health to serve you  fully.          For those of us at school, I pray that we still  make time for you. I pray that we see you as our Father in Heaven who will  always be there for us, when we're upset, stressed, tired and just sick of it  all. And you'll never get sick of listening to us. How amazing you are, God!!! :  )          in Jesus' name,  Amen

      Our Father in Heaven,   Thank you for the trials and tribulations in life. Strengthen us; encourage us; and give us the ability to endure. Let our faith remain strong through every challenge. Generous and gracious God, we ask that when we need help, we will not hesitate to come to you in prayer.       Lord, remove every doubt in our minds, and let us be certain and decided. Do not let us become like a wave in the sea that is blown about by the wind. We pray all these things that we might better serve You, mighty God.      In Jesus' most precious name, Amen         [Read James 1:2-8 for encouragement in hard times ^-^]

      But despite her best efforts. Marion was soon surrounded by a cloud that burnt like fire. Marion screamed as the flesh melted from her bones and fell to the untouched ground. Soon, Marion was nothing but a pile of ragged bone fragments.

      Marion raged against the glowing green walls of her prison. Nothing she did helped, and she was weakening fast. Marion sat down, despairing. "Hello?" Marion turned around and saw someone sitting down a short distance away. Hope rose within her. "Hello?" Marion's hope vanished as she gazed on the source of the voice. A small child. Rising past her disapointment and despair, Marion moved closer. "Hello, little boy, what's your name?" "Joshua, I feed on despair." "My name's Marion. I feed on death." "Then you will fade. Everyone except me does, because I feed on their despair as they fade." Marion raised her dagger, once Tittanya's, and struck. "Then your death should bring me lots of strength.  Tittanya jumped as the green stone suddenly dimmed. Damien cursed and threw the stone away. "RUN!!! If she has done what I think, she will have released a force that cannot be matched even by her!"  Marion jumped from the stone and ran from the cloud behind her. "SHIT!!!"

      Tittanya started to run towards the sound. "I'll be buggered before I let somebody else kill her!" She wispered to herself. When she reached Marion, she was huddled among the forms, wimpering as the prodded her with their shard talons. "Get away from her!" She screamed, "She's  mine !" Still running forward, Tittanya pointed the strange green stone at the group of creatures surrounding her enemy. They all collapsed. "What a fucking anti-climax, huh?" Said Damien from behind her. "No shit." She replied as she bent down to check on Marion. "She won't get up again, she's utterly dead. That's what the stone was for. "Oh, right. Well, can we get out of here?" And they walked towards the setting sun.

      "What were those... things ?" Tittanya asked when she had regained the energy to speak. Damien hushed her. "Promise me to relax and try to recover, and I'll explain everything. You must rest." Tittanya nodded gently in reply. Though she disagreed with his logic, she dared not object. Her curiousity silenced her. "Tittanya," Damien began, "you once said that your vendetta with Marion must cease- that only one could survive." He paused to allow Tittanya time to drink it in. "In the bar..." "Yes. It is not a simple matter," he continued, sighing. "Everything has spiralled out of control because I intervened. Do not ask how, but you and Marion  must  have a   Final Fight, else anarchy ensue. One of you- and I sincerely hope it to be Marion- must die in the hands of the other." These words reminded Tittanya, who shot up like a bolt of lightning. "Marion's still in danger!" she exclaimed. "She will not die yet." Damien's words were so plain and emotionless, raising a slight fury in Tittanya. "what's that supposed to mean?" she questioned. "We need to rescue her now! You said yourself that she musn't die yet." "I only want you to be fresh for your battle against her. I will save her when she is nearing death," he promised. "Then you can finish her off easily." "Can you really risk that? What if you're too late?" At that exact moment, Marion's shrill voice could be heard worlds away. It was a cry fer help.

      Marion was scared. Just because she could not die did not mean she didn't feel pain. The creatures that surrounded her in her corner made her blood as ice. Moving Tittanya's dagger in front of her, Marion desperately tried to think of a plan.  Tittanya fared little better than Marion, having no weapon other than the stone. it held them off, but only when directed straight at one. "Damien." Tittanya's voice was barely a wisper. As one of the creatures managed to circle her and grab the back of her neck, Tittanya screamed to the only other person she could think of: "MARION!!!"  Marion heard the cry and hesitated long enough that she was disarmed. "TITTANYA!!!"  Damien raised his head as he heard the exchange. "Damn it all!" He passed through the worlds and grabed Tittanya. She was weak, but he heard her: "Got to save Marion, got to fight creatures." "Shhh..." Damien said tenderly, "Yes, we'll help her and get her help against these creatures, because none must interfere with your Final Fight."

       Meanwhile, Tittanya stood still like an ice sculpture, the green gem glowing in her hand. She did not move. She simply stared vacantly. The night was coming to an end as the sun peeped up from the clouds. Tittanya was roused by the rooster crow.   "Damien, what did I do?" she sighed, crompling to the ground. A glistening tear slid down her pale cheek.   The sight of a long lost friend had invoked so many memeories. It was all bittersweet. He had died to save her life, but he had not realised at the time that she couldn't live without him.   Drying her eyes, she felt her own being warming. It was as if she had been frozen, unfeeling, for so long. Too long.   Again, Tittanya fingered the crystal. There was no doubt that Damien had wanted to help her in her battle against Marion. And she had been given the green stone.   "Why?" she wondered. "How will this thing save me?"   Suddenly, Tittanya felt a burning need to see Damien again. She had been stupid to turn him away and think that she could handle this on her own. What would he be doing right now, thinking right now?      A cold hand rested on Tittanya's shoulder, and her blood froze to icicles.

       Fuzzy Rememberance Scene!   Damien ran along the golden sands, the boys hard on his heels, Tittanya just ahead of him. "Come on Damien, we've already started, why not let us finish with her?" The leader of the boys yelled. Damien was about to reply when a sudden weight from behind brought him to his knees. "Run Tittanya! Don't let them catch you!" As he said this, he rolled over, pushing himself into the path of the other two boys. "Bastard!" Swore the one who had tackled him. "You're gonna pay for that!" The two others pulled daggers from within their jackets. "Slice him, we don't want him to inspire others to delay us, do we?" The leader gave Damien a nasty smile as a blade was drawn across his throat.  In his own time, Damien stood and moved off to find Tittanya and set things right.

       Damien was angry as he left Tittanya. He had been her friend all along. Sure, he had helped Marion once, but that didn't mean he wasn't helping Tittanya. And now, when he finally had the power to help her diectly, she spurns him.  Damien's anger boiled out of him and into the surrounding landscape. Lightning flashed and earth rumbled. "How is she meant to kill a vampire who is alive, not even undead, without the power of the dead behind her? Doesn't she realize what she's up against? Marion is a vampire who endures sunlight, who feeds on death, is fuelled by Death and is protected from death by Death. Can't she abandon her pride long enough to realize that she needs the help of one of the dead, to accept her weaknesses long enough to stay alive?" Damien's anger suddenly turned to grief and a river of salty water surrounded him. "Tittanya, I'm sorry." His voice was a bare wisper. "I shouldn't have let them do it, but I died because of it and now you won't let me repay the debt. Can't you trust me enough to let me bring you here, so you can learn how to rid the world of Marion? I'm sorry." Damien stayed on his island surrounded by the river of his grief, remembering what he did to warrent such a strong rejection from Tittanya.

       Tittanya stood in his path. She would not budge. "Come on, Tittanya, let's go, " he coerced. But she was adament. "No, Damien. Not until you tell me what is going on here!" she demanded. "Well, a vampiress is after you and trying to kill you with your own dagger. Satisfied?" he replied curtly. "I know that!" she cried. "But what I don't know is why you're here and what you intend to do to me." "I'm here to take your soul to a better place- where you can find peace." "Why?" she interupted. "Why do you bother to show up after so long and expect a friendly welcome?" He placed a firm hand on her shoulder. "Tittanya- I died but returned for the sole reason of saving your life. Had I not intervened, Marion would have claimed it. Please understand this, and stop looking on me as an enemy. I'm your friend."   She waved his smile away. "No, Damien," she replied, "I have no friends because I don't  need  anyone's help."   "Tittanya..."   "I don't need you!" she screamed. The surreal setting melted away, along with Damien. Before he disappeared, he handed her her a radiating green stone.      And Tittanya was left outside the pub again.

      Damn, stabbed twice in the chest in as many hours. At least this time she didn't have a heart to stab. Marion stopped, panting and confused. Why was the person who had helped her before helping Tittanya now? Marion looked at Tittanya's dagger, hers now. She would have to learn how to use it. Then she realised she had left her heart back there.  Damien picked up Marion's heart and smiled. Her greatest strength was her greatest weakness. He had her greatest strength. "Come, Tittanya, let us find Marion."

      "I am here to take your soul to a place of peace." Damien reached out to Tittanya. "No, Iwant to stay." Tittanya's lip trembled. "Of course you do." Marion's voice came from behind her. "No, she will be coming with me." Damien lunged at Marion, a dagger appearing in his hand. Marion backed up, slashig the air with her own dagger. Suddenly she felt a cold something between her ribs. Startled, she looked down, and saw the ornate handle of Damien's dagger quivering in her chest. "Bastard!" She screamed as he stepped away. "Well yes, but that's beside the point." Damien sighed, "I've always wanted to say that." Marion turned away from his smiling face, and ran as fast as she could.

       It seemed as though Marion would avenge her sister's death after the wild persuit. The persuer landed on the roof, following her prey. Tittanya now seemed so weak. So futile.   "You can'e escape me," Marion called. There was a heavy silence, disturbed only by the howling wind.   Tittanya pushed her vibrant hair behind her face. "What are you going to do, Marion? Kill me? Tell me, girl- what good will it do?"   "You always questioned everything... Why ask questions? Why not simply accept things as they are?" Marion was shoked to find the words of the man in white coming from her own lips.   Even more astonished was Tittanya. It was eerie to hear the exact words of her late friend. Eerie like a phantom of the past finally catching up to her.   "Damien..." she coughed, before dropping backwards off the roof.      Tittanya had no recollection of falling. She awoke to find a long-haired youth looking over her. Damien.   She supressed the emotions flooding her mind, and said passively, "What are you doing back again?"   "You've changed, Tittanya," the man replied. "Three years ago you would have greeted a friend with a smile if not an embrace. I see the world has hardened you. Where's the Tittanya I knew?"   "Yon  were  my friend. Not anymore. How can you be?- you're dead!" Tittanya cried, her eyes betraying her feelings. "The world has not altered me. I changed the day you left me in this world. Damien, why are you here?"

      Soon she heardfootsteps, slow and steady like a heart beat. She turned, and her own heart beat sped up to twice the speed of the footsteps. With tensed muscles, she raised one of her arms. Just as the sound turned the corner, Tittanya threw the tiny stud. The police man she had just hit in the jugular screamed, and she absorbed the wash of fear he released. "Your aim is impressive, but you made the mistake of giving me his death. Though an unintentional gift, I thank you."  Tittanya had spun at the first word, throwing arm poised. The sight that greeted her made her hesitate. Marion leant against the wall, holding her own heart with Tittanya's knife sheathed in it. Marion found the direction of Tittanya's gaze and commented, "An Interesting symbol, the pierced heart. A symbol of love, of a broken heart." At that, Tittanya threw remaining stud. Her trembling body betrayed her, making her miss the jugular. Marion removed the silver jewelery from her cheek and inspected it curiously. then she laughed. "Ah, Tittanya. Silver does not affect me, for I am not dead. If I were, why do you think I would need the death of those such as the policeman? I am protected from death by Death, and Death has power over everything.â âExept Immortals.â âYou are not Immortal, Tittanya.â As she once again harrnessed her terror, preparing to jump, Tittanya wondered how Marion and her own positions and personalities had become so confused. Didnât she used to be the implacable one? She thought she heard a soft whisper as she landed on the roof, a whisper that sent a shiver down her spine.  âFor my sister.â It was then that Tittanya realised she should have killed Marion first.

      Tittanya's heart pounded. Marion was dead, that explained a lot. After a while, Tittanya slowed. She heard no footsteps, only silence. "How do I stop her?" Tittanya searched her mind. Then it came to her. Silver. That killed supernatural creatures. Pulling out her earings, Tittanya sat down to wait.

       "Your right, Tittanya, hearts are stupid, and weak. Why else do you think that your pittiful dagger could pemetrate mine?" Tittanya shreiked, jumped up and began to run. After only a few steps, she stopped and turned around. In her eyes was the bane of Marion's own life. Curiosity. "You needn't ask, I'll tell you anyway." Marion stood up, gracious even past the gaping hole in her chest. "You didn't realize, did you, that when you killed my sister, you killed my heart. It was dead, lifeless, before you stabbed it." Tittanya dropped the knife she was still holding, the clattering of metal against concrete drowning out the dull thud of meat landing. Marion laughed and picked up the heart that had left a bloody smear to her feet. "Are you hungry, or just terrified? Heart meat is considered a delicassy in some parts." The evil in Tittanya's eyes was somehow muted, making her more alluring than before, more human, more accessible. Then she spoke, breaking one spell while weaving a new one. "You don't understand what this terror means, Marion. You may be fuelled by death, but I am fuelled by fear. Yours may be the more powerful, but ti is also the most erratic. A sudden burst, then a fading away. Mine is ever constant and not only present in those around. I can use my own as you never will, for you are immune to your power." And with that, Tittanya harnessed the terror and ran faster than Marion ever could in her hungry state. Marion didn't try, she just picked up the knife. An instument of fear. An instrument of Death. And Tittanya's. The owner traceable through the object. "For my sister." The chase began.

      Marion launched herself from the rickety stool and followed Tittanya into the night. Tittanya ran ahead, frantic for a way out of thismess. Marion felt like she could float away. Her sisters murderer was within reach. Just a little further. Almost. Not quite. Got her! Marion and Tittanya tumbled to the ground, growling and scratching. Then Tittanya was on top, her dagger plunging towards Marions heart.  Tittanya pulled the knife from the Marions chest. "I never thought you stupid." Tittanya whispered to the lifeless heart.

      " So, you've finally come..." Tittanya pale, thin lips curled into a sinister smile. But it was her green eyes that were the most terrifying- cold and reeking of pure evil. When Marion did not reply, Tittanya beckoned her over to the stool beside her. She held up a drink, "Let us drink to the end of a wonderful... adventure." "The end?" Marion asked, hesitantly raising the glass. "Marion, Marion." Tittanya crowed, "You know as well as I do that this pursuit cannot go on much longer. Only one of us can survive. Let us enjoy our last moments." "Why should I accept your poison?" Tittanya shrugged and sipped from her own glass. "Suit yourself." Marion eyed her nemesis suspiciously. "What are you up to this time?" "I don't understand what you mean," she said quickly, taking another drink. "You're staling, aren't you?" Marion searched Tittanya with one sweeping look from head to toe. Tittanya's glass smashed against the floor. Marion continued, having successfully intimidated Tittanya, "Stop your games, Tittanya. It all stops now! Face me like any honourable person would." To Marion's great surprise, Tittanya fled out of the bar into the dark of night

       That night Marion began to feel hungry. She had been wandering the city, talking to her sister.As she wandered, Marion had felt something was missing. She still didn't know what, and she still had no idea where Tittanya was.Noting a bar across the road, Marion made a bee-line for it.Once in, she stopped dead. There, right in the middle of the room, was Tittanya. Her sister's murderer...

       She looked down with surprise at the blood that soaked into the gauze to meet her own. Then she looked at the young man at her feet, the vacant expression in his eyes and the smile on his lips.   "For my sister!" Her voice had become breathless with passion. "In her death, she became my life. And now she has yours. Why do you smile? Is death so good? I wouldn't know, and you cannot tell me. Will I ever find out?" These questions flowed from her with the ease of practice. Somehow she seemed to feel an affinity with Death. She was her instrument.   Marion stopped, unsure of where this certainty the Death was female came from. Maybe it was because Death was so beautiful.   She was her instrument. A double edged expression. Just as death was the instrument of Marion, Marion was the instrument of Death.   It was a while before Marion realised that she was no longer cold in the chill breeze. She was not cold, but she was alive, so gloriously alive, and free from death. Yet she was fuelled by Death.   "Thank you."   The corpse did not respond.   "My sister is dead, but I am not. And neither is her killer. For my sister."   With the picture of Marions dying/dead sister held firmly in her mind, Marion began the long and epic quest for Tittanya.

       Marion stepped out onto the road. The sunlight stabbed at her eyes, threatening to blind her.    Quickly, she looked down at the wet pavement. Seeing her reflection in the puddle at her feet, Marion thought she looked unusually pale. Then she realised that blood loss did that to you.    Shuffling along, Marion realised she was rather hungry. Thinking about where to get a good meal, she bumped into a young man.    Mumbling her apologies, Marion noticed that the young man smelt very good. Good enough to eat.    Before she could stop herself, Marion reached up and pulled the young man's head down, tasting the salty sweetness flowing in his veins.

       But she had not fainted again. It was simply that Tittanya had left her, abandoned her withput another soul in sight.   Marion played several theories around in her mind. How did she get here? How was it possible that she still lived? And it was at that moment Marion realised what the stranger in her dream had meant. It was irrelevent how all these events came to take place - the important thing was to sort out this whole mess.    Already the icy water half-filled the tub. Marion shivered involuntarily as if glacier daggers sliced through her body. She made a move to turn off the water, but her hands were weak from the wounds/ her head light from blood loss. Unable to even stand and get up, Marion reached for the gauze Tittanya had left on a nearby bench. With much splashing nd difficulty, she too managed to cover the wounds and cease the flow of blood.    Fuelled by the wild fires of revenge, Marion ignored the pain and stepped out of the bath. "For my sister," she repeated over and over lie a mantra spurring her on.     The air wa stale and surprisingly colder than the bath, but Marion took no notice. All that mattered to her was to avenge her sister's death .       To find and stop Tittanya.

       Awakening from the brief dream, Marion felt light, she was lying on her back in a pool of crimson blood.   Tittanya was standing over her, her face like carved marble, expressionless.   "Why won't you die?" tittanya sounded interested, not angry.   Picking Marion up, she carried her over to a bathtub in the next room. Placing Marion in the bathtub as a mother would put her child to bed, Tittanya began to run a bath.   Bending over Marion, Tittanya slashed open her own wrist. After letting herself bleed for a couple of seconds, Tittanya picked up a roll of guaze and wrapped her wrists to stop the bleeding, then moved out of the room.   "Now to destroy the evidence." Those were the last words Marion would ever hear.

        When Marion eventually awoke, light flooded into her head. Suddenly remembering the events prior to her fainting, she selfconciously felt her wrists. No blood, no cut, no wound, nothing. Not even a scratch.   "Marion." A resonant voice came from behind her.   "W-whaa...?" She asked. Confused, she turned.   The man standing behind her looked kindly down on her. Marion felt no breeze, but his hair flickered, beams of sunlight bounced off.   "Marion." He repeated, smiling.   "I-I don't understand. What happened? Where am I? Who are you? Why are you here?" She stammered.   "You always questioned everything. I mean, thats what got you into this mess in the first place. Tittanya tried to kill you, but you're still alive. You challenged death, yet you still breathe. Why ask questions? Why not simply accept things the way they are?"      The dream faded as abruptly as it had come.

       Hmm, watch out. This story has been written by 3 different people.    Marion looked into the cold, green eyes of her murderer. She saw no remorse, no triumph, no pleasure, nothing.   Shuddering, she grasped her wrist to slow the bleeding, only to have the dagger flick out again and open a vien on the exposed wrist.   "Too bad you only wrote of me as the 'Imaginary Fiend' in your diary. Now I'll get away without a mark." Tittanya's smile sent a shiver racing down Marion's spine.   Darkness crept around the edges of her vision, almost welcoming. Sighing, Marion closed her eyes and slept.
