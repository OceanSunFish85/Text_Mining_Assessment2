       In my snailmail, one beautiful summers' day, there was a pin with the statement "I'm a witch" on it. Half year earlier, I had opened a Christmas present from a friend. A black T-shirt witha white inscription saying "Witch." Several years ago, while still under the age of ten, kids in the playground yelled that very word after me. One glance at my red hair, and it's all there. The meanings are the same, but still...they have changed.        The reason people used to call me a witch was: my father is a minister, I have this red hair and I am slightly different. Today it is because I believe in spirituality, I have red hair, and this television character called Willow have some of the same qualities as me. And Willow, she is indeed a witch. But if a witch is a female who practices wicca, then I'm not. But for a long time, that definition might not have been the only one. Any person beliving in something more than what meets the eye, and the enourmous power that lies in powers that are all around us, might be called a witch. Where I grew up, being a Christian girl was just like being a witch. You were hunted, you were teased and you were bruised. You got semi-raped, chased down the roads and barricaded. In a Christian paper, that I read online every now and then, a danish survey claims that young people drop out of church. When becoming teenagers, they're not interested anymore. Even though I was partly active in a Christian group when I was a teenager, I can still relate to that. After quitting that group, I've only been back a few times. And sometimes, I've once again been singled out. As new, fresh blood, over-welcome in the house of God, but still ridiculed in public press and public areas. It's more comfortable to practice religion on a light every-day basis, than exluding it into that one time on Sundays. At one time, you get tired of being hunted. Being asked the same questions by everyone, and your spiritual life being an issue of discussion everywhere. Still hunted, being different. So why do I wear the button, the shirt, and why do I love them? Because the witch that I am is a red haired girl that believe that God and Jesus is in everything, and that every breath I take is a breath with their spirit. And today, oh yes, that is witch-craft. That, and believing in that this Force indeed can heal you, from just about everything. APower that islatent inall that surrounds us, inside and outside.       One night, a few weeks back, I had a dream where the shirt and the pin had changed. They no longer had the word witch in them. Instead the pinsaid "I'm a believer, " and the shirt spelled "Believer." I woke up, quite happy. And aiming to one day have those inscriptions with me.        They say spirituality is on it's way up again. That would be nice. ButI have my doubts. Even though I noticed that people haven't asked me those silly questions for a long time. Maybe they have realized that the answers they refused to understand makes sense somehow. I don't know. I'll still try to hang on to my religion . With my little button and the nice shirt. The Willow-thingies. She has Wicca, and I have Christianity.

       I find myself wanting to fill this blog with nonsense. For instance: I could tell you about my meals, my laundry and what movie I watched on television today. But I'd rather say: I found two vegans in my life. And I found a site that might help me become asomewhat more animal-friendly person than I already am. That's useful news, don't you think? Want to pitch in, save the earth and such things, yourself? I guess there's a lot one can do. And I'm halfhearted glad I found that site, with shoes, jackets etc that are not made by anything ever been close to an animal! But why, oh WHY (!!) does these kind of designs always look so boring?! Well. They had some interesting sneakers and winterboots, but it wasn't exactly campers ...
