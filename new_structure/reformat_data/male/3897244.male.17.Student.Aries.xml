      chatted with mah ex just now.. not joey.. my 1st gf.. hes tha currect gf of my friend kenny.. holy cow.. i really wonder how kenny can stand her.. she msg me 1st 1st.. and we started chattin.. 1st we were talkin bout her stuff with kenny.. i told her to appreciate kenny.. and blah blah.. and she always take kenny's feelin for granted.. seriously if i were kenny i would threw her into the mlk river and feel the staving crocs.. hahaha then she started chattin bout me.. and thats why made me angry.. as far i as i can remember, our chattin session always ending up like this.. i got angry and the session ends.. she talks without thinkin much.. its like whatever she thinks she'll say.. if its true, i dont mind.. but most of it are her assumptions.. holy cow.. she said my ex [joey] still loves me .. blah blah.. blek blek.. then i shouldnt have break.. lala lele.. then outta sudden she points the gun towards me and start shootin.. saying im bad la to treat joey like that.. say cuz of me shes very sad la.. say cuz of me she lost trust on guys la.. then ask me go think what ive done to her.. and go think does she deserve that.. and say im cruel la and say i this kinda ppl duno how to appreciate.. blaH! how much does she knows bout me and jo? shes not even a close friend of joey.. needless to say bout me.. yeah when i broke with jo i hurt her alot.. and frankly.. i was very guilty bout it.. we been through everything for more than a year.. those memories is enough to kill.. thinkin bout those timewe spent together.. really makes me dont wanna leave joey.. and yeaH i still loveher then.. i lied i lost my feelin already.. just to make her give up on me.. i was selfish then.. but i was having a hard time also.. seriously i cant concentrate in my studies.. and when reachin the end of the relationship that time.. we always quarrel.. everytime we quarrel.. it hurts inside.. and at nite i'll keep thinkin bout it.. and its like.. even in class i keep thinkin bout it.. its like a kinda worry.. or whatever feelin its called.. u always think bout it.. and it isnt a happy thing to think about.. yet u cant help it as it always haunt ur mind.. this kinda feelin goes on for 3 months.. if im not wrong.. though i pretended nothing happened.. and yeah.. in between the last 3 months we had some happy time too.. but the few days of mental torment is enough to kill me.. im that kinda of guy who always wanna be carefree.. this kinda thing makes me feel like.. urgh.. givin up everything and dont wanna bother anymore.. and yeah i did.. for my own good.. ignoring joey feelin.. i was guilty for the 1st few months.. and then things got better... i got over it.. and to tell ya the truth.. single life is carefree.. i'm happy with it ... though it can be lonely sometimes but its a small price to pay lak.. like as i said .. if i ever wanna start i new 1 .. the girl will be the 1 i very love.. and i'll sacrifice to make it last... but.. ahh.. not easy to find that kinda girl... sometimes we see pretty girls, we admire... but to love.. u need to know that girl.. to know so well that u can predict her next word she gonna utter.. and yet accepting everything that she is.. from the looks to the heart =) hahaha blah.. im talking too emo-ly.. blah its my journal anyway.. i write whatever i want here.. today i read a book in my friend's house.. its like.. bout coping with life's obstacles... it says when we face a problem in life, if we dont solve it, bigger problem of it will surface.. until the moment u solve it and learn a lesson from it..how true uh.. hahaha    -peKie-  [ =)= ]

      "She Will Be Loved" Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure  It doesn't matter anymore It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved..  [beautiful song.. enjoy it]
