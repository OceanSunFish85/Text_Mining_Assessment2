      I have a new piece... I just finished it a minute ago... I hope all the people that this piece is about know that they are included in my thoughts...   My Friends...  My place is darkâ¦ and my sky is grayâ¦ But I caught the glimpse of a star todayâ¦ The void grows smallerâ¦ with each moment goneâ¦ As twilight endsâ¦ just before morningâs dawnâ¦ This moment is rare for people like meâ¦ Who travel lonely paths to their destinyâ¦ Deep down in my soulâ¦ I am not so sad For companions surround meâ¦ and for this I am gladâ¦ Their paths are all differentâ¦ no two are the sameâ¦ Except for the fact that they all shout my nameâ¦ It is them who have given me all of my hopeâ¦ They have taught me to loveâ¦ and help me to copeâ¦ With the tears in my heartâ¦ and the scars in my mindâ¦ And one thing is certainâ¦ they wonât leave me behindâ¦ It is they that I thank for my happiness tooâ¦ For without themâ¦ I donât know what Iâd doâ¦ It is you who have shaped what I have becomeâ¦ I have you all to thank for escaping the glumâ¦ Not all of them are with me todayâ¦ Some had left me behind when I drifted awayâ¦ But the few that I have are my most cherished friendsâ¦ Whoâll remain in my heart until my endâ¦ Theyâve given all this hope to meâ¦ Iâd die for themâ¦ So they may seeâ¦ Another day to glance at the skyâ¦ And the ghost of their dreamer flying highâ¦ You who stood by me for 8 crazy yearsâ¦ You with your blue coat... always in good cheer... You with your heart in the stars up aboveâ¦ You with your kindness made me fall in loveâ¦  You who I teach the Dreamerâs Songâ¦ You who I laugh with all day longâ¦ All of you gave me the wings to flyâ¦ Youâll remain in my heart til the day that I dieâ¦ I hope that you all will remember these daysâ¦ That I shared with youâ¦ and showed you my waysâ¦

      Another story to pass on as I continue my journey... Hope you enjoy...   Dreams Will Never Die  The world can turn itâs back to youâ¦  But Dreams will never dieâ¦ The darkness and corruption can consume your soulâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ Your hopes can wither and rotâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ Your life as you know it can drift into nothingâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ A starry sky can be shattered into oblivionâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ You mayâ¦ never beâ¦ with the one you loveâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ You can lose your faith in what you believeâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ You may choose to let go of your dreamsâ¦ and give upâ¦ But Dreams will never dieâ¦ You cannot forsake the dreams that you makeâ¦ For Dreams will never dieâ¦ Even if you wish they didâ¦ Those Dreams will never dieâ¦ They will follow you until the endâ¦ That takes a lot to understandâ¦ They will follow you till the day you dieâ¦ There is no use to question whyâ¦ Donât ever give upâ¦ donât even tryâ¦ For those Dreams will never dieâ¦ You can try to forget themâ¦ deny that you knowâ¦ But deep in your mindâ¦ they forever will growâ¦ And they wonât stay in your mindâ¦ they will drift to your heartâ¦ Where they will open the doorâ¦ or they will tear it apartâ¦ Your Dreams are essentialâ¦ in your soul they will bloomâ¦  But if they never come trueâ¦ your mind theyâll consumeâ¦ They will bring tears to your eyesâ¦As your heart slowly diesâ¦ With no one around to hear your pathetic criesâ¦  This is my maledictionâ¦ my terrible curseâ¦ My Dreams pass me byâ¦ and the going gets worseâ¦ But the world melts away when I look to the skyâ¦ With the song in my heart that singsâ¦ âI will fly!â And one day I will have itâ¦ one day Iâll find loveâ¦ And again I will seeâ¦ my stars up aboveâ¦ This is my devotionâ¦ This is my idealâ¦ It may not be instâ¦ and it may not be realâ¦ But Iâll follow these until my lonely demiseâ¦ This is the faith that has opened my eyesâ¦ A world without boundariesâ¦ a world without walls A world without limitsâ¦ if you answer the calls...  This is the place that I will belongâ¦  On Chronia they sing the Dreamerâs Songâ¦ And though it is only fiction to youâ¦ In my heartâ¦ I know it to be trueâ¦ That one day it will come to meâ¦ Fateâs evil swordâ¦ KwaL naâz Theli And with my blood it will shine anewâ¦ The Crimson Blade of Dreamsâ¦ Shi-Tekuâ¦ So here I standâ¦ alone and apartâ¦ Waiting for what lies in my heartâ¦ A door to yet another worldâ¦. With new thoughts and hopes and dreams unfurledâ¦ And so the saying goes alongâ¦ As I sing my Dreamerâs Songâ¦ âNo matter how shatteredâ¦ or broken they areâ¦ Your dreams in the darknessâ¦ are a shining starâ¦ And no matter how hopelessâ¦ your Dreamâs youâll achieveâ¦ If you hold true to your faithâ¦ and in your heart you believe... Youâll drift across oceansâ¦ Youâll touch the skyâ¦ Youâll pass through the agesâ¦ Never caring whyâ¦ For your Dreams will never dieâ¦"  As long as you believeâ¦ And I Doâ¦

      This is the beginning I guess... this is the gateway from my world to yours... or at least part of it... I welcome all of you... I might as well begin with the reason why I made this... I need a place to store my writings so that people can see them... since Poetry.com is money grubbing, and has limited space I've decided to come here... Well here are the first 3 pieces to join this maiden voyage...   The Thoughts of A Dreamer  As a dreamer stands tall...  Alone and shattered he wanders... Always drifting in the wind... Always falling towards his fate... Struggling to find his destiny Fighting the loneliness in his heart... What future is there to comeâ¦? For one who has seen the painâ¦. Whoâs lost in the eyes of society... And trapped in the void Forever lost in his soul. I must always wonder... Starring up at the stars every night Is there truly a place for me? Will I find my fantasy? Is there truly destiny? Is there truly love for me? Will I ever be free? For many long years I've dreamed of these things... Searching for the truth Yet always finding deceit... Trying to step forward But pushed back so far Where is the place in time...? Where darkness ends... And light begins... The day I find identity... And one day find true destiny... That day shall come to me some time... But for now I must always wonder... When... Where... How... Who...? Such things have always journeyed my mind Yet I feel so broken... Battered down by my past Through the ages I drift... Waiting for the answers I may never find... Hoping for the dreams that may never come... Yet I still stand strong... Never losing faith...   Another Day...  Another day to dream a dream...  Another day the stars don't gleam... Another broken soul to mend... Except my own... it shall not end... And so I look up to the sky... With hopes that one day I will fly... And that one day your world will see... This thing that I call destiny... But it is here I still remain... With fragile dreams that I obtain... Someday you just might understandâ¦ The task I put into my handsâ¦ Of Chronia you hear me speakâ¦ It is this world to which I seekâ¦ I pray this world shall remain safeâ¦ For in Chronia I place my faithâ¦ To escape the pain of societyâs blightâ¦ It is in this dream I find my lightâ¦ And though I cannot see my starâ¦ Inside my dreamâs itâs never farâ¦ I hope that I return to herâ¦ And prove that Iâm not just a Dreamerâ¦ But here I stand, alone and coldâ¦ With dreams not shared, and thoughts untoldâ¦ But I swear! All is not in vainâ¦ Although my life is endless rainâ¦ I have a few who stand by meâ¦ Who opened their hearts and set me freeâ¦ These are the few who gave me wingsâ¦ And show me the happiness your world bringsâ¦ Even they do not understandâ¦ It is I alone who comprehend My Dreams, my Fate, my Destinyâ¦ And all the things inside of meâ¦ So I remain the only oneâ¦ To know the truth to what Iâve begunâ¦ Human, or Chronianâ¦ no difference to meâ¦ For I believe in both you seeâ¦ I am on Earth each passing dayâ¦  But on Wings of Time I fly awayâ¦ As Casartello of the Human raceâ¦ And Dynedockia of ChuâBwa Kuâ Spaceâ¦ Two entities exist insideâ¦ They are my passion, they are my prideâ¦ My heart will heal, my mind has grownâ¦ As I slowly drift into the unknownâ¦ It does not matter wherever I goâ¦ For in my soul I shall always knowâ¦ Thereâs always tomorrowâ¦ thatâs when it may comeâ¦ And the race against Fate has finally begunâ¦   This is Our World  War is among usâ¦ and slowly losing causeâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ We sit back and watch as our children are sent off to dieâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ Our society reeks of Corruptionâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ The mainstream floats to the top,  as the idealists, the visionaries, the dreamers,  and the different people of this world  slowly drown in their wakeâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ Our minds are filled with greed,  And we constantly search for glory, for power, for moreâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ We discriminate towards so many,  âThey are inferior to us, and donât deserve the same rights we haveâ This is our Worldâ¦ Where people stand up and fight the system,  But are battered down by the sheer mass of the oppositionâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ We cannot change societyâ¦ for it is far to big for it to change in wholeâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ Through Fireâ¦ Justice is Servedâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ Even when the odds turn us away, one will still step forward and face societyâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ One will let go of his feelings as an outcast,  and open his eyes to the ways of the Dreamerâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ It is I that shall be the oneâ¦ With clear mind, open heart, and dreams that shall change this worldâ¦ This is our Worldâ¦ A mainstream has learned to free their minds  and slowly accept the thoughts and ideas of a Radical Dreamerâ¦ This is your Worldâ¦ You have all slowly grownâ¦ in your own waysâ¦ and in your own aspirationsâ¦. This is your Worldâ¦ As we slowly travel into tomorrowâ¦  You will all move into the future with strong foundations, And Minds ready for whatever it may bringâ¦ This is your Worldâ¦ And as we head towards that day, we stand strong,  Ready to fight whatever the world puts in our wayâ¦ That is our Worldâ¦ While you spent your days growing upâ¦ One was left behindâ¦ That was my Worldâ¦ A poor soul who never really got the chance to fit inâ¦ That was my Worldâ¦ A boy whoâs good nature was forgotten, or worseâ¦ never knownâ¦ That was my Worldâ¦ Until nowâ¦ Beyond the pain I have feltâ¦ lies a place beyond all sorrowâ¦ That is my Worldâ¦ A place that has shaped my destinyâ¦  and forged the dreams that lie deep inside my soulâ¦ That is my Worldâ¦ In the Galaxy of ChuâBwa Kuââ¦ on the distant world called Chroniaâ¦ That is my Worldâ¦ Of Hawk Dynedockiaâ¦ the Master of timeâ¦  And Fateâ¦ which cast him awayâ¦ with the wordsâ¦  âYou are nothing but a dreamerâ¦ Fool.â That is my Worldâ¦ And So I waitâ¦ and I dreamâ¦ and I believe in tomorrowâ¦ This is my Worldâ¦ With Companions who I hope shall help through the journey that is our livesâ¦  That is my Worldâ¦ We march towards the futureâ¦ with eyes looking to destinyâ¦ Let it be a fulfilling one for all of usâ¦ That is our World!  There we are...  Enjoy... and please feel free to add a comment, I enjoy the feedback!  Through Fire, Justice is Served!  No matter how shattered... or how broken... or how impossible they may be... Dreams never die... as long as you beleive.... and I do... - Hawk Dynedockia

      I have finished a new piece.... hehe... enjoy:   A New Age: Not Yet...   A new age has comeâ¦ and the world around me has changed once againâ¦ my life is taking an unexpected turnâ¦ Towards the society I once feared, I marchâ¦ yet I am welcomed with open armsâ¦ an idea never thought possible in my mindâ¦ New friendships are bornâ¦ and dying love is once again full of lifeâ¦ I have reached the first of my dreamsâ¦ Lifeâ¦ I stand before people who once despised meâ¦ and hold hands with those who once feared meâ¦ Laughter echoes in the nightâ¦ and I continue to dream into the morningsâ¦ every night, dreaming of Finding my faithâ¦ binding with destinyâ¦ and my love for Kidâ¦ as I always haveâ¦ but not something comes to my mindâ¦ something newâ¦ something unexpectedâ¦ somethingâ¦ wrongâ¦ I dream of the endâ¦ of the final moments of the war I will face when I return to Chroniaâ¦ I see the final battleâ¦ I seeâ¦ the final blowâ¦ as thrust Shi Teâku forward into the belly of Fateâ¦ and as his corrupted form falls to the groundâ¦ as the battle around us endsâ¦ and the forces of Chronia stand tall in triumphant victoryâ¦ it is the endâ¦but I cannot see thatâ¦ not nowâ¦ not yetâ¦ How can I Dream of the end of my Pathâ¦ when I have not even begun my journeyâ¦? I shake my headâ¦ yet it still drifts thereâ¦ haunting meâ¦ I cannot look to the endâ¦ when I have not yet even begunâ¦ as I continue to wait for the day that my paths begin to combineâ¦ As I waitâ¦ I am faced with my curiosityâ¦ No one has told me of the Fate I dreamâ¦ of the Path I have given myselfâ¦ there are no signsâ¦ no visionsâ¦ just a dream in my soulâ¦ What do I wait for? What is the cause of my journeyâ¦.? What will the sign beâ¦ That tells me that Destiny has begunâ¦ and that I should begin my quest to find KwaL naâz Theliâ¦ Where do I goâ¦? Elâ BahâNok does not exist in this worldâ¦ and I cannot hear the cries of the forgotten soulâ¦ but still I will go and search when the time is rightâ¦ I will go to the ends of the earth and find itâ¦ but another obstacle now lies in front of meâ¦ My friendsâ¦ my companionsâ¦ the people I loveâ¦ What do they say to my journeyâ¦ to my destiny? What will they choose to believeâ¦ And the hardest thing to think aboutâ¦ will they come with me? For so many yearsâ¦ beyond the blindness of my painâ¦ and my lonelinessâ¦ this trial would be faced by me aloneâ¦ but they were not here with me thenâ¦ does the journey change now? Maybe this was not meant to be only my pathâ¦ maybe it is the ever growing arms of destiny that have led these people to my sideâ¦ Maybe it is for them to face tooâ¦ in their own waysâ¦ It is too late for them to turn awayâ¦ for their souls have intertwined with mineâ¦ at least I hope they haveâ¦ My faith is in their hands nowâ¦ what they choose to do, and to believeâ¦ will affect the storyâ¦ especially oneâ¦ Kidâ¦ Much of this rests on herâ¦on her choicesâ¦ on her beliefsâ¦ on her faithâ¦ So the fate of a Chronian rests in the hands of Humansâ¦ Being one of themâ¦ I find it ironicâ¦ that those controlled by time are linked to the one who controls timeâ¦ So I must sit back and waitâ¦ and follow the currents of lifeâ¦ until the time is readyâ¦ and the true journey beginsâ¦ I will not give upâ¦ no matter what happensâ¦ but I know thisâ¦ If They are with meâ¦. If She is with meâ¦. If You are with meâ¦ I cannot failâ¦

                                          Choose to take the journey of self-discoveryâ¦  In a parallel world, but in similar times, the world of Mâiel (me el) has a more laid back way of life (More forests, less cities, and relative peace.) Classic tales of groups of young kids who set out to journey and change the world are still told to the young. Enter our main character Toboe (toe bow A), who has always been enthralled by these stories. He decides to make a similar pilgrimage, but on his own accord. Of course it was easy for him to do it because he was orphaned since his parents died when he was seven. His brother Taita (tie sha) however, has lived with his aunt and uncle since that faithful day, when he was taken out of his mother when she was dying. (Toboe never lived with his aunt and uncle because they despise him, even though he doesnât know why) Toboe is all about making choices, whenever someone would ask for advice from him; he believes that you should never be bound to the words of a man who doesnât know your true aura inside. He made the decision to go on his own so that his journey was his own passage (he hasnât trust many people since that summer day.) His plans changed forever when he went to say goodbye to his brother, and he saw what awful things his relatives were doing to him. Toboe rescued him and let him choose whether or not he wanted to escape his life and go with him. After long thought, Taita decides to travel with Toboe and see the world for what it is.  Now as for me, Iâm Vigo, (Veego) the narrator of the story (Donât think that I donât play an active role in this story though, I know your dying to see me in action.) Enjoy the story for what it is and enjoy Toboeâs many adventures of the wondrous world of Mâiel filled with magic, charm, and romance. Also remember what Vigo says, âNo matter where your travels take you, youâll always end up on top.â                               Perfect Symphonies                                Chapter 1   "Wake up Toboe!" A voice from far off called. It had to be his annoying friend lance, who always brought him away from his daydreaming. "What do you want Lance?" Toboe said in a dejected way. "Well, what I want is for you to get up off the ground and come to the forest with me so we can get our job done before the head mistress gets restless." Toboe slowly rose from his once vegetate state, and then gently stroked his hair. He sighed knowing that today was going be another boring day in his meaningless life. Lance and Toboe made there way into the forest to cut some firewood for the fireplace so that all the kids in the orphanage could enjoy some extra heat as spring quickly was dawning on the peaceful town of Almott. You see, Toboe and Lance are the oldest people in the orphanage, (with the exception of the head-mistress) so they took it upon themselves to be the big brothers of all the children.  Toboe and Lance chopped some wood and decided to go to the waterfall before taking the wood back. "I don't understand you sometimes." Lance said jokingly. "I'm not sure I follow you." Toboe said. "Well for starters, it's the middle of winter and you decide to go to the waterfalls. Also, it's dead of night and all you're wearing is a long-sleeved shirt." "Nowadays, I don't feel things much. Inside me mentally and physically, so there's no need for me to use much needed clothes from the kids. Besides, I'm not going to go swimming; I'm going here to think about things. "What could you possibly have to think about? There's not much to do in our life besides helping others, and running around annoying people."(How true)  Lance was confused beyond all belief. He thought that Toboe has been acting rather strangely lately. He's been a lot quieter, not as social, and he seemed to be depressed or that he had something important on his mind. Now you have to be a little dense to not see what's wrong with Lance. (I will explain) Lance is a very plain person; he believes that all he sees is what is real. Sometimes, his "tunnel vision" constricts him from seeing the real problem within like in Toboe's situation right now. "That's exactly it Lance! We don't have anything; our possessions are also the possessions of the orphanage." Toboe started getting exited in his reasoning "So that supposed to make us happy?" Lance still didn't get it. (idiot) "Well no, actually yes, it means that we aren't being manipulated by greed for more like most other people. There is only one thing that we possess, that no one else can possess." "And that would be..." (His ignorance amazes me.) "The freedom of our imagination, the freedom of life, the freedom of life. No matter what, no one can deprive us of that." "That's some deep stuff Toboe." Lance finally got his thought. "I don't know though, sometimes it's not enough. I just wish that there were something more to life than this." Toboe suddenly lost all of his excitement and started to fall into a depression. "Come on now Toboe." Lance went over and grabbed Toboe's arm. He dragged him to the special spot under the water-fall. It was the special place that all the orphans would go to in the summer. They sat on a rock and thought hard about their life. "You're lucky Lance." 'No you are the lucky one Toboe. You had your parents until you were seven. I never knew mine at all. They must have really hated me to just up and leave me like that." He began to cry. 6/21 to be continued

      haha... I'll laugh if someone reads this before I change it... but what the hell... I've got a new poem on the way... Ill keep the name disclosed for the time being... I dont want to spoil my own fun... *cocks the gun* lol... well anyway... This is probably my favorite piece so far... I hope you all like it when it's ready!  *UPDATE* Ok it's ready!   Kid...   The clock ticks forward day by dayâ¦ And my mind is still so far awayâ¦ In the world at which I want to beâ¦ To continue to forge my destinyâ¦ But something crossed my path in a wayâ¦  That brought sunlight to a cloudy dayâ¦ In my aching heart deep down insideâ¦ In the old void where my dreams collideâ¦ There were no more clouds and no more rainâ¦ No more sadness and no more painâ¦ So now I am free of that terrible placeâ¦ And who do I thank? Whoâs the one I embrace? The girl who showed me the stars tonightâ¦ And helped me escape my lonely blightâ¦ Who is the girl that Iâm talking about? Take a wild guessâ¦ youâll figure it outâ¦ Called an Angel by them for the things that she didâ¦ But to me, she is rascally known as âKidââ¦ Kid Iâve admired for so many yearsâ¦ As I recovered my soul, and overcame fearsâ¦ She has changed my world, the girl that I loveâ¦ My only true link to the stars up aboveâ¦ The world is a desolate place without herâ¦ But she is the answer, she is the cureâ¦ To the worst of pains; a broken heartâ¦ Cracked open wideâ¦ and torn apartâ¦ With her laugh and her smile the pain is goneâ¦ And with that the darkness withers to dawnâ¦ I dream of a day when youâre by my sideâ¦ Hand in hand on our wings we will strideâ¦ It is only a dreamâ¦ as much as that sucksâ¦ The idea causes my emotions to fluxâ¦ But again Kid is there, and she has the brassâ¦ To give what I neededâ¦ a good kick in the assâ¦ She woke me up from that evil nightmareâ¦ And awoke me into a place whereâ¦ That dream doesnât matter if comes or notâ¦ Because our friendship exists and that matters a lotâ¦ I drift through the ages dreaming of youâ¦ With soul so pureâ¦ and heart so trueâ¦ And of the day that finally sheâ¦ Will find her wings and fly with meâ¦ From a lonely world that writhes in painâ¦ Away from the cloudsâ¦ away from the rainâ¦ To an Azure skyâ¦ and a Golden sunâ¦ This dream to me has more than begunâ¦ It is real to meâ¦ as the life that I liveâ¦ The air that I breatheâ¦ and the feelings I giveâ¦ So what do I see as I turn to the skyâ¦? I see usâ¦ up thereâ¦ flying highâ¦ With the wind in our facesâ¦ and the stars up aboveâ¦ The clouds at our feetâ¦ and our hearts filled with loveâ¦ Weâd race across oceansâ¦ Weâd drift in the breezeâ¦ Weâd soar up the mountainsâ¦ with our souls at easeâ¦ Nothing else matters when Iâm at her sideâ¦ Just the song in my heartâ¦ and my eyes opened wideâ¦. To the dreams in my soul that one day we may shareâ¦ In this whole new world that Iâve started to dareâ¦ To dream of a futureâ¦ where Fate is deadâ¦ What a beautiful thing Iâve got in my headâ¦ Youâve taught me so much in the last 4 yearsâ¦ But thereâs one thing you taught me that brings me to tearsâ¦ No matter what happensâ¦ I believe in youâ¦ Because the way that I see itâ¦ Dreams really come trueâ¦

I stand atop the highest plateauâ¦ waiting for the clouds to openâ¦ I think I can see themâ¦ the starsâ¦Iâ¦ I have spent my lifetime waiting for this dayâ¦ And now its finally hereâ¦ the void inside me is going to closeâ¦ close foreverâ¦ My thoughtsâ¦ my dreams have brought me to this dayâ¦ and now it is time to say goodbye to an emptyâ¦ lonely worldâ¦ As I look upâ¦ I can see itâ¦ the break in the cloudsâ¦ a crack to the outside worldâ¦ a doorway to freedomâ¦ The time is rightâ¦ and I sprout my wingsâ¦ and take offâ¦  The clouds still roar with thunderâ¦and lightning still dances across the skyâ¦ The time will soon come when I enter the cloudsâ¦ and the maelstrom aboveâ¦ It is then that I must concentrateâ¦  The black ground below slowly disappearsâ¦ and the grey mist of the clouds surrounds meâ¦ as I continue to fly upwardâ¦ I can feel the winds getting strongerâ¦ but I must press onwardâ¦ The darkest part of my world is hereâ¦ it is the coreâ¦ the center of my confusionâ¦ my chaosâ¦ it is what keeps me from escapingâ¦ until nowâ¦ I can see the openingâ¦ and as I race for itâ¦ I am chasing by lightningâ¦ a demon refusing to let go of its vesselâ¦ Closer and closer I get to reaching my goalâ¦ the strength of endless dreams and desires fuels my raging furyâ¦ it is so close to meâ¦ suddenly for the first time in a lifetimeâ¦ I see the light of the sunâ¦ I am almost thereâ¦ I am almost freeâ¦ but the gap slowly begins to closeâ¦ I must reach it in timeâ¦ before I am too lateâ¦ Energy surges through meâ¦ and my wings press through the gale windsâ¦ I am going to make it! I feel warmth insideâ¦ The light passes onto my skinâ¦ And I can feel the warmth of its lightâ¦ as I pass through the barrierâ¦ and before I can look up... Time stopsâ¦ My hand reaching outâ¦ to youâ¦ you the one who has made it possibleâ¦ I can see you thereâ¦ it is too bright to see your faceâ¦ but I can see your eyesâ¦ staring back at meâ¦ I am free I know I amâ¦ I see your hand motion towards meâ¦but then my eyes shutâ¦ I cringe in painâ¦ confusedâ¦ I remain there frozenâ¦ unable to moveâ¦ only my eyesâ¦ and as I look down to the horrorâ¦ A spear impales my chestâ¦ a spear with the emblem ofâ¦ an angelâ¦ it isâ¦ yoursâ¦ unable to breatheâ¦ I can see myself beginning to fallâ¦ my body falls backwardâ¦ towards the barrier that is the voidâ¦ the last of you I seeâ¦ is your faceâ¦ no longer shrouded in darknessâ¦ smilingâ¦ laughingâ¦ as you walk awayâ¦ this world disappears.. and the only things I can feel inside are the surge of pain from my heartâ¦ and the tears falling from my eyes...  I see the sunâ¦ the oh so beautiful sunâ¦ rising into the skyâ¦ just as the opening to what would set me freeâ¦ closes in front of meâ¦ I continue to fallâ¦ I leave behind a trail of dead feathersâ¦ and tearsâ¦ my wings slowly begin to wither and dieâ¦ and the winds of the maelstromâ¦ throw me across the plainsâ¦ soon the clouds stretch across my viewâ¦ as I break through their graspâ¦ feathers chaotically drifting in the windsâ¦ my hand still reaching outâ¦ as I hit the groundâ¦ with a skull shattering blowâ¦ The plains roar with thunderâ¦ and it begins to rainâ¦ my body is brokenâ¦ my soul is shatteredâ¦ my wings are lifeless bones on the ground under meâ¦ but I feel nothingâ¦ not the cracks in my skullâ¦ not the raindrops falling on my faceâ¦ mixing with the tears of blood falling from my eyesâ¦ just the pain of a spear impaled through my dying heartâ¦ and Fateâ¦ watching me from aboveâ¦ laughingâ¦ but I am not to die this dayâ¦ my malediction is much worseâ¦ I am doomed to exist for eternityâ¦ with broken bone and shattered willâ¦ glaring up at the skyâ¦ as it rains down upon me...  my hand still stretch outâ¦ out to youâ¦   and Part II - The Beginning...  Itâs time to open my eyes. Thereâs more to this... thereâs got to be... Thereâs more emotion elsewhere... and Iâve seen it... and Iâve brought it back with me... There is so much pain... but I canât let go... not of the world I createdâ¦ even if I never see it... itâs still mine to command! And with that I make another choice.. with a little yelling of course.. Itâs time to let go of this spear... and forget the past... its time to start living in the future... the way I did back then... and so I place my hands on this spear that I have driven into my soul... and I grasp it firm... and with all my strength... well lets just say it FUCKING hurt! Anyway... with that... I could feel my body changing... and the void around me... the rain stops... and the cracks in the rocks begin to slowly repair themselves... so this is truly my heart... As I feel my body once again I slowly make my way to my feet... and with a snap of my hands... the pain is gone... there is no more hole in my bodyâ¦ and the cracks in my skull are gone... Everything makes sense againâ¦ and now I realize... I must go. If Fate wonât give me a way out... and with a mere thought, the feathers on my wings again flutter in the wind... Iâll just have to make my own! And with that I give myself a running start... with the speed of Hawk Dynedockia I burst into the horizon... Itâs time... I know now that the time is right to leave this place... my wings spread and my eyes focused on the sky above, I speed up the largest plateau... the same one I began my journey on... and with my last look of the plain below me, I took off into the maelstrom.  The winds do not falter my speedâ¦ as I race through the clouds above... I can see the end... the barrier... Fateâs hands are stretched out before me...  With the thought, the spear that had pierced my body comes to my hand. The sorrow and pain this whole void, in essence lies in that spear... and with all my strength,  of the powers of every moment in time... past... present... future... combine into one, I thrust it forward into the clouds in front of meâ¦ and the hands of Fate Shattered today... I fly through the barrier out of this void... victorious... As I take the first breath in a brand new world, the spear still flying forward in front of my transforms... out of the shadows, and out of the sorrow... comes the greatest blade ever forged... the reborn blade of KwaL Na'z Theli... Sword of Dreams... Shi-Teku... and as I grasp my forgotten blade... I feel my soul deep down inside... I am Chronian once again... I have won my first battle... in the war against Fate... but I do not stop in the world aboveâ¦ I press onwardâ¦ into the sunny skyâ¦ into the starsâ¦ Into spaceâ¦ I dream once more!  Towards Chronia! Towards Destiny! And I have youâ¦ the one who threw that spearâ¦ noâ¦ you who have given me the start I needed so many timesâ¦ when my mind is caught in the snare of pestilenceâ¦ you are there to let it looseâ¦ time and time again... thanks kid...

      New work... and if your worried, Im not depressed or anything, though my writing would say otherwise right now...   My World...   There is place far away from hereâ¦ a place beyond any horizonâ¦ beyond your sight... beyond your comprehensionâ¦ It is a dark placeâ¦ an endless plain of black rockâ¦ cracked and jaggedâ¦ and above, only cloudsâ¦ dark grey clouds with lightning coursing through them.  It is always rainingâ¦ There is nothingâ¦ nothing at the end of this horizonâ¦ nothingâ¦ but oneâ¦ a dark figureâ¦ soaked in waterâ¦ in tearsâ¦ in bloodâ¦ Frozen to his soulâ¦ as he stands against the rain pouring down on himâ¦ This darknessâ¦ this painâ¦ thisâ¦ is the voidâ¦ thisâ¦ is my worldâ¦ and that figureâ¦ with tears in his eyesâ¦ and a fist full of bloodâ¦ is none other than the Crimson Dreamer himselfâ¦ I am that manâ¦ that shellâ¦ with nothing inside me but this world that I see around meâ¦ Many times have I tried to escape this placeâ¦  but as I break the boundaries of it, Fate intervenesâ¦ and I tumble back down to this dark earthâ¦ There is nothing hereâ¦ and no oneâ¦ so I much walk these plains for eternityâ¦ with nothing to set me free from this burdenâ¦ but waitâ¦ in a flash of light this world is goneâ¦ and I am in another placeâ¦ your worldâ¦ where I am with all of youâ¦ my friendsâ¦ and we talkâ¦ and we laughâ¦ and we existâ¦ togetherâ¦ l stand here tooâ¦ facing the sunsetâ¦ with wings drifting in the breezeâ¦ hand in handâ¦ with the one I loveâ¦ but then another flash of lightâ¦ and I am in a world I have never seenâ¦ standing before Fateâ¦ My Crimson Blade in hand, ready to fight the battle that is my destinyâ¦ but my eyes openâ¦ and I am once again in the never ending rainâ¦ they are all just echoesâ¦  in my mindâ¦ These are dreamsâ¦ dreams that are never going to comeâ¦ love that will never blossomâ¦ destiny that will never come to passâ¦ This is the world that I must live in every dayâ¦ with the tears of loneliness in my heartâ¦ and the blood that bleeds from my soul as I am battered down by societyâ¦ It is so cold hereâ¦ and there is nothing to keep me safeâ¦ to keep me warmâ¦ to keep me happyâ¦ I have lost it all to Fateâ¦ but it does not stop me from dreaming for another dayâ¦ To stand up tall in the pouring rainâ¦ coldâ¦ sadâ¦ and lonelyâ¦ and Dream of a place where this world does not existâ¦ Where I hold my beloved in my armsâ¦ and where I truly fly on my wings of timeâ¦ but then I wake up from the dreamâ¦ and the day begins againâ¦ There is nothing left and nowhere to goâ¦ there is no more song in my heartâ¦ there is no more skip in my stepâ¦ just the aimless path that I walk in this placeâ¦. Hoping to find somethingâ¦ or someoneâ¦ so each day passes me by... another lonely day is over withâ¦ and a new one is here in its placeâ¦ Think not of this placeâ¦ but that shouldnât be too hard for the oblivious children of earthâ¦

      Well... a little break from the ANA (A new age)  This is something I started writing a few months ago... and finally finished All I need is a name for the piece...  Here's to you Matt... It's been an honor to learn from the best... ^_^   My Mentor  (Named by anddedicated toMatt Sprotte)  My lifeâs journey continues itâs raceâ¦  But Now Arises a familiar faceâ¦  A man from days of forgotten gloryâ¦  Back when I began my storyâ¦  Back to an age when my dreams were just dreams...  When my heart was a hole... a void so it seems...  Before I saw the power I had...  Or the poet inside me... My writing was bad...  I was merely a Kid... lost in my tearsâ¦  With pain in my soulâ¦ haunted by fearsâ¦  But before I found loveâ¦ I had an escapeâ¦  That was shown to me by a man with a capeâ¦  He saw my potentialâ¦ but I needed workâ¦  And he stayed by my side when the others were jerksâ¦  He taught me the ways of the people up highâ¦  Who created new worlds in the blink of an eyeâ¦  An Adventurerâs fate could lie in his handsâ¦  Heâd decide their futureâ¦ and give them commandsâ¦  To succeed or to fail in this game we playâ¦  Itâs life in this worldâ¦ or so we would sayâ¦  But this game that we playâs not as hard as it seemsâ¦  As I focused the power that channeled my dreamsâ¦  I saw this world for what it really wasâ¦  Now I stand by his sideâ¦ and itâs only becauseâ¦  Of a man with the name that I call my ownâ¦  With the lessonâs heâd taught and the ideas heâd sewnâ¦  Into my mindâ¦ and then they would sproutâ¦  And Iâd know what this creativityâs aboutâ¦  I opened my eyesâ¦ and I set free my soulâ¦  With the help of my mentorâ¦ I got out of that wholeâ¦  You set me down the path I takeâ¦  You gave me a chance to atone my mistakesâ¦  You gave me the skills to continue alongâ¦  The Notes to sing the dreamers songâ¦  So hereâs to you my venerable friendâ¦  Funnyâ¦ and loyal to the endâ¦  Youâll always be a mentor to meâ¦  For you helped shape my destinyâ¦  No one out there rpâs like you canâ¦  King of the GMâsâ¦ my masterâ¦ Matt-san!!!

      Well...I've been a little slow with writin lately... but I did manage to pull of something... It's a bit small, and Once I get a clearer idea with it, I'll probably add more.  *Update* Added More ^_^   A New Age: Part Three   Each sees the world with their own eyes...  A point of view it seems... To which we all shall live our lives... and gaze into our dreams...  An uncommon sight exists in this world...  A vision owned by few...  A side of life with truth unfurled...  a Side you never knew...  Some say the world is a beautiful place...  Others say it's hell... Except for those who've seen this face... There is no way to tell... What is the truth about our ways?  Are we Savage and cruel?  Or is peace closer day by day and everybody's cool? To knowhow to solve the riddleyou  must seek these people out...  To findfolks out there like me too see what this is about... Find the "losers" of society who won't give up the fight... With open hearts they'll let you see Just whats inside this light... To see this world another way...  To look through troubled eyes...  And see this world is not so dark... Beyond Cerulean Skies...  Even when we reach our prime...  There are courses we won't understand...  but few of us will take the time...  to stop and try to comprehend...  What happens when we go and decide?  Take the path and see it through...  What future have we cast aside...?  Few if any will ever construe...  The other choice they might have made...  Be it good, or be it bad...  In most people's minds the thought will fade...  And forget the influence that they had...  To change this world with what they've done...  Really big or very small...  The difference between the whole and the one...  Who will open his heart... and in darkness... stand tall...

      My newest piece... Take This assholes!(Before someone gets offended... That comment isn't referring to everyone...heheh... ^_^;;)   A New Age: Seeds of Corruption   Life continuesâ¦ as time rolls byâ¦ With a soul to shareâ¦ and wings to flyâ¦. Always searching for something newâ¦. Worlds to createâ¦ and things to doâ¦ This world to me is a beautiful placeâ¦ But evil lingers beneath itâs faceâ¦ Corruptionâs hands stretch so highâ¦ From lowest lakeâ¦ to starry skyâ¦ In the hearts of man this darkness hidesâ¦ When man goes fourth and shows these sidesâ¦ The kindest soul can turn on youâ¦  And take your heart and pierce it throughâ¦ This world is caught in violent debate... They think they rattle the chains of Fateâ¦ A society ravaged by hate and lust...  By abuse and drugs... by actions unjust... Look down below societyâs line...  The people on the bottom of the grapevine... What happens to them if they wish to fly? Their wings are broken... and some of them die... From the cruelty and hate from the world up above...  While the rest down there have hearts filled with love... But still we are ravaged... and still we are mocked...  Our worlds must be cloudy... and our paths are still blockedâ¦ But still we will try to climb up those stairsâ¦  Ignoring the insultsâ¦ and returning the glaresâ¦ But I donât see corruption when I look to their facesâ¦ For we are the same in many many casesâ¦ I look away from the anger, away from the hateâ¦ For I am no longer bound by Fateâ¦ No longer drowning in tears of despair...  I can see the people that existed there... As I drifted through anger and cried to sleep... Falling and falling into the deep...  Of the void that was making a pit in my soul... And I would exist in that terrible hole... I am a victim of corruptions childâ¦ It took sanityâ¦ and made me run wildâ¦ But now they see me another wayâ¦ Most of them are different todayâ¦ They see me as equalâ¦ they see me as me...  They see me as I want to be...  A lover... a Dreamer... a kid just like them... Not a fool or a loser that they can condemn But still some refuse to open their eyesâ¦ And it is a shame that they wonât realizeâ¦ What I have becomeâ¦ and what I will beâ¦ And the ideas and dreams theyâd learn from meâ¦ So go ahead and put me downâ¦ Laugh in my faceâ¦ push me to the groundâ¦ You think you are winningâ¦ but youâre very wrongâ¦ For I will still sing my Dreamerâs songâ¦ I will rise up above youâ¦ and make you payâ¦ For the terrible things that youâve done here todayâ¦ To you I may not be where I amâ¦ Just the fool with the big mouth you continue to damnâ¦ But I will assure youâ¦ your going to failâ¦ For I will still walkâ¦and speak of my taleâ¦ I could be on step one for all that you careâ¦ But when Iâm done everyone will want to be thereâ¦
