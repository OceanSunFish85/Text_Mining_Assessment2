      âGenuine and of the finest quality; 100% pure, high quality Crackmeatâ read the sign outside a Polish butchers.  If Iâm honest, I had no idea about the âgenuine and of the finest qualityâ bit (what was written was an incomprehensible assembly of strange âichâ and âwitzâ sounds). Ok, I admit it: I imagined thatâs what was written, I mean what else can you write on a sausage commercial? What I didnât imagine was the â100% Crackmeatâ that was clearly scrawled in foot long letters on the advert outside the Polish butchers. âCrackmeatâ, what a strange message to see written on the side of a building hidden between the ornately gothic churches of Krakow. Still, it made me chuckle to myself (but no one else apparently). Something tells me that the Polish arenât renown for their amiable and quick-to-laugh characters. Maybe this apparent misery is the burden of the suffering imbedded in their cultural heritage. Or something like thatâ¦I donât know.  Crackmeat aside, Krakow did have a strange feel to it. The sense of history the moment you step into the market-square is astounding. Itâs the largest square in Europe and is listed as an UNESCO World Culture and National Heritage site. Itâs beautiful, but above this grandeur and beautiful architecture a gnawing atmosphere pervades. Maybe itâs because I already know what lies more than an hourâs drive from this market square; a very dark apple indeed.  That feelingâs always hanging in the background. Itâs almost as if Krakow would rather forget that blight in itâs troubled history, but it canât forget and thereâs no turning back on the past. âHe who forgets the past is destined to relive itâ as the placard above one of the many exhibitions to manâs hideousness stated.  Whenever I feel guilty for being attracted to this very black moment in history, I repeat that saying to myself. Sometimes I think that my macabre interest in all of this is in someway voyeuristic or wrong in some other way; I feel guilty, but then itâs not the interest in the mechanics and gruesome details of dying that caused me to travel there, itâs the interest in manâs capacity for hatred. This evil fruit of hatred was not just some random act of madness. To say that it was would be an insult to those who suffered. It would be easier to excuse if this was the case. No, this was not an isolated act of insanity, this was the calculated and systematic torture and slaughter of millions of fellow human beings, thousands have the blood on their hands, millions are culpable of doing nothing at all. This hatred on a mass scale is beyond credulity because it wasnât mass insanity.  I see this place as a warning to the world. A dark landmark. Auschwitz is a place of incomprehensible evil and hatred. For me, the comprehension of the unquestionable hatred that would, for example, experiment with different ways of killing another, be it through gas, fire, hunger or a bullet to the base of the skull, is a source of eternal fear to me, because I can empathise with the emotion of hatred (albeit not to the same extent). Nevertheless, I know, as everyone of us knows, what it is to hate and if I use my imagination, I can see how the guiles of several warped individuals could expound upon everyoneâs hate and sense of inferiority, and give it a target, and give it a name, and compound it with an unquestioning patriotism. I can see how there would be hope in this kind of hate. I can see the love of a country, an anathema called patriotism, in this hate and it deeply scares me.  Coupled with manâs capacity for hatred is the boundlessness of his suffering. Death was sweat relief to many of those in Auschwitz. No one was unmoved, everyoneâs heart bleed as they were lead around the prison within Auschwitz. This was particularly disturbing. We saw the cells where the Germans tested their lethal gas; they wanted to calculate exactly how much gas was to be used â nothing was to be wasted, or the sleep depravation cells, or the starvation cells where Maximillian was taken to. Before you go there, their suffering is just words on a page in some other world, but when I went there I was physically shaken by the realness of it all. As difficult as it is to bare, we must never forget the suffering of the Jewish nation, and of the Jehovahâs witnesses, the lame, the mental unstable, the brave political dissidents condemned for their strength, every one of the six million murdered, so that history is never given the opportunity to repeat itself.

      This blog is about a boy subjected to years of catholic swiss cheese. Now cheese is very nice and all (especially the deep fried with garlic sauce variety - mmm tasty) but when anything is rammed down your throat with very little room for air - something nasty's gonna happen. And it did. On December 25th 1996, just in time for sweet Jesus to lay his head in 'heavenly peace', I regurgitated a semi-mutated hybrid of all things putrid, hypocritical and guilt laden. Why I asked, why has it got so many holes in? In fact, why  just  swiss cheese? What about say; edam, cheddar's very nice, buffalo Mozzarella is just about as close to perfect as a cheese can be, I thought, and then I found the piesta la resistance... I found the holy grail. God, why didn't you tell me about this before: women, drugs, music, cheese on toast, and every cliche known to the modern adolescent.  Now I think I get it. This rich tapestry of life has unfolded. Instead of the mediocrity of cheese, it's hedonistic chocolate all the way baby... Bring it on!  So, I'm very new to all this blogging rubbish, but it looks like fun. So bare with me and occasionally I might pop-up and rant about this big disco ball we call life, the beauty and variety in shines on from it's many surfaces, and just generally, what it means to me, and hopefully, I'll know a little about what it means to you. I imagine there'll be a lot about books (yes, I  am  a worm), a little about drugs, and just an occasional dollop, a mere hint, of something very close to my heart: cheese and chocolate...
