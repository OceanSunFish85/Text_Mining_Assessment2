       unLEASHING the 9/11 CommissionReport   The official 9/11 Commission's findings have been made public in a570 pagereport this morning. Our government should be ashamed of its intelligence failures, yet at the same time, we need to be optimistic for the future and prepare for the worst. Chairman Thomas Kean of the panel stated that the "United States government was simply not active enough in combating the terrorist threat before 9/11" and that U.S. officials had a "failure of imagination" in understanding the threat posed by al Qaeda before the attacks. The independent commission did not specifically blame either the Bush or Clinton administrations but rather our government's general intelligence capabilities as a whole.

       my SCOOP on MARTHA'S MESS       Asyou are probably all well aware, Martha Stewart, America's favorite criminal/homemaker/cook/gardener/CEO-businesswoman Martha Stewart has been sentenced to five months in a federal penitentiary, five months of home confinement, $30k fine, and 2 years probation for her scheme with the ImClone stock-selling. Peter Bacanovic, her former broker, hasalso received a 5-month sentence. While we all have our views on Martha I would like to comment on how the media and the federal government went so far out of their way to degrade this woman as much as they possibly could. It is rumored that if it weren't for the rivalry between state and federal government officials on charging people as severely as possible, she would not be in this deep. After the collapse of Enron and the injustice Ken Lay and his sleezbag corporate pals did to the employees and stock-holders there, I think the government is trying to convey a message. The government wants to make an example of a person like Martha Stewart to discourage any more business scandals. While I believe the government  should  be hunting down"white collar" criminals, I don't believe that it should be allowed to "create" a case and ruin a possibly innocent person's career. Then again, thats just my opinion.

       "You're Fired!!!"   Thats right, Donald Trump couldn't pick a better time than now to use his copyrighted catch phrase, becauseladies and gentlemen, it's happened again. Criticize the President, feel the wrath. Remember the Dixie Chicks and how they were "ashamed Bush is from Texas." I'm suretheir recording studioswere ashamed too...of their  record sales , after that episode. Then came Whoppi Goldberg and heranti-Bush remarks. Well, let me just say "You're fired!" Yes, her contract was killed. Now we have a Las Vegas performer, Linda Ronstadt, thrown out of a Casino (and never welcome back, says the owner) for dedicating a song to Michael Moore. I guess it's one thing to take politics to the extreme, but this is a democracy, not a Communist dictatorship. After all,our currentpresident'sfather killed that kind of government (well, at least he took credit for it in his '92 State of the Union). In my opinion, they'resaving the weapons of mass destructionso they can unleash them on Michael Moore if Bush loses the election. I guess free speech is just ... limited ... these days.

       35th Anniversary of the First Moon Landing        "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."    --Neil Armstrong,   July 20, 1969       As described by President Nixon,  "For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, the people of this Earth are truly one."  It's been 35 years since that historical moment in history that so many Americans remember so clearly. Back then it was a fascination and a dream come true. Today, it is seen as the past: when President Bush expressed his hope for another lunar landing, thegeneral American response was boredom. Maybe it is the fact that there is not much exciting exploration left to be done. Then again it might be that the moon is not as interesting as, say, Saturn and the other planets we are now exploring. Nevertheless, July 20, 1969, will be a date America and the world remembers as the day we opened the door to space exploration.

       my SCOOP on Michael Moore and his"Fahrenheit 9/11"    He's the winner of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. He's been calledeverything from a brilliant producer to liberal lying trash and just about everything in between. He's been called the liberal Rush Limbaugh and a political voice of Hollywood. He's Michael Moore, creator of the hot new controversial film, Fahrenheit 9/11. The documentary indicts George W. Bush and his administration on our intelligence failures that lead to 9/11 and introduces far-fetched allegations that alarm some and are dismissed as lies by others. The film's controversy sparks in the middle of a hot summer before a hot election. Experts say that this movie may open the door to more politically-motivated movies and documentaries. I haven't seen the movie yet but hope too soon. I can only assume that the Bush family has not yet seen it either.

       my SCOOP on the Death of the Marriage Amendment...       Let me first say that regardless of my views on gay marriage in this country,its moral implicationsare not the primary concern here. All this was, was a not so ingenious plan bysome panicking Republicansto further divide voters on issues that will create stronger party lines just in time for the November election. They knew as well as we did that it would not pass, but it created some heat -- some debate. The more divisive people are this political season the more likely they are to remain firm on supporting one candidate (and not changing their views). Bush, the "conservative, Christian patriot" would take the credit for at least trying to pass the amendment as he blames Kerry, the "liberal, immoral flip-flopper"for not doing so. Even if Kerry is our president next year, wouldn't it be a wonderful thing to attack him with? Nice try, Bush (or should I say Karl Rove?).    What can we conclude? Election year  razzle dazzle  ... don't you love the drama?

       Cheney Visit   I had a wonderful opportunity this month to meet the Vice President of the United States at a campaign rally in West Virginiavery close to home. VP Cheney talked mainly about economic revival and homeland security. Of course, there was some Kerry-bashing too, but hey, that makes it fun! All in all, it was a great experience that I will always remember.

       WELCOME!   This summer has been so busy and I finally have a free day. Turns out its been so boring it's driving me crazier than when I actually work! Anyways, I've decided to start back up this blog after some serious reconstruction and deleting. I hope to create a journal as well as a page for my own editorials on current events, politics, philosophy, etc. I will also try to include links to some interesting and/or important must-see web sites. Thanks for visiting and come back soon to check my progress!
