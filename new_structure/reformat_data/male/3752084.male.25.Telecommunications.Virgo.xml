						   Have you ever watched one of those prescription drug ads carefully? They are stupid!! Hereâs a sampleâ¦  â[sales pitch]â¦Ziploc OTG will cure your migraine problem forever in weeksâ¦.[more sales pitch] Ask your doctor if Ziploc OTG is right for you. Known side effects include congestive heart failure; chest pain; vision imbalance; mild depression; and hypotension have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Rare cases of bronchospasm, angiodema and stroke have also been reported.â  Man, that thing sounds more like a killing machine than a drug. Iâd rather live my entire life with migraines. Can you imagine anyone actually considering using this drug after seeing the ad?  âHmmmâ¦. Honey do you think I should ask our doctor about Ziploc OTG?â    âJohn, what about the side effects?â  âOh sweetheart, the side effects are not that serious. Its just possibilities of heart failure, stroke, blindness, choked lungs and swellings â¦ all those things happen to only one in 100 patients anyway!!â  Amen!

						   Have you ever leased a car, by any chance? No? Good!! I just did. The fat salesman at the BMW showroom never told me that I could drive only 15,000 miles a year. Now, when it comes to numbers, there is this something about me, I have to obey them. I bow to their sacred powers, especially if they have to do anything with green bills. I am the guy who turns his cell phone off towards the end of the month.   Anyway, so the other day I was on my way to the movie theater when Neal called and said âDude, I am at the airport, could you come pick me up?â. Now I was thinking âThe airport? Thatâs 11.79 miles away. You know what that means? I canât go to grocery store or the gym tomorrow!â After a couple of minutes of contemplation, I heard Nealâs voice âYou there?â and I said in a moribund tone âYeah, Iâll pick you up!â  On my way to the airport I realized to my shock that I was wrong about my calculation. Its not 11.79 miles, its 12.45 miles [High Pitch]!! Oh my god, this couldnât be happening. So I pull over in panic and this cop pulls over behind me, gets out of his car, and comes over to my door. Iâm looking in the mirror and thinking, âShit, I should have shaved, now heâs going to think Iâm Al Qaeda trying to bomb this milestoneâ.  The officer asked in his husky voice, âIs everything alright, sir?â And Iâm thinking âNooooooo, I miscalculated, you dumb ass, canât you see?? Havenât  you  ever leased a car?â Trying hard to sound calm, I said âIâm fine, just a panic attackâ. So then he said âSir are you sure you can drive, if not I suggest that you call a friend to drive you home.â And Iâm thinking âNo way! I am out of cell phone minutes!â Now I get enraged! All I remember now is that I did use some sacrilegious and unwarranted adjectives when I told the cop to leave me alone.  Oh yes, by the way Neal did bail me out the next morning!  Have a great 4th of July !
