						   Okay, I'm blogging. Read about it; wondered about it; though about doing it, but it always seemed so useless. Random thoughts jettisoned into the great abyss of the internet, never to be read by anyone and definitely limited in articulation and/or literary skill. Oh well, random thoughts aren't meant to be taken so seriously anyway. So what to talk about. My phone was dead yesterday, so I call the service provider that I subscribe t.v., internet, phone, etc. from and they tell me they will have someone out here this morning. This evening I get home from work and the phone is still dead. Called the company again and they said they didn't know when the truck would get here, but they would let someone know again. So far, so good. I run to the store and I am pleasantly surprised to see a service truck in my driveway when I get back. The guy asks me if I know that I have a message on my voice mail. "No", I respond, "I don't have a dial tone so I haven't been able to check the voice mail." He tells me, "Well, you might now, so you better get the message before I get to work." I still don't have a dial tone so I call on my cell phone to retrieve my messages. Guess who? The first guy who came earlier to work on the phone. He tells me he disconnected the line and they will be back to work on it tomorrow. Now think about it. How did he expect me to get the message? And I have to wonder, "How much are they paying THAT guy?" Oh well, a gentle rant.

						    Just got through reading USA Today and came across a heart-warming article about those wonderful specimens of humanity whose cheese slides off their cracker and have decided that the way to make everything right in their world is by taking a few people out of this one. Of particular interest was the quotes of some of the people who are currently cooling their jets in a crossbar hotel somewhere. Here is a sample:        "I was a very immature person and hadn't mastered the art of telling evil, 'No, I'm not rendering myself to your service."     --Judy Gordan, a former McDonald's cook serving life sentence for a 1996 shooting that wounded two employees and killed a teenage worker in Vallhjo, Calif. All were shot in the head.           Well, guess what Judy? Evil didn't put a gun to the head of three people and attempt to scramble their brains like breakfast eggs with a bullet. You did. And so you can master the art of telling your cellmate, "But I don't swing that way."        "I had just given up. No one needed me. My children didn't need me. I felt like no one needed me,... I wish I could turn back the clock, but that's impossible."     --denies Hosinger, former bar worker, sentenced to life in prison for her participation in the 1994 execution-style slaying of four in Virginia Beach, Va.     Ah, denies. Did the four people that were killed by your boyfriend need any one as you screamed, "Do it! Do it!" when he shot them in the back of the head as they lay with their foreheads pressed to the floor? Yes, they did, but unfortunately, there was no one to help them. You may be wishing you could turn the clock forward about half-way through your life imprisonment. Bottom line; we don't need you. No one needs you.  "The Bible tells us that we are all sinners-- that no one is perfect. I know I'm not! Even our little sins are an abomination to God."    --Ramon Salcido, on death row for fatally shooting, stabbing, and beating seven people, including two of his young daughters, in 1989 in Sonoma County, Calif.     Wow, Ramon! Apparently you have found Jesus while incarcerated. That is wonderful! The Bible teaches that if you are truly repentant you will go to heaven and that is a good thing. However, even if you are repentant, you still have to pay the consequences of your actions in this world. Get cozy. You ain't going nowhere for awhile.        Give me a break!! Is Texas the only place where people get it? It ain't about retrubution. It ain't about prevention. It's about getting rid of people who break the social contract. If you kill someone, you don't get to play anymore. You go to prison for the rest of your life and in many states, we end that life as soon as all your appeals are exhausted. Don't like that you say? DON'T KILL PEOPLE!
