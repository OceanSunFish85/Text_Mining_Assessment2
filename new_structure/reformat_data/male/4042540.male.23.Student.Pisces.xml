      Michael Moore gives a speech in Boston:     "This whole experience with Disney not releasing the film and it's like what--you know, the film has gone on now to make more money than any Disney film this year. And it's like--(applause)--it shocked me at the time, because the way I have been able to get my work out there over the years is that usually when the media companies, greed always supercedes politics or personal animosity toward me. Oh, I can't stand the guy. Oh, how many books did he sell last week? Well, ok. Print a few more.   You know this incredible flaw of capitalism that has always worked in my favor. [laughter] You know the old saying that the rich man will sell you the hope to hang yourself with if he can make a dollar off it? That will eventually be their undoing. But this time it didn't happen. This time a film made for a very small amount of money that will now make, you know, at least a quarter billion dollars around the world by the time it's done, [cheers] the greed didn't motivate them to release this film.   I couldn't figure it out for the longest time and it took a Canadian journalist to finally do the story and thank god for the Canadians, you know? (applause) they are just like us. Only better. [laughter] They are sort of like the red sox. You know? Their time will come. They like us. The Canadians really do like us. They just wish we would read a little more."

      Have you ever found yourself waiting at a traffic light after you've hit the cross-walk button? Probably, because that's what people do when they're standing on the curb. They're waiting for the light to change. Then you get these people that come late to the cross-walk, see you standing there dutifully waiting for the light to change, and then they hit the button again. Sometimes they click the button a number of times.   What's the deal with that? Will clicking the button more times make the light turn faster? If so, I've never heard it. And what do those people think when they see somebody standing on the curb? Don't they think they've already hit the button? Most annoying thing ever.(Actually it's not as annoying as trying to sleep with drunken guyswalkingdown the street yelling that Italian soccer anthem. Now THAT'S annoying.)    Jimmy Carter's Closet    As most people in North America know, the DemocraticNational Conference is underway. Critics are hailing the speech of Bill Clinton, while Gore makes out with his wife onstage and Jimmy Carter wonders where his Nobel Prize is. Here's a bit of his speech:   "When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken. After 9/11, America stood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as all this goodwill has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations. Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States from the very nations we need to join us in combating terrorism."   urlLink Tony Pierce  said of him:    "First of all, jimmy carter's old, and he's been building houses for the poor while you're buying complete seasons of friends on dvd through amazon. He'll be 81 years old come rocktober. Carter was in the navy for eight years.   "I served under two presidents," Carter says. "Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, men who represented different political parties, both of whom who faced their active military responsibilities - with honor."   What Jimmy Carter tonight reminds us is that every once in a while it might be a good idea to have a president who not only was a real military veteran, but one who could also win a nobel peace prize, and earn it."

      Saw  I, Robot  last week. Normally I try and avoid summer movies, but my brother wanted to see it and besides, I'm planning on writing an upcoming article on artifical intelligence.   What's the deal with artificial intelligence anyway? We seem to have a death-wish with technology if you look at the movies and books being written about the prospect. There always seems to be a familiar scenario: man creates robots as slaves, man enjoys his new life of treating robots like dirt, robots rise up and destroy infidel humans.    The Terminator  is a good example,which ties in theidea ofa new missile defence program "Skynet"deciding humans are thebiggest threat to its survival. Humans = target.  Then there's  the Matrix , where humans decide robots aren't worth co-existing with, so the robots have no choice but to try and exterminate them (as seen in the prequel to the movies, The Animatrix).   And now there's  I, Robot . If you don't want to know the big twist at the end of the story, then I suggest you skip this part. Basically, it's the year 2035 and humans have once again engineered a population of polite, retro-looking robots to do humanity's bidding. Along with these robots comes the big centralized computer system with a mind of it's own (VICKI) that decides the best way to protect humans is to protect them from themselves. Enter: Will Smith and his one liners to save the day. What's the deal with those one-liners? They're totally unneccesary. I can't think of a single movie where one-liners were actually funny or enhanced the story. (Okay maybe  Die Hard ...and  James Bond ).   Anyway, I actually enjoyed the movie. Better than most summer blockbusters, and definitely better than Will Smith's last summer movie,  The Wild Wild West . The underlying message which cropped up again (as with  The Matrix  and  The Terminator  and other post-modern films of this nature) is that humans are like little children that need to be either destroyed or saved, aswe can't seem to sustain ourselves. Interestingly enough, in I, Robot,  VICKI's logic wasn't actually flawed (which she proclaimed as Will shoved some poisonous nano-bots into her brain). But the robots were seen as evil because the only way to save humansfrom themselves was to limit their own freedom -- which includes thefreedom to make mistakes.   And maybe that'swhat defines freedom in the end.     Some kind of hipster    I learned two things about myself today.   1) Paris Hilton (one of the most annoying celebrities ever) is 11 days older than me.   2) According to a poll, I'm a --       "You are the Low-Fidelity All-Star. You were born with your cool, and it's totally natural. You run the gamut from Hipster Supreme (only they can ingest as much coffee as you) to the geeky hipster (Mario Kart, anyone?)."    That's kinda odd because I don't really drink coffee or smoke. But I do enjoy Mario Kart now and then...

          Oh yeah, and here's my latest article for Somethingcool News, entitled "The Cell-phone Addiction."  urlLink http://www.somethingcool.ca/secondary70.htm     "His name was Sven. Or maybe it was Hans. Either way, he was a German visiting Canada with a friend that happened to be at this event and who found himself in a conversation with me. I remember it was going well, as his English was much more understandable than the tight sweater he was wearing. At one point I felt my pager begin to vibrate in my pocket, and I casually retrieved the device to view the incoming phone number. Much to my surprise, the German laughed incredulously and remarked, "Is that a pager? I did not know they still made those!" He then insisted on fondling it like a relic from the dark ages, little more than a quaint antique. And I couldn't help but wonder whether I had been insulted by the new breed of elitist - the technology snob. " I was a little worried about writing this article actually, because people can be pretty protective of their technology. And then there's the hypocrisy aspect -- as my argument asserts that people who love this type of technology are addicted to it -- because I probably spend at least ten hours per day in front of a computer screen. (Granted, 8 of those hours are at work.)   That's it, time for the beach.

      Well here I am trying out the new blog. I'm actually not sure why I didn't open up a Blogger account before, seeing as how this is much easier than creating my own blogging page. I think I was just generally conflicted. On the one hand, there's the people that say doing this is pointless unless you're someone famous or have a unique point of view. Otherwise, who cares what I think about stuff?   Then again, what justifies doing anything at all? Money? Fame? If so, then there are a lot of things in this world that would never have happened. I'm pretty sure it was Stephen King who wrote a nice piece of advice to aspiring writers. He said that if you write for money, you'll never be able to write very well. But if you write for the love of writing, then people will take notice and perhaps riches will follow.   Anyway here's a good article.    The glorification of the "good war" persists on our television and movie screens, in the press, in the pretentious speeches by politicians. The more ugly the stories that come out of Iraq â the bombing of civilians, the mutilation of children, the invasion of homes, and now the torture of prisoners â the more urgent it is for our government to try to crowd out all those images with the triumphant stories of D-Day and World War II.  Read it if you have time.  urlLink http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/19317/
