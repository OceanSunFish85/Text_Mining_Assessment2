        16 Stone, 5lbs (229lbs / 104Kg)    This is my 'starting weight', some 3-4 stone greater than most medical / health guides would advise.  To put another way, my weight is  136% , that's a  quarter  of me that shouldn't be here!  Me thinks this is going to be a long haul, but worth it in the end.  In addition to the health benefits I caught sight of myself in the bathroom mirror, not a pretty sight.  If I were to sunbathe on a beach I could find myself being pushed back into the sea by the likes of Greenpeace, or listening out for the shout 'harpoon'.   Ah well, pass the rice cakes...

        Whatâs a Blog?   The definition that I use is an online journal, a public place to record events or opinions. I intend to use this Blog for a number of topics, mostly along the lines of self improvement with an element of fun.    The Diet.   This Blog will be a public declaration of intent and progress with my diet. According to both my waistline and Body Mass Index I am obese! Itâs not a pretty sight. I should weigh somewhere between 12 and 13 stones (168-182lbs). My initial target is to get below 13 stone, depending on how I feel, look and the effort whether I continue to 12 stone.  I intend to âweigh inâ every Saturday morning and post the progress here on the ânet.  I am using the âweight watchersâ points system, along with moderate exercise. I will also make note of progress with exercise in this Blog to keep me at it.    Film Reviews.   For many years my wife and I went to the cinema nearly every week, but this ceased for a number of reasons. To reclaim a little of that âwork / lifeâ balance I hear so much about - and admit to have lost lately â we intend to watch a movie at the cinema most weeks. Normally this would be on a Friday night to signal the end of the week and help me wind down.  If we donât make it to the cinema then we'll hire a movie and Iâll review that one.    Photography.   An old hobby of mine is photography, which I have not really practised for a few years now. Having treated myself to a new digital SLR camera this site will give me the opportunity â and incentive â to get out there and take some photos worth showing off to the world.      News, Web  Personal Blog.   I read a fair bit of news on-line, and Iâd like to make note of the things that interest me or catch my eye. Some may be serious, others daft. Any on-line curios I find will also be logged here. I may also add the odd personal observation on life and my activities in the off-line world.

       15st 13lb!  (223lb/101Kg).     2lbs more - or less - gone!     Broken the 16 stone barrier! Ok only by a pound but still under 16 stone! This was the highest reading on the now infamous digital scales.    Having been unwell for a couple of weeks seems to have had some positive effect. I've stopped eating chocolate and I've only had a handful of crisps - normally from a packet of Maria's - in the same time. I have also been drinking lots of water, taking 2 liters of bottled water to work and having no tea.    Thing is Iam off work this coming week, and the plan is to go out and about which may - hopefully - involve a few meals ( pub lunches) and erratic eating.    We've also treated ourselves to a 'fat free' electric grill to aid the healthy eating plan. Yes it does cook it and most if not all of the fat drains away - just that it cooks darn quick, too darn quick. Also things seem to shrink a little more. Anyhow lots of experimenting to do!    Comment from mother tonight while offering to cook father a treacle sponge pudding - eating is a habit. Me thinks she might be right.    Ah well, next mile stone is to get my Body Mass Index under 30, above which one is classified as obese. Hopefully next week.

       16st 1lb , (225lbs/102Kg)  Well it's gone down.  I didn't breach the 16st barrier this week but at least it went down.  This is a little disheartening considering on Tuesday (6 July) I weighed in at 15st 9lbs! - Mind you I had been ill, and have spent a while getting the fluids back in and regaining an appetite.  Eating plain baked and mashed potato because I was to afraid for anything more exotic !  Hopefully back to proper foods next week and back to watching the points.   Maybe next week 15...

       For the birds ... and cats   This is our contribution to helping British wildlife -  urlLink Bill Oddie and the BBC  have a lot to answer for - It weights a ton and dominates or back garden.  It is greatly apprecated at present by a large group of Starlings, a very nervous Blackbird and two young kittens.   .

       Weigh In 16st 2lbs . (226lbs/103kg)   3lbs gone!  ( 44 to go... )  A small cheer.  Yes I am pleased it's gone down, I just wish the scales would agree on the amount.  I am reminded of the saying " A man with a watch knows the time, a man with two is never sure ".  I have a set of digital bathroom scales - easier to read with bleary eyes first thing in the morning - which can't seem to make their mind up.   The options were 16-3, 16-2, 16-1 and 15-12.  16-2 came up more times than the rest.  I even got out the old spring scales and squinted to read them - it looked like 16-1, but I'm going for the average.  I suspect that the sensitivity of the digital ones reduces the higher the weight.  This is not bad considering I have not been really trying that hard.  It's been an ' absorbing ' week at work, so I suspect nervous energy has something to do with it.  I've run out of sugar cubes at work so that is a small contribution.  I was trying to give up chocolate but my wife came home with 7-8 bars of kit-kat and a similar number of flakes - apparently going cheap due to short shelf life - so I am rationing myself to one a day...  Maybe break the 16st barrier next week?   Where's my muesli...

       Watched at Cinema 2nd July 2004   A good laughâ¦hmm, yes I laughed, butâ¦something missing, or maybe I was expecting too much?  Or did it seem to wander?    Yes itâs a good film, with a story line â a  severe  reworking of a few fairy-tail clichÃ©s â and lots going on.  Itâs almost play spot the movie, with scenes borrowed(?) from â Alien, Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters/Jurassic Park and a few from the Lord of the Rings trilogy â especially Return of the King.  Maybe I need to watch it again, I think I was too wrapped up in the story waiting for the fairy godmother to get her come-uppance â  now thereâs a twist.   The kids will love it, and all will laugh together.    The animation as always from Dreamworks is great, you forget that you are watching a cartoon after a while.  Oh yes â wait for the credits â I wonât spoilt it, worth the waitâ¦poor old Donkey.   Beware cute kittens, Gribbit, Gribbit.    Rating: 7/10  â One for the DVD collection.
