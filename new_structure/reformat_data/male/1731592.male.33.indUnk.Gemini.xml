      Today, I received a disturbing phone call from my mother before leaving for work.  She called to tell me that my Aunt Mary was diagnosed with terminal cancer throughout her spinal cord...  Not a good day at all. Although I have not been in constant contact with my family over the recent years, it still is horrifying to know that soon someone that I grew up knowing all my life will no longer be with 'us' the family any more.  That is scary beyond anything that I could write here.  I work a lot  everyday, I have a routine that I follow to make the best of my days  evenings.  Be it at work or at home.  I'd like to think that I make some positive impressions on people I meet.  My Aunt Mary when I was younger was one of those people.  Positive impressions left...   I can fondly remember visiting all of my aunts  uncles frequently as I was growing up, my brother  I that is.  Getting to know our cousins  having a grand time! Seeing someone everyday, be it at home or at school was really what a lot of memories consist of.  The extended family of local cousins that 'we' my bro  I interacted with everyday is a fine memory even to this day.  It really saddens me to think, of the mortal barriers  the way life has lead me down roads I did not think I would ever travel, but here I am anyways.  To grow apart  away from all that I once knew as a boy is crazy.  But it happened.  I'll end this note, not with a said thought but a positive one.  I will always be grateful that as I got bigger that I could remember more people that I met.  That I now, have the chance to say 'good bye'  'see' my Aunt Mary before she leaves this world.  I hope...  Some never get that chance, maybe I still have time. I remember her fondly  know now that my thoughts are never truly that far away from my 'roots'  family... I never forgot my Aunt,  now I know I never will... Talk to you all soon...

      Greetings!  Here I am finally out in the world of the internet with a space to call my own.  As I figure more  more of the features out I will try to improve on the appearance  the content.  For now I will be content to have a spot for me, where I can write down my random thoughts  reflect on them.  I chose to call the blog 'Scrolls Of The Vault' for really, anything that is shared over a forum such as this could be considered a snippet of who I am  where Im heading.  For those that know me, I hope this is another avenue into me... Mutlore

      Well, I finally figured out how to fix the links on the page, my whole two!  Heheh... well their working at least!  I'll add a few more later on, they are sites that I enjoy  are part of my hobbies or interests.  Starwars is big for me, I really enjoy the movies!  As for the Marvel Hero Clix, it's a game that I play with a few friends of mine, more of a strategy game with superhero's.  Yeah, it's childish, but I dont get a  lot of free time to be a kid lately.  Nothing really new with me same old same.  Here's a topic that I hear a lot about from friends  family.  DEPRESSION...  Sound fun?  Didnt think so.  It's my early impression that maybe I suffer from a little of the big 'D' word myself currently.  Is it a major case?  Im not sure, but I know I do get tired of the same things daily.  Not a lot of time for 'ME' I guess?!   At work, I try to be the same wacky person, that I usually am.  But, I can sometimes look back especially at HW  sort of weird myself out  say "hey I have no clue what I just did or said for that customer" Weird feeling to have, kind of like deja Vu but not?  You know?  Didnt think so... I dont know either!  Anyways, it's happened more  more recently  it cant be good.  I do keep trying to make the best of things that come my way though.  Hmmm, what else can I dream up?  Well, my children are coming tomorrow morning  spending the day with their Dad!  That should cheer me up!  I love my kids dearly  I hope that they always know that, even though I dont get to spend the time that I should.  Heres hoping that tomorrow is a fun  cheery day!  Maybe if it's nice we'll be able to go spend some time at the parks  play basketball with my son!  He likes to show his old Dad up  play me.  He really is a mini-me in a lot of ways.  He makes me laugh!  My daughter is wild  loves the park  playing on all the swings  such.  She's like me when it comes to movies  spending quiet time!  Well, lets hope I can be fun to hang out with  not too boring.  We'll talk again soon...

      Great, Im back!  Last few days have been pretty good!  Spent all day Wednesday with my kids, had a fun day just veggin out in front of the t.v. watching movies  trying to stay cool.  Worked during the day today  everything went by rather quickly.  Did not even find time to be bored.  Branden showed up a 'little' late, hehe not to slam him but he called at 1 ish to say he over slept!  Was all good though everything got done  the day is over.  He felt pretty bad,  I really did not mind.  He's a good guy.   Found out from Kevin, one of the guys I work with at HW that I have some 'worm' that infects PC's if they are just, browsing the net!  Dont need to open an email or anything!  Wowzers, it was rebooting my pc every 5 minutes or so, whenever I would connect to the internet.  He was nice enough to tell me about it  had 2 floppys with the fix  prevention on them.  So, Im all good again, up and running.  Reason, I caught the virus?  Im a smuck  did not have the Windows XP default firewall running in the background...  I'll steal a page from Branden's blog  post my schedule for the next few days if anyone wants to know where I'll be.  Friday     :  9am - 2pm Taco John's / 3:30pm - 12:30am Hollywood Saturday:  Off Taco John's / Off Hollywood Sunday  :  Off Taco John's / 3:30pm - 12:30 am Hollywood  Hopefully I'll have fun this weekend, who knows?  Other news, my wife is heading to Nebraska with her mom  dad for an upcomming weekend Aug 22 - 24 so that should at least be different.  Talk soon.

      Wow, the world never stops turning  I'm starting to believe that there might not ever be any terrific news for me to talk about...  On Friday afternoon I received a horrible call from my mother.  She was upset  her voice was broken in places  before she told me, my heart actually leapt into my throat...  One can only imagine the worse when someone is in that state  a son can 'tell' when things have beaten someone to the edge.  My Aunt Mary has passed away...  Blown away.  Not sure.  Stunned.  Were just a few of the things that passed through my head.  My word, it all happened too fast for me to wrap my mind around it.  This has been the first time in a long, long time that anyone this 'close' to me in our family has passed away.  It leaves me without someone that I literally grew up with  seen all my days when I was a boy  a teen.   Left behind we all are... I've been told that my Aunt was in a lot of pain  now that suffering has concluded.  Does hearing that make me feel any better?  A little... but now I feel strangely guilty that I did not get to see her a few more times before the end.  So being an adult now  reflecting back now,  recalling memories of her  all the fun times that were had it's hard to believe that she is really gone.  The mortatility of us all has been brought to the forefront for me,  I'm sure it's just human nature in general that causes to think in the back of our minds that our loved ones will always be there for us...  Arrogant, me.  Things will move on  I will always remember my Aunt fondly.  In an earlier post I spoke of good 'impressions left'.  In that light I will be grateful that I was given those early opportunities to get to know a great all around person,  especially a 'cool' Aunt...  I will never forget you Aunt Mary, I regret that my life now did not have time for my kids to get to know you better...  My heart runs out to my mother, she has lost a sister  a dear friend.  It has to be a tough situation to go through.  Today we went to visit my mom  dad, in Gresham... The kids,  the wife  I...  It had been a long while since I had found the time to come home  visit.  Horrible that it takes a tragedy to bring me home.  Had the chance to visit with my brother  my Aunt Peg, whom I had not seen in a long time!  So that was a pleasant surprise.  Heard stories from Aunt Peg  my mom, remembering Aunt Mary.  That was nice to hear from someone else's perspective.  Back to a thought, I'd like to write down before it passes me by...  My mom had lost a brother a long time ago.  Not sure, how long ago maybe 20 years ago or closer?  At any rate, at that time I was a little boy  did not 'known' my uncle that well.  So it did not strike me as closely.  Nor did I understand everything as well.  But this time, it runs closer for me at least.  It breaks my heart to see my mom in pain  there is nothing that I can do for her.  My wife Kat, says that 'You can just be there for her to listen'  that sounds like good intentions... It's so hard, because I come from the school of thought of 'making things better'  there just is no making this better.    Well, in a lighter tone.  I did not explain to my kids why we were going to visit their grandma  grandpa... So they had a lot of fun visiting!  They really get a charge out of their Uncle Justy  the grandparents!  They even got to meet Aunt Peg!  Of course, they had met her when they were just little babies, but thats just not the same as they get older.  She gave Jordy  Casey lots of stories  marveled at how big they had gotten!  Those two hams were living it up... heheh...   their Uncle Justy was giving their dad a hard time with lots of stories  jokes, so I think they liked that as well.  I had a good day with the kids  my family...  Just wish it did not take a death to remember that we all need to live  love one another.  I will never forget my Aunt  after seeing Aunt Peg again, I think I'm starting to understand just a tinkling...  That our family might be out of sight  we rarely see one another, but our Aunts/Uncles never forget the little people we used to be  that they still think of us  even love us...  Here's hoping that the 'tinkling' will continue to grow  that everyone knows that I hold all of my family dear to me, even though I do not get to visit them regularly.  Talk to everyone soon.

      Well, here it is on the eve of Kat (wife) heading out of town for the weekend to visit her kids in Nebraska with her Dad  Mom.  Wow, what a  long car ride that is!  If I remember correctly its like 10-12 hours one way!  Least they are taking her parents van, that should make it a lot more comfortable with the heat,  being couped up for hours like that.  Hopefully Kat will have a nice visit with her daughter  son, both are in their teens.  I want to say 17  maybe 15?  Dont quote me on that though.  Been going crazy with DC Hero Clix lately!  Before I was just collecting the Marvel ones, but as my friends call it: "you've turned to the dark side".   Errrr... meaning I broke my cardinal rule of not wanting DC figures.  Currently my favorite figure is the Green Lantern - John Stuart.  He rocks hardcore!  If you've never 'tried' hero clix or clicked on the link to Wizkids website, it's a nice strategy game that is completely collectible.  That combination, has made it difficult on my wallet...  Fun game, if your remotely interested in Comics or strategy games.  Competed in a DC Booster Draft tournament at "Galaxy Of Games' in Appleton on Wednesday night!  Had a blast meeting a bunch of other 'Geeks' that play Clixs!  Finished with 2 Wins / 1 Loss.  Had the chance to get a bunch of new figures that I did not have  learn some new strategys.  First match was against Tom, a good friend of mine!  Heheh, like we dont play each other enough already?!  He had some awesome guys notably Veteran Wonderwoman  Experienced Green Lantern!  He taught me the hard way how to use the power of  phasing  what I call the 'The Woman' hehe... I barely killed one lowly piece against him!  He cracked my Veteran Green Lantern's hips early  the game was basically over from that point on.   Results?  Loss for me, but he gave me some tips after the game on how to utilize the team I had drafted for the next matches which helped a TON!  Second match was against a guy named Joe, first time meeting him.  From the start, I could see that on 'paper' my team was superior  with my new strategies in place  some semi decent dice rolls I might be victorious.  Figures of note on his side that I recall was the Veteran Circi  2 Rookie Cheetah's.  Well, with the mobility of my team,  the lack of thereof for his squad battles would take place on my terms.  With 2 outwitters on my squad I pretty much set out to neatralize the powers of his 2 Cheetah's so they could not get a good roll  'junk' one of my figures...  Decent rolling on my part,  poor rolling  tactics on his part resulted in me systematically taking down his figures rather quickly.  Green Lantern rocks  I could move back  heal whenever I wanted to.  Wiped out his entire team with only losing 1 guy!  Wooo hoo!  Results win for me  meeting a new hero clix player!  Third match was against another one of my friends Shannon!  Wow, I got the chance to play 2 of my friends that I play all the time in Clix! heheh... Sarcasm intended...  Shannon has to be the luckiest booster buyer on the planet.  It seems that he always get a unique figure or 2 when he gets packs.  Tonight was no different.  Pulled 2 uniques!  1 was a Superman that I had never seen before that was the 'dark' Superman...  Lets put it this way, SUPER beat down man!!!  Figures of note on his team was Superman Unique  one other figure that could mind control, Veteran figure Female cant remember the name of her.  But with 2 figures I knew he would be in trouble because with my full team of 6 I would not have to 'struggle' to do things  my team was again more mobile than the opponents.  The game started with me botching my first move  trying to get further away from 'The Man' (supes) so that he would have to move to come to me  then I could spank him first.... well that did not work out so well, because I was indoors and not a lot of room for my team to get in proper formation, so I ended up 2nd turn moving back to starting postion...  By that time Supes had arrived and got the first 'wack' in on my figures!  Shannon mind controlled my Green Lantern to shoot one of my own figures and critically missed after taking controll and then wounding my GL in the process!!  Grrr, that sucked.  Then Supes flew in and wacked on my front line guys dropping him in one shot!  Was worried for a minute, then I started turning off powers and dropped his Mind Control girl... Then it was supes by himself  he could not move and attack me any more so I just picked him off at my leisure!  Result win for me!  Got to see SUPES!!  Ended up being voted 'Fellowship' Player of the night (best sportsman)  received a limited edition figure...  was a fun night!  Sorry to bore everyone, but Clix is intersting to me!  Talk soon.  Work schedule  8/22  Friday     10:00am-2:00pm TJ's/ 3:30pm-12:30am HW 8/23  Saturday OFF                     TJ's/ 7:00pm- 4:00am HW  Full Rental Inventory 8/24  Sunday    OFF                    TJ's/  3:30pm-12:30am HW

      Hello!  Things have been looking up lately, wife  I are doing great.  Think both of us are trying to be more attentive to one another.  So that is always a good thing.  Maybe things will be better overall for me!  *crosses fingers*   Kat, (wife) bought me a new wedding band today, that was good!  The old one was loose and I do not particularly care for gold and the old design.  Now it's just a plain silver band which I like a lot more!  I'm not a big jewelry person in general, this ring does not 'feel' like I'm wearing one like the old one did?  Maybe I'm just weird.  Had a falling out, sort of with Branden  Nick at HW, guess it was just a misunderstanding.  Things are back to 'normal' on my end,  it seems that way for Nick  'B'.  'B' really bailed me out tonight when another guy did not know he had to work, so that was waaaaay, cool in my book!  Was a good night working with Schaefer  him talked a lot about movies  videos games.  Was all good, one of the better nights lately.  Have off Wednesday  Thursday, that will be odd.  Kids coming on Wed. so that should be a great day.  Will have to figure out what do with my Thursday, maybe go play some Hero Clix with some of my friends during the day.   Decided to take another 'collection plunge' by expanding my Hero Clix that I will be buying, to not only the Marvel realm, but also the DC.  There are so many neat looking figures out there that I've just decided that I cant afford to have a few of them also!  Sides, it's sort of like any collection, got to find more more more!  Too bad, Nick  Greg from HW dont play regularly it would be fun to have new players to chat with  play with.  Ah, well off to bed, long day tomorrow Taco Johns and HW here I come 11-2 TJ  3:30pm- Close at HW...

      Coolness it's Friday night  Im home on my PC!!!  Rock on hardcore, Im such a villain!  Errrr... maybe not.  Well, anyways, Im comfy with my diet soda  the net to surf!  Nyah, nyah...  Ok, well, I was conversatin with one of the guys at HW, Kevin S.  it sounds like were definately on for Sunday night playing some Hero Clix.  He's been reading the rules  trying to figure it all out, should be a fun time.  Branden another guy from HW, might be interested in joining in at some point  trying the game out.  That would be fun too.  The more the merrier!  Sides, then I could teach them both at the same time  save my brain matter for more important things!  Like developing a cure for the common cold?!    At any rate, had a fun time playing Hero Clix with a few friends on Wed. night for a few hours.  Not only did we get to play but had some good conversation, sounds like we are all up for 'Return Of the King'  'Matrix Revolutions' get together!  So thats something to look forward to.  There were 4 of us playing, we ended up playing teams, 2v2 - 200 pt teams... needless to say, I promptly lost both games I played in!  Hehhe... Sorry to my two team mates, Eric  Tom!  I suck...  But it was still cool to play  use new characters, I'll get the 'handle' on how to use the new DC guys, sooner than later I hope.    Rented 'Identity'  'Man Apart' tonight  will try to get time to watch them both sometime on Saturday.  I've been neglecting watching any movies lately.  Just been too busy with either work or free time, Hero Clicking, which I like the most anyways!  I've been seeing some trailers on rentals  tv about a movie coming out called 'Underworld'  it looks like it might be a UBER Vampire, Werewolf, society, action movie!  Definately will have to find a friend or two to go see it!  Any takers out there?  Well, I'll let you know how I liked 'Identity' soon enough, from what I hear from everyone it should be great...  Im not a big Vin Diesel fan, so Im sure, it will be difficult for me to swallow, 'Man Apart' but, I'll try to do my very best.  I'm thinking about picking up some Batman comics  seeing where the Darkknight has been taken recently. I have a friend Tom, that is a crazy, Bat fan...  He was talking about a few issues that he has picked up.  Sounds really interesting.  I used to collect comics about 12-15 years ago...  Now, they are a different kind of art... not a lot of pages, more adds than ever.  So, I have to really consider it.  I look back at my old issues of titles like Daredevil, Avengers,  Uncanny X-Men  I look at the new versions  it's all 'greek' to me!  Geez, Im out of date, comics wise...  Maybe a fresh start with a new hero to collect like Batman, might be ok, seeing I'd be lost with a lot of the Marvel Universe anyways?    We'll talk again soon!  May The Force Be With You!  *Geeky Starwars reference*

      Hello!  I found out tonight that after I sent the 'link' out to this blog a few of my friends actually do drop by  read this thing.  Hopefully this will help you all find out when Im working or what Im up to!  Here is my schedule upcoming:  8/27/03 Wednesday :   OFF                          TJ's/OFF  HW 8/28/03 Thursday     :   OFF                          TJ's/9:00am - 6:00pm HW 8/29/03 Friday          :   11:00am - 2:00pm  TJ's/3:30pm - 12:30am HW 8/30/03 Saturday     :   OFF                          TJ's/OFF HW  As for something 'new' for me, bought myself a new DC Hero Clix figure at one of the Oshkosh gaming shops.  the game Hero Clix or follow comics.  But, he is a rare guy  used to be Batman's partner. Pretty cool figure, Night Wing - Veteran.  I know this does not mean a lot to those that do not play  Pretty excited to get him for only $5.00.  Ok, ok, no more Hero Clix talk!  Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers came out today on VHS/DVD  if you have not seen the movie, it's a must see!!  It rocks hard core,  it has the preview of the 3rd movie on the DVD which looks like it's going to rule.  Every, "big" movie event a few of my friends get together for premieres,  hopefully "Return Of The King" will be no different!  So, I will be asking off for the release date  would like to see my buds give me a yell (or email) to know if they are interested in going to wait in line  such for the event?  You all let me know, everyone welcome it makes it all the better.  Maybe could plan for a Matrix: Revolutions get together as well?  That would be good too!  My little blue bomber (car) is acting up  I dont think that she is long for the world.  It's been leaking oil out of the head gasket for months now  it's just getting worse  worse.  I checked the radiator fluid  it is green  black from oil...  Now, Im not a mechanical person by nature, but I dont think that is a good sign!  The temp light  check engine light has been coming on more and more frequently, so if you SEE me broke down on the highway, stop  give me a lift!!!    Have off today, kids coming at 1ish to stay till 6ish and see their old dad, will be fun like usual.  Kids be starting back to school  I'll not be able to see them for full days except for on Saturdays.  Bummer, Taco John's wants me to start working a few hours on Wednesdays when school starts back up, to help out.  So, there will go my Wed  Sat off without ANY work.  They were letting me have it off for the summer so I could spend full days with my children over the summer break, which was waaaay cool.   Ack, it shouldnt be too bad, could really use the extra 'day'  maybe Kat will let us find a way to get me another beater for the winter.  Soon, it will have to happen whether we plan for it or not...  Had a nice night working with Amber  Dave at HW.  Dave was telling ghost stories  freaking Amber out!  heheh, was cool.  Oh,  Kevin S. from HW has decided to purchase a few Marvel Hero Clix figures to maybe start playing the game with me!  That should rock!  It's always fun to have more peeps to game with.  He's already pulled a few unique figures from his starter  booster boxes!    Something totally COOL was something a friend of mine from Clintonville showed me at his hobby store was a fan made movie involving BATMAN!!  Tom another friend of mine were WOWED by the movie!  It's about 8min long and very well done!  Has Dark Knights nemesis The Joker  a few surprises, it's called Batman: Dead End.  It's well worth the download, the small version is 48meg  the Full Screen is 160meg.  Here is the link to it if you broad band users want to download it!   http://www.theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/batman_deadend/  Sorry I dont know how to 'link' it proper in a blog but you get the point!  Talk to all soon, good night!

      Coolness... Finally home after Rental Store Inventory at HW!  Was a decent inventory only posted approx. 23 items to lost over a 3 month period.  So thats pretty good, the usual that the store does.  Inventory went rather smoothly, the few bays that we missed the first time were easily identified  then fixed.  It's nice to do Inventory with fun people to conversate with.  Greg, one of the guys from HW that has worked there a long time is a real reliable guy when it comes to anything HW  is cool to visit with while working.  So it was all good!  Becky, Som  myself decided to go to Perkins afterwards for "breakfast" at 3:00am Hehhe...  What can we say?!   We were hungry!  Even though Becky took us for a "scenic" route through Oshkosh, we still arrived in good spirits.  Was good food  conversation, found out Som, really does know everyone in Oshkosh!!    Anyways, Im off to bed.  I had a brain fart  forgot I was suppose to go my Mom  Dad's house to help with the roof...  Ouchies,  I was out all day, so I did not get the message till far too late when I had to go to work.  Guess, I have to find a way to apologize for that, could not have been easy work without the extra set of hands.  SORRY!  I forgot, been busy working  it totally slipped my feeble mind.  Talk to everyone soon!

      Yowzers, Batman!!!  I'm back, Helllllo.  Anyways, went to J.D. Byryders on Wed. night  guess what?   After the applications, process I found out that I was approved for a car loan!  Only need $500.00 for a down payment.  $300.00 if I trade my lil blue car in.  So it's not all bad news, now I just have to save up for the payment.  Hopefully, I'll have the money soon.  Stay tuned, I just might be driving a different car!   Worked during the day today, with Becky, that was cool.  Both of us arrived sleepy  not looking too terribly excited.  Maybe Im just a little envious but it sounds like her being a college student  living in Oshkosh, will be a fun time!  Hehhe...  sometimes, I think of myself as so much older  BORING than most of the people that I work with  meet.  But, when I compare myself to her, I KNOW that I am, BORING heheh...  It's all good though, least I hear interesting stories.  Mrs. Welch came  brought ingredients for ham  turkey sandwiches!  So that broke up the day somewhat, so that was waaaay cool.  Nick, came in later in the day  I found out the 'details' that we are 'on' for Sunday night to play Hero Clix with some of the guys from work!  4 player Clix should be darn fun!  Play some 2v2  stuff!  Fun, fun...  Yeah, I know it's not an exciting story like some that I hear at work, but it's my excitement for the coming week.  After watching 'Identity' which I really enjoyed, I tried to watch 'Man Apart' with Vin Diesel... Just could not get into that movie at all...  But, tonight (Thurs) I rented 'The Core' it was ok... just a goofy sci-fi save the world adventure movie... think in the vein of 'Armageddon'  you've seen the movie.  Definately, not an overly serious movie.  Glad I waited to rent it  not go see it when it was in the theatre.  Dont get me wrong it's worth a rental look see just not worth the full theatre treatment, maybe.  Well, long day for me on Friday, work both jobs  then I have off Saturday... thankfully.  Should be 'fun' at HW.  Get to work with Nick, Becky  Amber.  Hopefully everyone will be cheery.   Oh  yeah if you see me in person.  I'm well aware that I have a few 'red marks' on my neck.  Feel free to pick on me if you'd like I dont mind...  I actually enjoy 'hickies' hehe... Night!  *May the Force Be with You*

      Hi, it's Monday night, Labor day weekend has flown past.  Did not seem like a 'holiday' to me at all.  Saturday, I could not pick up my children like Im supposed to.  Kat had some more problems with her back  I had to be available for her case we had to go back to hospital.  Ouch, If I even get a kink in my neck, Im miserable.  Cant imagine my back going out like it has for her.  Sorry honey.  Played Hero Clix with buddy of mine Saturday afternoon while Kat rested her back.  Shannon  myself got a game in before Tom called me back  we went over to his house for a little bit to play as well.  I've noticed something, 3 player Hero Clix is not that fun...  Someone always gets the 'poochin' heheh...  Anyways, wife started missing me, so she decided to drive my beater car over to look for me...  It overheated and broke down on her so she had to walk to Walmart to pick up her car... Omg, that must have hurt to walk a ways with your back hurting.  Anyways, we got the car home  now we are down to only one car for a bitty.  We'll have to see if we can get to a dealership soon to get a used car or something.  It was really cool on Sunday night to play Hero Clix with Kevin S.  Branden from HW after closing!  That rocked, I was surprised that Branden actually gave it a whirl!  He  Kevin both seemed to enjoy the game.  Although it did take a while to play the first time... With time, it gets a LOT easier... Trust me guys, if you read this... Anyways, Im always up for more playing if anyone is interested!  Talk soon, going to go play Everquest for a bit before bed...  YES, I said Everquest... For those that know me, I've been playing this game off  on for 3 years... heheh, my PC is too old to play the new game I'd like to play... Starwars Galaxies, so for now it's back to EQ... Sides, the new video card that I bought a month or 2 back, has really improved the performance!  Anyone want to play Everquest with me?  Im on the E'CI server!  Talk soon everyone  be happy.  *May the Hero Clix be with You*

      Been a few days since my last rant.  HERE I am!!  No worries!  Hehhe, anyways, nothing really new to say, on Saturday Kat  me took my kiddies to the movies to see 'Sinbad' the new Disney Animated movie.  They loved it!  It was a real fun time,  although I'm told that the movie did not make a lot of money, I thought it was very well done.  So, if you have the chance rent it when it comes out!  After the movie Kat  Casey went to Kat's sisters house to visit  make jelly with her mom.  That left Jordy  me to do boy stuff!  We played this StarWars board game that he really likes of mine.  StarWars Epic Duels... We played a few games of that which he really enjoys.  It's always fun to play.  Was a good day all around  I hope that they had fun with it all.  Today (Wed.) I have to work 10am-2pm at Taco John's then I get to pick the kids up from school in Kaukauna  spend a few hours with them.  Should be fun, I get to help them with whatever homework they might have  watch a lil t.v.  a movie.  So, Im really looking forward to that.   Been so busy with working that I have not had a lot of 'free' time to hang out with my buddies.  Which really sucks, any spare time that I might have is really late at night when Im done working.  That is not a real opportune time to hang out with people though!  Hhehe, sorry anyone that has been trying to reach me.  Sounds like Taco Johns will be having me working 4 days a week stead of the regular 3 that it had been.  Thats fine with me, with X-Mas coming up could really use the money.  Plus, my lil car is toasty  I have to make arrangements to a different one.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I have to get crackin  get my things in order so I can accomplish everything I need to get done in a day.  I rented the new Gweneth Paltrow movie, 'View From The Top' it was mostly a comedy about a flight attendant.... Woooopieeee doooo... Guess for any guys or gals that want to to see her, in skimpy out fits might get a thrill out of it, else wise it was a poor movie.  Well, on one final note that no one else will care about cept me, the new Everquest expansion came out today apparently.   "Lost Dungeons Of Norrath" its supposed to be like the traditional 'dungeon crawls' where monsters do not respawn after you kill them,  the treasures will be all new...  Also it's based around 1 party of 6 going into the dungeon and taking on the minions!  Should be way different than the way it was prior to this expansion where multiple groups were in the same dungeons killing monsters as they pop up!  I might have to talk Kat into letting me get it!  PLLLLLEEAAAASEEEE... honey =P  Ok, enough groveling...  *May the Clix Be With You*

      Heh!  I'm still here I assure you.  Just been tired  busy...  Rented 'Daddy Daycare' starring Eddie Murphy tonight.  Kat  I really enjoyed it.  It's one of those feel good movies filled with tons of cute moments.  It is rated 'PG'  a family title so it will see a lot of play time while I'm working!  Definately worth a look see when it becomes available for rent.  What are you waiting for??  Go rent it already!  Hmm, been craving some 'Hero Clix' lately.  Have not had the chance to play in over a week  a half.  Maybe Saturday morning while Kat is working I can sneak off to Oshkosh to play in a 'event' called "Oshcon".  It's scheduled to have all sorts of games displayed, just like a regular convention!  So it might be fun to see lots of other gamers  what they are playing!   http://www.oshcon.org/  Again, Im too lazy to 'link' it you'll just have to buck up  cut  paste to go check out the web page!    What else is new with me?  Nada!  Been playing heavy Everquest late at night when I'm able...  During work at HW I've been on Batman animated marathon!!  Watching lots  lots...  So that is cool.  Maybe when I've had enough Batman, I'll try out some old school "Dr. Who"  I noticed that we have several videos in the series at work...  NOW that might be some real torture for anyone that would stop in or work with me to view!  Heheh, I remember watching them on 'PBS' Public Broadcast Channel when I was in my early teens.  Cheesy british, adventure series about a time traveling, brilliant adventurer, called simply... "The Dr."  He time travels via a telephone booth heheheh... Was good stuff when I was a kid.  Carsaleswoman, left a message on the machine here saying that I still only need $300.00 for a downpayment to start the ball rolling at J.D. Byryder.  I just have to find the spare time literally when it is light out to go look at the cars and see if there is anything on the lot that I am willing to make payments on... I get the impression that I would have a limited selection of the cars...  Im aware that I might not have a lot of money or credit rating, but they also have to realize that I have to be WILLING to make the payments.  If it's a car they are just trying to be rid of... they can keep them.  Well, Im off to bed, have to work early...  9/19 : Friday  :  TJ's 9:00am-2:00pm /HW 3:30pm - Close 9/20 : Saturday: TJ's  OFF                / HW  OFF 9/21 : Sunday:  TJ's  OFF                  / HW 3:30pm - Close  See you there... or at home if you want to speak at me!  *Woooo hoooo*

      Hi!  Went to see 'Once Upon a Time In Mexico' on the Ultra screen in Appleton last night!  Kat  I had a good time, was worth seeing, if you liked 'Desperado' more of the same campy gun fights and humor...  I enjoyed it.  Nothing new here, been playing a lot of Everquest late at night  working during the days.  Weekends for me are actually a time of rest for me, so thats a good thing.  Still no different car, have not had any real time to search for one either.  I'll get to work on it hardcore this coming week, it's drains both the wife  I to only have one car.  Kat  I are planning on going to see 'Underworld' next Saturday night so that should be a good night!  Fun fun!  Vampire werewolf movie!

      Woah!!!  News today actually...  Gots me a NEW car,  I dont mean USED!!!  Brand new 2003 Kia Rio, she is a silver 4 door!  Rockin!!!  So if you see me cruisin, I'll finally be riding in something 'cool'.  After being car less for a few weeks, I learned a hard lesson... "It is nice to have transportation"  Hopefully, I'll not soon forget it.  The Kia is the very first new car I have ever owned in my entire life.  I have never been the sort that have needed a fancy ride, but I can tell you it does make me feel a bit better to know that I 'should' make it to my destinations relatively 'safe' in knowing that I should not break down.  *knock on wood*  Over the years I have owned all sorts of hand me down cars,  every once in a while a cooler sporty car... But, another thing I learned is that ALL vehicles no matter how pretty they are on the outside, they all break!  Hehhe...  Maybe it's my driving?!?  Learned a lot about car upkeep from Eggy my dad too...  Sometimes the hard way,  sometimes the HARDER way!  exp... when I ran my lil cars out of oil  decided to continue driving till my engine seized up!  DOH...  So, as you all see me soon.  I'll have to show you my new car!  Im really proud of it  although she does not have all the bells  whistles it's a nice vehicle!  So let me brag a bit...   Talk to you all soon!

      Maybe you'll not notice, but I'll tell you anyways... It's Tuesday morning  it's in th AM,  Im awake at 6:30a.m. now that sucks!!  Anyhow, this past Saturday Kat  myself went to HW Cinema  watched 'Underworld' on the Ultra Screen!!  If your into Horror/Sci-Fi then you will more than likely enjoy the Vampire/Werwolf action movie...  I sure did!  Yes, it did remind me of the 'White Wolf' RPG 'Vampire The Masquerade' but thats not a bad thing... Not at all.  It just sort of 'lent' that background  setting.  The action was intense  the politics  plot  subplots was well put together.  Overall, I walked out pleased.  Go see it!  Well, tonight after work at HW, will be stopping over at one of the guys house to play some 'Hero Clix'!  Should be a fun time, we decided to play some 1v1 games.  Easier to understand what is going on  less confusing for new players.  Plus it helps them  me to develop new strategies.  Bought myself a few single Hero Clix at House of Heroes in Oshkosh yesterday!  Veteran Dove, Experienced Hawk both from the DC set...  a really cool piece that I've been looking to pick up for a while... Veteran Wolverine!!  He just rocks!  Why??  Cuz... He's the best there is at what he does  whats he does is not very nice!!  So, I'll have to find a way to fit Wolvie into my X-Man team tonight at least once to see how I do.  Guess we are playing at least 2 games...  So should be a good time.  Wish me luck, I'll need it!  Sometimes, the dice, just dont like me.  =(    Kevin from work also borrowed me the movie '28 days later' he downloaded off the net...  It's the horror thriller with the plague of zombies that is wiping out the world or something to that effect.  I'll let you know what I thought of it after I view it.  Oh,  one more thing for those peeps that rent movies are running low on 'new' movies to rent... Take a look at 'Pool Hall Junkies' it's a pool movie of course as the name might suggest, but me not being interested in pool all that much I still really enjoyed it.  A LOT in fact...  I've been recommending to everyone that is struggling to find a movie, so give it a look see!  We'll talk again soon!    *May The Force Be With You*

      Hi!  Just a quick post to let you all know that I really enjoy the new car!  It's fun, runs good  even looks nice.  I do get teased about it being a 4door... But, thats ok at least everything is working really well with it.  Been working lots, Sorry to any of my friends that I have not been able to hang out with lately.  If your not a 'night owl' it will be tough for us to hang out often...  But, you could always give me a holler at home or better yet, HW in Oshkosh if you want to get together!  Give a yell!  The boys at HW seem to really enjoy Hero Clix,  I like playing with them!  One of the guys, Schaefer, I give a hard time because he so serious.  So I give him crap  talk extra smack to him to rile him up!  We all played a 2v2 game 200pts on Tuesday night  Branden  Schaefer beat, Nick  me... BOOOOOO... heheh, nah it was ok tried our best they just rocked us!  We'll get em next time.  Work tomorrow 9am-6pm at HW that should be ok, least the new movies arrive, so I can take one of those home to view...  Oh, I watched '2 Fast 2 Furious' the new movie  although I did not like the first one... I did not mind the new one.  Not sure what the difference was, maybe it was just the cars  the action that hooked me this time around.  If you liked the first one you should enjoy the 2nd.  Well, have to run.  Taking the kids to the park for a bit before their mom comes to pick them up.  I'll let you know how sore I was after all the running around next time!!   Hehhe... I dont get to play basketball like I used to, have to find some peeps that are interested in the hoop a thon... so I can hoop it up again more often!  Talk to you alll laters.

Geeez, I actually sleep when Im not working or catching a quick movie with Kat.  I'll talk to you all later!  Oh  by the way, 'Matrix: Reloaded' comes out next tuesday!

      Well, had a nice Saturday all I did was rest all day.  Watched two movies that will be coming out on Tuesday.  'The Italian Job'  'Hollywood Homicide' only one of them was worth watching... I could let you guess which one I liked at which was the stinker, but I think you can prolly guess by the box office grosses over the summer!  I really enjoyed 'Italian Job' Im usually game for a 'caper' movie  this one did not disapoint... well rounded cast with a few new faces!  You just have to love a movie that uses 'minis'  you actually feel like its a speedy chase!    'Hollywood Homicide' on the other hand has to be one of Harrison Fords worst movies...  Josh Hartnet, dont think could even draw enough female fans to save it.  Just a poor cop buddy movie that never really goes anywhere.  I guess the biggest gimmick in this movie is that both Ford  Hartnet are moon lighting at different jobs to make ends meet... Ford as a real estate agent  Hartnet as a yoga instructor??  Go figure it was a poor movie... Save yourself the rental.  Well, I missed hanging out with one of my good friends Jim on Friday.  Just could not get a hold of him.  Maybe we'll have to hang out next Friday night after work or something...  Need to do some gaming.  Have not had the chance to play any of the new console games...  for anyone that is not in the 'know' Jim is  the gaming connection!  He has all of the current consoles  a lot of the old school gaming consoles...  It rocks hard core! I get to experience a lot of games.  He's also the one that helped get me started in PC games.  So, I'll have to take a look  see what new he has for that as well... So Jim if you read this... Give me a holler!  On Friday instead seeing I could not get a hold of Jim, I ended up going over to another friend of mines house... Tom.  We played two games of Hero Clix... It was cool... I actually was 'allowed' to play DC Clix... heheh... I won the first game  he won the second so we were both happy.  Hopefully one of these weekends Tom will be able to come down to play with the guys from HW that I play Clix with!  Be  a fun time, those guys would be amazed at how many figures he has in his collection!    Well, time to get ready for work, hopefully everyone will be cheery so the night will go smoothly.  Here's to hoping!   Talk to all soon!  BTW, I made level 47 With my Shadowknight on Everquest over the weekend!   Yeah, Im a geek... But it's cheaper  safer than hanging out at the bars!  *May The Force Be With You*

      Yo!  It's time for another update.    My friend Shannon stopped in today at HW.  That was way cool.  It's always good to have my usually boring night broken up with a good visit.  Although he did pick on me about my blog!  Apparently, he had some questions about what I write about.  So, I had  to enlighten him  explain some things... Like why do I end a lot of my posts with *May The Force Be With You*  Hmmm... Good question, my way of saying 'good-bye' on this ol' blogger thing I guess  to remind everyone that I really enjoy Starwars!  He hassled me good about a few things,  it made me wonder if I'm really all that boring?!  Yeah, I am...  He  Nick from HW say I talk about the same old things... yeah, but I told them if they dont like the topics they could always write their own blogs or stop reading!  Kat, had some good news today.  At Wal-Mart she is going to be starting a new shift in the deli, overnights.  Seems like she has really been wanting to get away from her co-workers during the day maybe or customers?  Seems like she was excited when she called me at work to fill me in on the details.  She'll also be getting a shift differential pay increase so that is always a good thing.  Hopefully she will enjoy working the new shift  new responsibilities.  It's always better when you can actually tolerate what you are being paid to do for a living!  With what I said above the wife has cleared me to hang out later at night seeing she'll likely not be home except on weekends at night.  So, I'll be able to play clix with the boys at HW if they want or watch movies or TV late at night starting Nov. 1.  Oh well, it will be definately different, I'm so used to having her here with me.  Maybe I'll get lonely at night?  Hmmm, what else is on my mind before I turn in for the night?  Still playing Everquest... Thats normal... still playing Hero Clix when I have the chance... thats normal... still going to see 'Matrix: Revolutions' opening night... thats normal... hmmmm... I'm still 'normal' a GEEK!  My daughters birthday is coming up on the 24th of this month!  So she is already getting excited to see what Kat  I dream up for a present for her... I'm not so in 'tune' with what she likes  dislikes, but Kat seems to know so that is good!  The manager of TJ's was talking about a place called 'Air it Up' in Appleton that has a enormous obstacle course that kids  adults can run around in... (think Americas Gladiators) big cushy environment with rope ladders  such to interact with.  So maybe this winter will have to make a stop in there with the kids!  The new car is working out GREAT!  So it was a pretty good decision to go for the new car route...  I'm trying my best to keep it in nice condition...  Talk again soon!

      Hi again!  Sunday coming up  I stayed up late!  Hhehe... playing  surfing on the old PC here.  Had the kids today all day (Sat.)  Celebrated my son's birthday!!  He turns 9 on the 12th, which is Sunday =P  Boy is he getting big!  Both my Son  daughter turn a year older this month!!  Still sassy  still know what they want when they want it.  Heheh...  So it was a good weekend for me.  I really enjoyed spending some good time with them.  We watched 'Daddy Daycare'  went to the park for a while!  Ran around playing tag.  I'm getting slower while they keep getting faster  faster!    Generally, although I've more tired than usual lately.  I have nothing 'bad' to say about anything.  Kat  I have been getting along fine.  So that is always a good thing.  Been able to spend a little free time with friends doing various things...  So, I've been happy for the last 2 weeks I guess!  You all have a great day!  Errrr... night... or morning...

      Hey!  Something new to me!  I decided to finally pick up a comic book mini series... Now, I have not collected a book in over 15 years  I used to be 'big' into collecting Marvel...  The new comics just did not appeal to me.  A lot of the new art just looks slapped together to me.  Oh well... I decided to pick up the limited edition series DC/Marvel cross over, it's 4 issues!!!  JLA vs Avengers!!!  Let me just say I was pleasantly pleased!!!  Woah!!!  Rocks hard core, reminds me of the old Marvel 'Secret Wars' story line...   I will not spoil any of it, but it was very well drawn  written!  Check it out if your remotely interested in comics.

      Hello!  Glad the comments are working.  I see a few of you decided to utilize it... Coolness.  My friend Tom, has started the process of setting up 'Matrix:Revolutions' night at the Ultra Screen here in Appleton...  Him, Eric,  Nick B. are all going opening night.  Most of my other friends work or have not shown interest in getting together for it.  Maybe my friend Jim S. would be interested... He's a Matrix type guy.  Jim if you read this let me know?  Would be cool to see the midnight showing with you as well.  I have to get up the next morning  open at HW...  But, Im game for the Matrix baby!!!  I have to close Friday at HW  then Im off on Saturday.  Bereneth... Im definately up for Friday night Clix late at night when the Kat switches to overnights.  I'll talk to the guys at HW  see if they want to switch our Clix night to that evening if your available?  Maybe Tom, could make it too or something?!  Could have 6 player game, now that would rock!  Also... a friend of mine Eric S. stopped in to HW the other day to rent some movies with his girlfriend, he said he was still interested in getting together to play Clix as well!  So... that is cool as well.  So Eric, if you read this get a hold of Tom or me or something  maybe we can set some time to play!  Im a Hero Clix junky!  Other news it  is my daughters B-Day on the 24th of this month!  Happy day!!!  She turns 8!!!  She's a little stinker just like her dad!  Casey is her name in case any of you's did not know  she's a lil turkey most of the time!  My son Jordan he turned 9 on the 12th but I mentioned that previously...  I've been told he is the spittin image of me.  With all kidding aside, I think it's the greatest thing in the world to have kids  to spend what little of my life I can with them.  If you have kids, you understand... If you dont... you wont untill you do.  There are places in peoples hearts that just do not 'open' up without the addition of flesh in blood to your life... Does that make sense?  I hope to work enough hours in the upcoming months to provide an ok X-Mas for them!  Im playing Clix tomorrow night with the boys from HW, guess it's going to be a 200pt teams game.  Should be fun, 2v2 is always good.  Hope the game does not drag too long, I have to work the next morning at TJ's.  Want to try some of my news figs that I got from an internet website...  Talk to everyone soon!    *May The Force Be With You*

      Hullo!  Well, weekend is gone  Monday came  went...  Went to see 'S.W.A.T.' on Saturday night with Kat at the budget in Appleton.  We both ended up liking it!  Was good all around action shoot em up movie...  Plus Samuel Jackson, gets to deliver, the "look" a few times...  He's one bad mofo, rent it when it comes out, I hope you'll not be disapointed.  Played Hero Clix with Shannon one of my friends, on Friday night after work!  That rocked, I dont get to see him all that much anymore, he has a wife  baby girl to provide for now so our schedules do not mesh that well.  It's always good to hang out  shoot the b.s. with him.  I'm the one to blame for getting him into collecting Hero Clix so I can be man enough to go over there and get whipped by him!  We played 2 - 200pt games, he played DC both times  I played Marvel.  1st game came down to him only have one guy left  me toasty... was a close fun game.  2nd game was pretty much a whippin...  Him wompin me that is.  Good games all around and when I play him I dont feel any pressure to 'win' or whatever it's just a good time.  We are all going to try to get together Saturday at Greg's house to play some games... So hopefully that will go through without a hitch!  Should be fun, maybe have 4 or 5 guys or something like that to play with.   Have to refresh  teach Greg how to play again, but thats cool... It's really awesome to have another player in the 'group'... Oh  lest I forget Cronk from work has started picking up Marvel Clix!  So, again another player to teach and add to the group!   He already pulled a Unique Thanos!!  Rock on man!  Ok, enough Clix... On Nov 5th Tom, Eric,  Nick B. are all going to the evening showing of 'Matrix:Revolutions' so that should be cool as heck!  Im taking that day off from TJ's so I can hang out during the day with them if they have the time... maybe watch the other 2 movies and shoot the breeze?!    Jim another one of my friends stopped in to HW to say 'Hi' and get a few movies... Was waaaaay... coool... Jim makes me laugh everytime I see him, we usually slip into a routine of picking on someone... ANYONE!  Have to hang out with him real soon!  He said he would be interested in Matrix on the 5th have to push him to get his ticket so we can all see it together in a group.  K, Im out of here you all stay out of trouble  if you dont play Hero Clix yet... SHAME on YOU...

      Wow, Matrix: Revolutions...  I'll start by saying this, I've read lots of 'professional' reviews  some just by fans of the Matrix trilogy after viewing the movie... I did not want to know any potential spoilers before going.  I'll say this about all these comments that are negative to the film.  I truly think that when plot items in a movie do not go the way the viewer had wanted or envisioned there is a lash out in one way or another.  It's true, I've done it myself when reading a book or watching a favorite television show  yes, even when I view a movie.   With that said I'll say this, I am by no means a 'hard core' Matrix fan... I own the movies  enjoyed all 3 of them...   Did things go as I thought?  Prolly not... Was I surprised?  Yes...  Was I invested in the characters of the Matrix more than I thought I was?  Yes...   Matrix Revolutions was a great sci fi movie that has tons of angles  plot points.  Which can be confusing  seem like it might not have a true direction at times... But dont all movies?  It's entertainment!  With that in mind the 3rd film delivers!  It's dark  brooding throughout...  What did anyone expect?  It's about the culmination of WAR!  The action rocked hardcore... The effects were dazzlin...  The sound track I dont really recall anything to write home to about, maybe after seeing it a 2nd and 3rd time I'll recall more about the track...  The sound effects were of course spot on...   So, it's the end of the trilogy  I for one am glad that I took the 'red pill'  have been along for the ride!   I appreciate everyone that took part in bringing the Sci fi actioner to the silver screen!!   Boo Yah....  I'm there if there ever is another sequel or moves to another medium!

      Well, it's nearly here!!!  Matrix: Revolutions!!!  Yeah, baby, it's going to rock!  Later I'll be sitting at the Hollywood Cinemas Ultra Screen watching it with a bunch of friends.  I've been looking to this for a LOOOONG time!  I'll let you all know how it is...  Well, on Sat. I played Clix with some guys from HW at Greg's house.  It was a real fun time.  Greg is still learning the game  it sounded like from talking to him that he learned a bit  had fun as well.  So thats good.  There has been talk from the guys that there is a tournament on this coming Sunday, Marvel only 200pt... Maybe some of them will go or to watch.  Few of them asked if I was going... ack, maybe not I'm really clicked out lately  would rather sleep probably.  Will I be gung ho again, when the new expansion comes out  attend the Marquee tourney for the exp???  YES!!!  Upcoming inventory at HW on Nov 22... So I have that to look forward to...  NOT!  Hate working overnight like that, it's pretty boring.  Only thing that makes it remotely intersting is visiting with Greg  some of the other guys.  This time around we'll have Clix to visit about so thats cool.  There is quite frankly nothing else new with me.  I'll be requesting to only work 3 days a week at TJ's maximum.  I'm just getting too burned out with everything lately.  I need some time to just veg out or do what I want.  It would be nice to go visit my Mom  Bruce a few times... It's pretty rude of me to only be able to visit on holidays or special ocassions...  SO... I need to get it together  do some visiting...   Ok, Im off to surf the web before sleep.  Let me know if anything is new with all of you by using the comments or giving me a call...    *May The Force Be With You*

      Nice weekend has come  gone.  This past Saturday, Kat  I took the kids to their grandparents home in the big city of Morgan Siding.  Jordan  Casey were both excited to be able to go, so that was a good sign of what was to come.   We stopped at 'Hardees' to eat before making the drive  although the new burgers are good they are not worth the extra costs...  Still it was good eats.  Well, my mom  dad were excited to see the kids  we all had a nice visit.  I ended up taking the kids for a walk to see a old field that I used to play in as a kid.  That was fun, back when I was smaller it seemed like such a big adventure to walk this huge farmers field.  The big mystery of the field is that there are ghost stories associated it with it  big almost crater like hole that is like HUGE!  My mom calls it the 'kitty hole' so I walked my kids out to see it.  I think they were impressed.  Made tentative plans to celebrate Thanksgiving with my mom  dad.  Not sure which day we will feast, but it should be fun.  I'm off from HW on Wed.  boy am I looking forward to it.  Been so tired that I dont feel that Im doing my 'best' work anymore at either job.  It's tough lately.  Kat's Monte Carlo took a dump on her, so her sisters boyfriend borrowed her a winter car to get to and from work.  So thats good  bad.  Hopefully with tax money in a few months we can afford to get that car either fixed or a decent vehicle for Kat to drive around.  Kat wants to go see 'Matrix: Revolutions' soon, so thats cool I'll get to go see it again!  Well, nothing else new.

      I,  urlLink Branden , will be your host for today, so sit back, and enjoy.  Buttlore wanted me to log into his blogger and update with a post for him.  He ordered a new computer that will be arriving in a week or two, and he won't have internet until then.  He still won't have broadband internet though, so he sucks.  Untill E can return, and enthrall you all with his own words, you will have to find  urlLink something  else to waste your time on.  Zebby out.

      Hi, everyone!  Welcome back to your favorite Bat Channel!  Boooo Ya!!!  Anyways, as some of you are aware I received my new PC and now have been playing Starwars Galaxies in any free time that I have!  It's a sweet game, and Im still no good at it.  Critical Mass the new Hero Clix expansion came out a few days ago...  It looks like it's going to rock!  I so far only have 4 figures... Spiderman - R, Corsair - E, Magick - E, Kree Warrior - V... WOooooo... Not!  Anyways, I'll post the specs for my new PC later on, my new email address if you want to get a hold of me via email is now:  mutlore23@aol.com  Yes, AOL sucks but I got 6 months free with the new PC so instead of paying MSN during that time I might as well get a small break on internet costs!  Talk again soon!

Games that are solo or do not require online zooooom...  Talk again soon...   Feel free to tell me what PC games are up and coming and which I should be playing now during the breaks from SW...  *May The Force Be With You*

      Hi there.  Well, bad news again for our family.  My mother called me this morning  gave me the news that my Uncle Harry has passed away.  He had been struggling with cancer for a long time now.  What a year.  I cant begin to imagine the effect that this is having on my mom  her siblings... Cant even begin...   Although I was not close to my Uncle I remember in my younger years, what he was like.  He was a nice man everytime I seen him.  My mom told me that she felt like it was a blessing that he passed on, apparently the pain and suffering were very great.  My Aunt Mary passed away earlier this year from cancer as well.  So it has been a sad end to 2003.  This all brings into light our own mortality... It REALLY brings into light that my own mom  dad are not getting any younger...  Sickness can take any of us anytime...  I can only hope to be able to show the ones that I love that... I am here  am only a call or email away from a visit or get together.   So if any family/friends would like to visit, you give me a holler...  We make some time to 'catch up'  You all be safe out there...  To my Uncle Harry... I never had the chance to know you as I grew older, but I never forgot you.   May it all be better where you are now.  Peace

      Hi!   Happy Holidays to you  yours!  Kat had a visitor this week!  Her daughter Sammy Jo came to visit her mom for the holidays.  So the two ladies I suppose did what girls do?!  Hopefully it was a great time for them both, Sammy lives in Nebraska.  So Kat does not get to spend a lot of time with her daughter.  Although that did mean that I myself did not get to see Mrs. Welch a lot this week... But that's ok, I spent extra time with my computer.  I've never been a big holiday person, but this year I see that with me working Both Xmas Eve  Xmas day, that I could maybe start a little?  To my family if you read this, maybe we can change this for future years  spend it as a group.  I have two little ones that dont get to see their Uncle  Aunt Renee often if at all,  rarely get to see their Grandpa  Grandma... maybe it's time that I see that it's important to do it for the kids.  So, let me try and fix that for future, years.  Nothing new to post, other than New Years is approaching and I work both the Eve and day again.  Maybe I should change that too and actually go and have some fun before 2004?!  *May The Force Be With You*

      Hey there!  Hi, HAPPY BIRTHDAY goes out to my mother!  January 5th!  Happy B-Day Mom!  I did not forget!  Well, on Saturday, kids  me paid a visit to Dad  Mom's home!  Was a good time.  Kids made us laugh, specially Jordan... funny little guy.  My parents still have an old Atari 2600 system that my brother  I used to play all the time when we were small... My son the video game player, he was made me laugh... heh.  Atari is definately not too advanced anymore.  But, he still wanted to take it home.  Maybe next visit I'll let him take it home.  It was and still is a blast to play those old games.  He loved em!  Maybe I'll get him one of those new joysticks that Target's and Wal-Mart sells that have like 20 of the old games on it.  Make it easier and more portable for him to play it than those old cartridges.  Picked up and old monitor that my dad had extra, so that I can get my son's computer put together for him.  My old one, just a 450 mhz but he play some old games and get some pc experience on it.  He seems to like that games that it can run,  I remember my first computer, make the little guy feel important.  Well, nothing else... You all be safe.  *May The Force Be With You*

      Hi everyone!  Time for the update, took the kids to my mom  dad's house this Saturday!  They had a lot of fun.  Kat made her noodle dish that everyone likes so much  we feasted and feasted.  So that was great.  My mom gave Jordy the old Atari 2600 system that she had, he was happy as a beaver.  Games are games and they never seem to get old those classic games.  They are still just as fun...  Were going back up to visit in 2 weeks again, so that will be fun again, hopefully we'll be able to visit longer... Maybe bring up a few movies to watch or something.  Well, big news to some, I quit SW Galaxies...  I know, I know I raved and raved about the game when I first started playing it.  Truthful I did not know enough about it, so I had not seen enough..  Now with 3months playing experience I think I can speak from a different point of view and say although it is beatiful graphically... The game is lacking, content for those players that 'Master' any profession... It's not a game based on Levels or character classes necessarily but on skills and skill trees... Everyone in the game has the same amount of points to spend on skills to pick up and once you have spent them all you have to un learn skills to try to new things or just stay put... Sort of sucky.   So once you build your character, you are really at and end when it comes to building.   Sure you can try new skills or whatever, but to 'Master' a Class in SW depending on what it is, (the good ones take up nearly all points) you might be able to dabble in a small skill on the side.   So it lacks content!   Maybe with the expansions that they have planned, like the space one, I might give the game another try, but untill then I'm back to Everquest!!!  What else is new?  Nada...  Filing of taxes is coming soon and hopefully with that we can pay off some bills, and be done with it.  My new PC, I would like to get that paid off as quick as possible the finance charges through Dell are taking a toll... GEEEEE...   Ok, you all take care  May the Force Be with you!

      Hello.  Well, you'll hear it here, if you read this thing, else if you see me in person I might tell you there instead.  It's over...  Kat has left me, moved her things out.  Nothing more to say to that other than I deserved it.

      Hi there!  Well, time for an update... Over the weekend, Saturday to be exact I went to the movies here in Appleton with my brother, his wife  my wife Kat.  Yeah, you read it right, my wife =:P  Went to see 'Butterfly Effect' With Ashton Kutcher in it.  I'll not write a review, but lets just leave it at this it's really a Sci-Fi/Psychology movie... Is the best that I could describe it shortly.  It will surely not appeal to everyone, because it does not move fast, nor does it have a lot of action that is real popular these days.  My opinion?  Average at best, I could have stood to see a different title.  Worked at HW tonight with KP... That was a refreshing change!  I was really surprised at how well we got a long.   It was really fun for a change at work, we got all our things done  such,  then visited about PC's, Games, movies,  puzzles and riddles!  Im not much a riddle man, myself... But, he got me into the groove of it near the end...  Just think... Albotross... Albotross...  We'll definately have to work together again sometime soon KP!  This next note goes out to Shannon, one of my friends so the rest that might read can ignore...  We have planned and confirmed through Tom that we are playing this WED. 6:30pm at Lukie's house... If you going to come let me know... Playing AD 2nd Edition Rules... Im dungeon mastering.  Well, to end this post, you never know what to expect from people... ANY people and sometimes they can pleasantly surprise you.   Wife  I still have our troubles and are still apart.  But, I sure did not get married a second time to just give up when the going gets rougher...  Maybe the time apart is permanent?   I'm not sure, but it cant be a bad thing if it sets us both in the right direction?!  I really appreciate everyone's support that knows about our current situation... THANKS!  It does get lonely here in this apartment at times now,  Im no grand house keeper!     Cya all laters...  *May The Force Be With You*

      Hey there!  Welcome back...  I sort of missed you?!  Anyways, couple of days ago I signed up for the  'World Of Warcraft'  BETA... It's another massively multiplayer game that is coming out later this year (hopefully).  You might know the company if your a PC gamer...  Blizzard Entertainment !  Makers of such fine games as  'Warcraft 1 -   3'   'Diablo 1 - 2'  'StarCraft'   all big sellers and high quality products that have over the years given me lots  lots of replay value!!  Yes, those games mentioned above have even helped end some past relationships of mine!   Hopefully the new game will be cool... If not I still have  Everquest 2  to look forward to.  As for anything else?  Went to my mom  dad's this past weekend...  I really let the kids take the lime light, they like to visit their grandma and grandpa!  So that was great for them.  Kat  I my parents I guess talked about our situation...  I chose not to participate in that particular discussion.  I'm really just not in the mood for that sort of talk.  I feel a lot of pressure from her (Kat) to reconcile and work things out..  I just dont really know where my heart is anymore.  There was a time when I would have plugged away blindly till the bitter end  let my feelings be smashed to bits... maybe I can see that coming?!   It's happened over and over, the leaving... the fighting... the more leaving... the more fighting...   I never want to get to the point of being violent...  at times it's so tough, when someone knows enough about you to fight 'dirty'.... Is it time to call it quits or give it one more whirl??  Enough of that, it's boring to talk about, sides I have no answers.   I'm just looking to have a bit of fun with the time that is free to me.  Have to get off my booty and make an appointment to get my taxes done... Maybe a boost in the pocket book will cheer me up and give me some needed direction... Also, the car needs to have the oil changed and tires rotated... Fun, fun... for everyone!  A few days ago, I downloaded a behind the scenes clip from a website, concerning  StarWars Episode 3 ...  I dont know if any of you all have seen it... but it's done with AC/DC  'Back In Black' playing in the background... It's pretty cool, you get to see Obi-Wan  Anakin dueling in front of green screens!!   Leaping all over the place... Chewie... doing his thing...  Mace, getting his twirl on...  If your any kind of Starwars fan you have to look for it...  I dont remember the link that I downloaded it from, but if you do a search you should find it.  Greg, one of the guys from HW would have a blast with it I think!  He's a BIGGGER Starwars geek than I ever could be... Trivia  collectables are his b</post></Blog>
