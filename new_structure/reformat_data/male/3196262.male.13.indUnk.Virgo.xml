      Hey. Just got back from Anitas party. What a day. School sucked. When i got home, i went out on my bike and rode w/ Max. We went all the way to Lowes Theather (spelt wrong.) We had to go across this huge bridge and he was scared of heights. Once we got there, we went under the bridge and through all these woodsy areas. Then, we went down this huge hill, came back up it and almost got ran over. After, we went to the HP park and then rode home. I then went to Village  Pizza and went to Antas. What a day. It kinda sucked in ways but yeah. Ok. c ya.

      Modding is the art of voiding your warranty.  So far max and i have been doing a little modding. Visit  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  to see. You can also mod your xbox. I soon will be doing this. When modding your xbox you could play DVDs w/o the DVD remote and you could play music and copied games. You could also back up games to the hard drive and you could replace the hard drive with a 12o GB hard drive. There is many ways to do this. If you screw up Microsoft(c) will not replace your xbox. So you really need to know what you are doing. To learn more go  urlLink here.   Later.
