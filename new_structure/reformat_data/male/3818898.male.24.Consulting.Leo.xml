      Something is funny about how things are going for me recently. I havenât been able to open my eyes to many things. I preferred to stay oblivious to the happenings of my life. The majority of these things deal with Kelly. I still havenât acted as I should have when it comes to her. Reasons for this vary, but the prevailing one is that I just was blinded by love. Love that deep can be misleading at times.  I told Kelly on many occasions that I just wanted to be there for her. Her response to me was that she told me, on these occasions, that she would call me when she needed to talk to me. So I tried to do that for her. I gave her the space she wanted, and allowed myself to play second-fiddle to her life. But when I needed her most, she was not there for me. This last full semester, I felt overwhelmed with pressure from school, work, parents, death of a friend, Kelly, etcâ¦ I was full of questions, doubt and fear about what direction my life would go; if I would be successful or not, if I could make it through these tough times and emerge stronger than I was previous to this. My life had become a whirlwind. Those two weeks before she left me, I was really struggling. That was when I was reaching the breaking point. Kelly decided that would be the opportune time to drop the bomb on me. I crashed hard. I hit a very low point. I didnât even get to enjoy my own college graduation. But I couldnât turn to my best friend. She wanted nothing to do with me and treated me like a piece of shit. This took me to a place beyond a low. I became someone else. I couldnât handle it. It was just too much in too little of time. And she wasnât there for me. She would rather party, drink, smoke, and sleep with other people than be there for someone she shared three years of her life with, shared her hopes and dreams with, someone who supported her every decision, up-lifted her on any occasion, stood by her and held her hand when she needed it, trusted her to be loyal, and someone who loved her unconditionally. How selfish was that? It still hurts to this day. In her weakest moments, she seemed to show some remorse. But I think that was just a blip in time because after I comforted her and told her how good of a person she was, how desirable she was to me, how much I loved her, and how beautiful she is, she stopped calling me and continued back down the road she was on before she stumbled. I was used.  When she started to contact me again, she sounded like she wanted to reignite things again. But I was wrong. Who knows what is going through her mind? I canât read her anymore. I donât know when she is telling me the truth, or just trying to spare my feelings anymore. But I did realize one thing (I believe); the reason why she called me was that she only wanted to use me at her own convenience for her own pleasure and self-confidence and not because she actually wanted to be around me. She merely didnât want to feel alone. She wants to feel desirable; like she has something available to her at any time she wants. Itâs a sense of security she needs on a short-term basis and I am something familiar that will solve that temporary problem for her. If she needed someone, why didnât she turn to those people she likes to think are her friends or the guy she ran to when she was done with me? She has admitted to me that she has made a practice of keeping me around (i.e. keeping me from dating) so she has the option of returning to something safe if all else fails. How do you think that makes me feel? I feel like I am worth no more than the toilet paper sitting in my bathroom. She has the impression that I am going to be waiting here at her beck-and-call. But I canât be used as her safety net any longer. She will just continue to take advantage of my kindness and generosity. I truly love her and care for me more than any other person out there, but that does not give her the right to abuse my feelings like she has. I have a ton of love to give, but I need to feel loved also. No man is an island and I desperately want to be happy. I want to share my life with someone who is willing to rejoice in my successes, cry in my failures, support me when I need it, stand by my side, love me like I love her, and trust me to do the right thing for the benefit of us both. What more could a person want?  Some things just donât hit you until days after the fact. To notice some trends, they need to happen for a few days before you can start to see the pattern. I donât think she realizes that she hasnât called me since she decided not to sleep with me anymore. The only times we talked and hung out was because I initiated contact. Is that the only reason why she called me in the first place? I have yet to receive one phone call from her and she hasnât even asked to see me since this all went down. I am now going to put this to a test. I am going to not call her and see how long it takes until she folds and gives me a call. I am really curious to see if she will even call me at all. Iâm sure she will eventually, but who knows how long that will take. It most likely will happen when she either feels like I am walking away or when she gets lonely again. The ironic part is that I will probably be dating someone else when that happens. Thatâs the way things unfolded last time. She mentions that possibility so much that I wonder if she really wants that for me so she doesnât have any remorse about treating me the way she has. In fact, sometimes I think she really despises speaking with me, but hangs out with me to merely humor me. Why do I need thoughts like this? All it does is make me question my self-worth. I donât like thinking that I am that worthless. I know it is not true. I am a diamond in the rough. But still my confidence suffers because of her.  This entire situation reminds me of something I have watched a good friend of mine do many times before. What has been done to me is precisely what Brandon does to many of the girls he comes across.
