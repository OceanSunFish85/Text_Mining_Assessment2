      So said Alan Rickman, in âSense and Sensibilityâ using a voice at once quiet yet booming. If I could change one physical attribute about myself, it would be my voiceâ¦ and I might be tempted to steal Alan Rickmanâs.  Yesterday, I was thinking about what I want this blog to be. I started out with grandiose visions of being a modern day prophet. Surely, people would flock from across the globe to read my wisdom. But, noâ¦ Thatâs unrealistic. This blog is really for me. Itâs somewhere to collect thoughts that Iâve had for use at a future date.  Who am I? Well, thatâs what Iâm still trying to figure out. Iâve never fit into a convenient stereotype. I have yet to discover my raison d'Ãªtre (reason to be) if you will. Here I am, going on 26, with a great house, a great job, and great girlfriend, but still unsure if this is the life Iâll lead. But, can my life be so anonymous? Isnât there some higher calling that Iâve yet to discover?  Iâll work on thatâ¦ in the meantime Iâll keep on keepinâ on. One thing I have learned is that life must be about keeping yourself happy, and at the same time doing good for those around you. As long as I keep to those principles; other successes or failures along the way shouldnât make me feel as though Iâm frittering away my days.  That was catharticâ¦ it doesnât matter if anyone else ever reads it, it was good for me. Tilâ next time, -Scott

      This weekend was spent kickinâ ass and taking names whilst refinishing the wood floors of my parentâs Park Vista condo in Seattle. In true home-improvement, reality-show style, Jess and I battled through set-back after set-back to get the floor done before the end-of-weekend deadline. The floor a Herculean effort, and looks greatâ¦ but visitors will just see a floorâ¦ Such is life.    Wellâ¦ such is my life. I donât have a freakinâ sweet job that makes people take notice. If I were a pro-wrestler, or porn-star, or rock-n-roll writer people would build websites about meâ¦ as it is, I just make the world a better place via engineering (so I have to make a website about myself).    Thatâs all for nowâ¦ Iâll come up with something worth reading soonâ¦    Take care,  -Scott

      Yesterday I saw an advertisement for a pill that is supposed to improve your memory (ironically, I canât remember the name of the product).  But the commercial shows someone forgetting their car keys, cell-phone and such, as a cause for major alarm!  As Homer Simpson once said, âEverytime I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brainâ¦  Like the time I took that home wine-making class and forgot how to drive.â  {Marge: Thatâs because you were drunk.  Homer:  And how!}  My point is that we cram more and more stuff into our brains as we get older; of course thereâs going to be stuff that slips through the cracks.  At five years old, the biggest thing to commit to memory was when âSesame Streetâ came on.  In high school, there was your locker-combination, and phone-number.  Now that Iâm in the workinâ world, so donât hassle me if I forget my cell-phone (which I donât have).  I have to keep track of 100-different work projects, building my house, personal life, and on and onâ¦  I guess I wanted to try out this ârantâ thing people do on blogsâ¦  Hmmmâ¦ I see Iâm not to good at it.  âTil next time, -Scott

      Several thousand years ago, the Egyptians put up millions of precisely cut limestone blocks in a pointy shape.  (Later our founding father's took that pointy architectural nicety, added a glowing eye, and put it on the back of the 1-dollar-bill...)  Tonight I'm going to try to stack 60, precisely-milled glass blocks on top of a 2x6 wall to give me a working upstairs shower.  This will be the crowning achievement thus far in construction of my house...   Will it last the millenia?  Will future archeologists marvel at it?  Will there be speculation of alien technology being used?  Will it's image be used on some far distant currency???  Only time will tell.  Thus ends my historical second-ever blog post, removing me from the long lists of one-hit-wonder blogs.  Later, Mr. Scott Spahr

      After years of dwelling in anonymity; at last the world shall hear my voice!  Iâm taking the plunge into the poorly-punctuated, angst-ridden world of blogging!  Who knows what adventures will befall me in my day-to-day life that Iâll need share with the rest of cyberspaceâ¦  This is my first entry, and stagefright or writerâs block is keeping it from being an extended journal of all things Scott.  But never-fear loyal readers, I will be back as soon as time permits.  Goodbye for now, -Scott

      This Wednesday I pack things up and head for some well-earned, and much-needed vacation on the tropical paradise known as Maui.  I had to tile my Laundry room this weekend in advance of the trip - so I could wash stuff and have non-smelly clothes.  Anyway, it'll be a race to the finish tonight as I attempt to install a new washer  dryer, do several batches of clothes, pack, and try to get some rest...  I'm going to have to work at posting more often...  My mantra continues to be:  Things will one day be not busy!  Til' that sweet day... -Scott
