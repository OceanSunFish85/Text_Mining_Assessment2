       I seem to have lost interest in my blog very fast... anywho!   worked today. yay physical labour...   and now a story about the jazz festival, and a glimps into eric's mind, and desires..... beware, lol   at the jazz festival, i saw a girl selling t shirts, and i said "lets go see how much they are" so we went over, and i asked, and the girl smiled at me, and said 5 bucks... then realising i meant the shirts, and not the flashing lights, she smiled again and said 20... at this point i was in a trance... she had 1 of those smiles tht i have only ever seen on 1 person befor then, and it mezmorized me... anyway, in my trance, i went for my wallet, and realised i only had 15. and i forgot to haggle, as i was in my trance....   there are many things that can be attractive to guys, about girls... but when it comes to me: boobs? asses? HEEEEEEELL NO!, i go for the smiles! :)  so smile at me!, if i start acting dumb, u have a great smile!   bed time

       Last night, my uncle phoned me, and asked me if i wanted to go fishing with him today. And of course i said yes!. lol.. fishing is great fun!, so i packed my lunch last night, and went to bed, and got 3 and a half houtrs sleep, then got up at 4:30, got dressed/washed and ate, and my uncle picked me up at 5:00 AM. We then drove to Gravenhurst, and spent the entire day in my uncles boat, fishing. we caught nothing that we could keep.. ie: 5 inch rock-bass, perch, and small-mouth-bass. we almost caught a small-mouth-bass that we could have kept, but he got away... curses...... so we came home, empty handed, and red from the sun!.. it was a good day! i got home at 8:30, and after a day on the lake, i'm exhausted. lobster man now says "Ta ta!"

       Heyhey! I was supposed to go to the beaches jazz festival with the Chlebowskis yesterday, but Mike had too much homework from summer school, and Dave didn't want to go without Mike. Mike told me that I could still go down to the festival with his parents, but that would have been kinda wierd, as i dont know them that well. So I ended up not going.Then at 6:00 ish, I was talking to Veronica on MSN, and she told me that Justin Han wanted to go down, so the 3 of us went. V drove to the subway, and we took the subway to Queens station, and a Red Rattler (street car) to the festival. We then walked around for 3 hours at the festival.. saw many interesting things, including women that looked like men, men that looked like women, and a rock band that was trying to be a jazz band (they were horrible).  Instead of taking the Rattler back to the subway, we walked; and an hour and a half later (or more.. not sure) we got to the subway station at Queens, and got back to Finch at about 1:30 AM, and I got home at 2:15 AM. All in all, it was a fun time!   Today, Farzana came over, casue she needed my help with building a catapult for her grade 12 physics class in summer school... it had to be able to launch a marshmellow 6 meters, and after 2 hours of work, we had built it, and were able to lob the marshmellow about 9 metters, or more. It was fun :).   This evening, I went to Port Parry to sub in in adixieland jazz band, I was playing trombone, sight reading all the music... and i made $21.00 :)

       so.. this is my first  REAL  post EVER!...   I was at Jenn's B-day party tonight! i had so much fun! we basicly sat around and talked, and it was so much fun1, i haven't laughed that much all summer! I heard that Lowe found a 1 horse-power vibrating dildo on an e-bay type thing..  1 freaking HORSE POWER!!  first thing anyone said was "ow!" haha! oh it was great! Then we migrated to the basement... it was warmer down there... more fun followed.. i met people that i never knew existed! and have come to the conclusion that i need to make more friends, and get out more. Then some of us played darts, and some random beachball fun! :) I also gave Jenn a 15 minute massage, as her birthday present, which i think she thouroly enjoyed   HAPPY BIRHTDAY JENN!!!!!!
