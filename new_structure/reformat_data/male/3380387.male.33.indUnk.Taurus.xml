      Well, the issues just keep piling up.  I can't watch, listen or read anything on current events without something making my blood boil in about five seconds.   Since this is my first posting, I am unsure how to kick it off.  I should just say a bit about what (if I actually keep posting that is), this blog will cover.  Well, my interests are many, but through my life thus far my ever enduring passions are politics and restaurants.  So, I will be posting, if only for myself, my thoughts on different dining experiences here in Minneapolis.  More importantly however, I will be ranting about the political and social issues of the day.  For the former, I think that with the number of times that I dine out, (breakfast, lunch, dinner), and the fact that I don't get paid for what I say, I have, at times more credibility that the "professionals".  For the latter, I am very conservative in my leaning, but not in a scary Pat Buchanan kind of way.  We are in a hard time as a country and I don't like where we are going as a nation or global society.  Ah! Wait.  You think me saying, I don't like where we are heading, means I am attacking G. W. Bush, don't you?  Wrong.  The president has and is continuing to make some perplexing decisions, but I am not attacking him.  Stay tuned, you'll get my drift in future postings.

      Following is a quick note I sent to Bill O'Reilly following him being embarrassed by Michael Moore.   Bill,   Just an observation, I watched Moore, do what he does best, eat your lunch. Surprisingly, he didnât have a demand for chips and dip or chocolate covered doughnuts or something of like that to appear on your show. Never the less, I just watch him take you to school in your little debate. I was exercising at my athletic club during your interview and just took some notes afterward on where he got the best of you.   1) You think you would have taken the 40 seconds to look up the meaning of the word âlieâ. Be the definition of the word, Bush isnât guilty of what Moore accuses him of. Pretty simple to have missed that.  2) He said he would never have let Hitler come to power. So if President, he would have done something that he blasts Bush for doing. You mentioned it, but should have really pressed the matter.  3) He said Eastern Europe rose-up like we did in our Revolutionary War. Ours was a violent struggle; we took up arms to become free of our oppressive government. Eastern Europe didnât rise up in at all the same way. You were correct to say that our military buildup bankrupted Communism, but why did you let him correlate our revolution to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe?  4) You let him say that, âwe went to war because Bush said Iraq was an immanent threat to our securityâ. That is, by definition, a lie. Moore knows that Bush said, ââ¦ before Iraq becomes and immanent threatâ. You let that slip by without mention. I think for that along, Fox should restructure your contractâ¦ your getting paid to much to miss that.  5) You let him ask you if you would sacrifice your child to secure Fullujah. That isnât even your call. We arenât under a draft in this country; our soldiers join our armed forces by choice. And regardless, the correct response was, that you believe in the cause of liberating millions from a murderous regime; that by no means is defending the Iraqi people a death sentence and that you would be proud to have your child fight in the U.S. armed forces.  6) One more. You could have said that we went to war because for 12 years and 14 UN resolutions, Saddam lied to the world. He didnât do anything he agreed to do, he didnât stop shooting at us in the no-fly-zone, he didnât give humanitarian aid to the people that needed it, he didnât prove that he destroyed the WMDâs that the UN knew he had. He knew what the consequences were and he thought that Bush would continue down the same line as Clinton, by doing nothing. By threatening, but never following through.   You must have been bolted to your set last night, because he was spinning you like a top!  What say you, Bill?
