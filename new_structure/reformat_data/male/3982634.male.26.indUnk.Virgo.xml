      Hey all!  Chad here.  Well, we're all moved in and settled.  It's kind of a shame that we're going to move in about 6 weeks.  Tonight we are having guests over for dinner.  Chance to break in all of that new cookware!! Otherwise we're just taking it easy, trying to find our rhythm.  Preping to go to Vegas.  I'm sending out a few resumes and were looking for a nice apartment we like.  We should be there starting October.  I'm looking forward to it, I think it'll be a good challenge.  Though I admit it will be hard to leave this job.

      Hello Everyone!  This is Paige, and welcome to Chad and I's blog!  This is designed just for you to see what is going on in our lives and what we are doing.  We will try to write something every week and hopefully keep you up to date on what we do.  So today is August 6th, so we have been married for almost two weeks now.  How's married life, you ask?  It's okay!  We are busy moving my stuff into Chad's apartment and cleaning the place up.  Currently there are about 7 bags of trash by the door, but they will soon be out.  Our cat Kaos is taking my moving in well enough...I think because I feed her salmon she might like me better :-) Otherwise all is quiet here on the front.  I will write more later! -Paige

      Weddings are an exsasperating ordeal, filled with stress, and likely to send someone into a nervous breakdown. It was worth it. This morning I got up, readied myself to go to work, and before I left I tiptoed back into the bedroom to look at her. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  Ever!!  Just seeing her lying there, breathing softly, dreaming silently... I knew I would love her forever. People have been telling me for days that I'm a lucky man. They have no idea. I would have given a year of my life just to stay and hold her this morning. But alas, real life called. Real life is pissing me off.

      Creeping closer and closer. My wedding is now just four days away, and the pressure is accelerating. I now have all the measurements for the party, save one, which should be here by morning. (If I didn't mention it I'm making everyone's clothes.) The weather has been pleasent, though very hot. It's forecast to be 99 degrees Farenheit on Sunday. But there's always some wind, and plenty of shade so all should be well. Today my coworkers threw a small party in honor of the upcomming event. It made me feel very loved. I work for a Hospice. If your not familiar with what that is, it's a medical team who focus on giving care to people in the final stages of a terminal illness. It's not for people looking for a cure, but for people who have accepted that nothing more can be done to cure them, and instead want to focus on having the best "quality of life" for their remaining days. It's a very wholistic approach, both scientific and spiritually, where we seek not just to ease their pain and symptoms, but to support their emotional and spiritual health as well. We also seek to give support to their loved ones. Ours is even more unique as it's owned by someone who trully cares for others, and sees our being with them not as a job, but a treasured gift from them to us. She's a remarkable woman, as is the whole crew. I've been very glad to know them all. I work as a receptionist and medical records keeper, as well as about thirty other jobs. In most places I might hardly be noticed by them, but not in this kind of enviroment. Truly if all the leaders of the Earth had the chance to see some of the love in this place... well. I do tend to stick out here, however, being one of only three men in an office of 40+. Naturally the idea of a wedding has them all very excited. They went in together and got gifts and cards, and food for us. It sure made me smile. I will miss them very much after moving, but I will certainly keep in touch.

       As you no doubt have noticed, I have added my voice to the untold millions "blogging" on the net. While I plan to use this primarily as a place to keep track of the things going on in personal life, I will try to add info regarding life in general here in Nevada.  The current event unfolding in my life now is a wedding! Yeah, because she really is my best friend I hope to build a life with. Boo, because weddings are a major pain in the... Now, as irony has, I have a good deal of experience in planning events like this. I studied theatre in college, and there I helped to bring around a number of productions as either a designer, Stage Manager, or an actor, and frequently a combination of those. The main difference is resources. In theatre we had a good sized budget and many, many people to help. Here it's me, her, and her Mom. With a few others who are each doing a specific thing, such as flowers, the cake, etc. Still I am amazed at the challenge that having a wedding presents. The one that's killing me is the difficulty to get an officiant. Nevada is, of course, well known for it's ease in allowing a couple to marry, but if you want to be the one to marry them, it's an incredibly involved process. You need to present papers proving that you're an ordained minister, plus letters of good standing, and fill out forms, then get a background check with fingerprints. It's crazy. I bring this up because a friend of our who we wanted to perform the ceremony, will not be able to now as we've only just learned this. Too late, of course. Also to save money and for a personal touch, I opted to make the dress and the wedding parties tops. This would have been a better idea if I weren't such a procrastinator. Oh well, I'll finish, I'll just not sleep much. At least the dress is finished, at it looks beautiful. ButI can't quite fathom why we, as a culture, put so much emphasis on the details of this ceremony. It's certainly an important day, and well worth celebrating. But I'm perplexed by the need to make it such a large production. It's one thing if you're a wealthy heiress and have nothing better to do for six months, but we bothe work, went to school, and don't have all that much money, yet we're trying to make it look like we are spending a fortune. And it's not just, it's me too. I feel obliged to make a grand show of the whole thing for the sake of our families. Especially those people we never see coming in from the other side of the country. I feel this odd presure to prove to them that I'm going to be a good husband for her. And I don't usually feel pressure to prove myself to anyone, much less a gaggle of east coasters I'll more than likly never see again. Actually, that's not really true either. It's for her that I'm doing all this. Because it means something to her. I guess that's a fair reason. I just hope that if I ever have any daughters, I can help them to find beauty in simpleness.

      Nothing important is happening here.  It has been quite laid back.  Everyday life consists of getting up, going to work, coming home.  I make dinner for us most nights.  I know how to cook pretty well, but don't know many recipes.  My new Mother-in-law and one of our friends have both given me cookbooks, full of new and interesting recipes.  It's quite a bit of fun, actually.  I am learning alot of recipes with rice and noodles.  Rice rocks. Were about six weeks from the move.  I am a little nervous about going in cold.  We need to start looking for an apartment soon.  I'm just so unsure of whats happening.
