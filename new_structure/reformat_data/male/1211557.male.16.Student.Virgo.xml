      Wah, man finally off the phone after like nearly 10 phone calls to ISPs + PSTN companies. Just got my local home phone changed to Bâ¦ cos man itâs DAMN cheapâ¦ yep, I reckon it isâ¦ cos itâs only $29.95 for line rental, (which is cheaper than ANY OPTUS or TELSTRA LINE! â both above $33) and not only is it $29.95â¦ it includes 100 local phone calls!!! â we only make like around 70 or 80 per month so we never have to pay more than $29.95. much cheaper than what we pay which we used to pay (which was $33 for line rental no free calls, and then pay like up to $15 just for local calls, and then we make like an extra $15, for Mobile + STD, for international we make a local call and use a calling card which is even cheaperâ¦)  SO! - $29.95 and thatâs all why? â cos I changed ISP to iiNet. Cost only $79.95 per month, but I get $10 off, per month cos I also joined their iiPhone, which means I only pay $69.95 for like 32gb download, which I seriously doubt Iâll ever have to worry about going over, if I donât plan to download crap loads of stuff. And itâs a 512/128 connection 32gb, for less than $70â¦ then iiPhone, there are no monthly fees or anything, it just for mobile, international and STD calls, (weâll never use the international calls) but as for the STD and mobile calls, they have the cheapest rates out of all the providers I have ever seen, SO that means weâll lover that $15 to mobiles to maybe 10â¦ so if I add up everything thatâs only $100 per month for all phone and internet! â which is a much better Deal than our current $160 per month dealâ¦ so yeah, all is good =) save parents $60 per month. And weâll get to use the phone more and not pay as much.  Okayâ¦ not that you needed to know all that crap! â but man that took me agesâ¦ 1 Â½ hours to get doneâ¦ and well 328 words to type what I did =S. I spent like some time yesterday night to check out mobile plans, and then ended up with home phone plans, and I also came across the net plan SO I just got everything changed the next day. No rash decision, all figured out, been thinking about the net thing for ages.  Mobile plansâ¦ why was I checking them out? â well, supposedly my familyâs gonna have a ABN numberâ¦ meaning I can sign up for business plansâ¦ and the thing is business mobile plans have the CHEAPEST imaginable ratesâ¦ so yeah, itâll be good, only down side of things is that they donât offer Yes timeâ¦ which I guess right now isnât such a  BIG deal, cos Iâll just get people to call me, But then again, I donât use Yes time THAT often so with what I save if I wanted to phone someone even without yes time it would be worth while. BUT my contract only ends like next yearâ¦ and well I plan to by a new phone in SG or Malaysia end of yearâ¦ so yeahz. Iâll see what happensâ¦ still got heaps of time.   (man what is this guy talking about yeah??? â weirdest blog entry ever right? â hmmm maybeâ¦ )  Anyway! How was my day? â Good, cos I feel better =) but still not perfect, I actually was running late for the train on the way home, cos I wanted to go somewhere before home, so I jogged a bit, and got my heart rate maybe up 10 bpm, and well I could feel that even if I wanted to run 100m tomorrow, there was no chance I would make it to the finish line ALIVE! If I tiredâ¦ cos I think it was like the virus that could attack the heart, and well I could already feel that it wasnât good. BUT if I didnât run, I think today, was the best Iâve felt in like 2 weeks.  Spesh first period, man been awhile since Iâve had speshâ¦ Iâm so far behind, David Oh, the ultimate genius of Mathsâ¦ is like Kennyâ¦ youâve done nearly nothing this yearâ¦ no exercises no home workâ¦ if you tired Kenny you would do so much better, (well I guess who would yeah?). in some sense to me thatâs a huge encouragement, cos the fact is, right now Iâm doing spesh unlike anyone else, but yet, man Iâm KICKING like 80% of the people at BHHS!!! Now that is HILLARIOUS! â I feel like one of those people who everyone hatesâ¦ never do any workâ¦ but still can do so well =P hahahz! YES! â man how good does that feel, but yeah I think in the long term, esp when everyone revises at the end of the year, Iâm sure to fall behind.  Okay, Maths was my BEST subject by far when I was youngerâ¦ I ACED maths up to year 9 =S then well, hmmm people got better than me, and I just got used to it. So now I donât care =S Cos itâs DAVID OH, man how can you beat someone who get perfect mark, even if you tired, you can only equal him, and what the guy donât even do half the set workâ¦ but me =S I do maybe a tenth =S probably less... hmmm I guess what Iâm trying to say is that Iâm still no over this mental battle to figure out whether Iâm dumb, or that I have a brain. (not literally). Itâs not good to admit you have one, and well thatâs what Iâve refused to do for many years already, making myself believe Iâm dumb, so itâs okay to not do well, (my excuse), but then hmmm if I tired, I guess I could do better, and currently, if I tired I donât know what the possibilities could me. Maybe I could do really well at spesh? Which is kinda importantâ¦ sighz, I donât know, maybe Iâm scared that if I try and I donât do that well that I feel that Iâm stupid, cos well without trying Iâm doing =S alright, but itâs not something to commendâ¦ cos itâs pretty dodgy, since itâs no where near an A+â¦ just cos everyone failsâ¦ I guess I canât compare to themâ¦ well not canât I shouldnât. I should have higher standardsâ¦ but yeah, doesnât it feel good to feel that you kicked peopleâs bums?...  Hmmm, what I seriously wonder about is all the people who are like thinkingâ¦ what? Kenny kick peopleâs bums, and he didnât even do anythingâ¦ BHHS must be full of the biggest retardsâ¦ Well thatâs where youâre wrong, BHHS got tons of smart people, the school overall does A LOT better than average, and well is one of the schools with the highest percentage of people who get about 90 as an ENTER.  Okay, Iâm just gonna shut up nowâ¦ I just need to study and do spesh for onceâ¦ but in my head I keep thinking, if I donât try, I canât be blamed for getting a crap mark.  Haâ¦ man I write so much crap that, because of this, Iâve decided to open a new blog, and stick all this crap into thereâ¦ I need to maintain a decently level of quality of saneness in my proper blog.  Well Iâll just end this crappy post which will be my first post in my doggy blog! =) baiz
