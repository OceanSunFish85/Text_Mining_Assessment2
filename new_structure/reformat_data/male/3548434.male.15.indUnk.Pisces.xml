Jonathan" n them im like damnnnnn. "yeah errr... welllll ummmm.... most prolly".

      WARNING: author is pissed and will ramble and rant. ok. im pissed. mum chucked a psycho when she found out about me organising fundraising for our formal -.-;; that just sux. she demanded that i withdraw from organising it altogether, and im only allowed to sell 2 boxes now. far out. but that was sortta ok. and then she went on about how i go online too much and how i don't tell her when I go online ie. sneaking on without telling her. she said that she had had enough and the punishment would be that i won't allowed to go to the formal! aRgH! i'm sorry shues &gt;. RANT #1 ||| wtf cant parents (esp mine) lay off a bit? they have to follow you around and keep track of what you do, when where and why. what they don't understand is the fact that maybe if they lay off a bit, it would work out fine, maybe even better! take for example, reports. if they would let you do anything, ie. go online whenever, sleep whenever, watch TV whenever, go out whenever, etc. whose to say that one's report won't remain at a high standard. ok, maybe i exaggerated it a bit - obviously parents have to impose SOME restrictions. but can't they loosen up a bit and stop being so uptight? they aren't even willing to try and let us go wild. cant they try it once and see just how effective it is to let us have more freedom? and it's not like my results were that crap *ignores all the techs at school*. far out. its not like i have to top the class in every subject!! so why cnt parents just loosen up a bit and let us be? RANT #2 ||| why do parents, azn ones in particular have such a big problem with us mingling with the opposite sex? don't they understand, as shues pointed out, that we cannot get outta uni and find a wife/husband settle down and have kids in a flash? we need time to gradually get to that goal -- and that time is usually high school. we need to have the opportunity to communicate and understand the opposite sex. understand them as FRIENDS will be sufficient. but even talking to them as FRIENDS cannot happen because one's parents don't trust you, they don't want to risk the 0.000001% (as zbaras said, 98% of statistics are false ^__^) chance of you: a) for a guy to impregnate a girlfriend or b) for a girl to get impregnated by a guy far out! and they say WE watch too much TV...obviously they watch too much of those stupid today tonight reporters interviewing that small percentage (in comparison to the rest of em) of pregnant teens and their bfs. and also the fact that due to our absolutely obsessive love for our partners that we will fail academically. because of these factor, they believe that we should avoid the opposite sex until we get into uni -___-'' ok. let's just say (sounds like an 'even if' debate) that there is a remote chance of this happening. but even so, is it bad enough that they have to stop us from being FRIENDS with the opposite sex? KEY WORD: friends...NOT boy/girl-friend. if anyone can answer this question, please do. i'm eager to find out the answer. RANT #3 ||| this really isn't that big of a rant but i think it concerns a large majority of us. in regards to the formal, DO NOT stress. it is FOUR WHOLE months away! well i suppose for the girls...they're dresses will take forever to find so you should have started. besides that, you can all wait for a while longer to find bloody dates. calm down pplz! donât fight over ppl either. LMAO -.-" so anyway, if you skimmed through that and didn't get the most important thing about this blog, then here it is again: I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO THE FORMAL NOW *damn* SO LADIES, NO NEED TO RUSH TO ASK ME AS YOUR DATE ^__^ keke. ok, maybe the last bit wasn't necessary. hehe  anyone else not going to the formal? i would like to know, maybe we can organise something ^__^  until next time --- bye!

      I personally think that 12 for Prelim n 10 for HSC is not enuf.. cos it's just too narrow n risky...  ... IF Software Design goes well THEN     do 12 units for prelim     do 10 units for HSC ELSE     do 14 units for prelim     do 12 units for HSC ENDIF ...  ... get it?  Anyways... i'll probably do:  2 english (Fobbish me) 4 maths (though i'm not dat gud... = 45th) 2 commerce subject 2 musik 2 physics (2 not decided yet...)  = 14...

      Well me and my dad had a talk yesterday about subject selections for next year, and I was just interested in what everyone else was planning to do as well. So yeah, if you could post it up if you're a member, or leave it in the comments section that would be great. (Something serious on this blog for once... haha). Well anyway, at the moment I'm hoping to do:                    3 English                       2 Economics                   3 Maths                         2 Legal Studies                   2 Ancient History  Hmm... that's providing that I get a better rank for Maths in second semester. Now that doesn't sound too promising does it?

      Once again, it is only I who on this group blog that actually uses proper English, and spelling. I can safely say that all those below and above me will most probably be using horrible truncations and acronyms that should safely stay within the boundaries of a chat program window, and never more. I do not care how absolutely cool it may be in writing in inane and mindless gibbers, as that would really show how education is being wasted. Also the only way I could become cool would be by living inside a fridge for three months.  If one observed the frequencies of my posts on this blog, then one would be able to find out that this is only the second post so far. It is mainly because of my general style of blogging that I believe would make it stand out too much from the average blogger crowd. That is why I mainly post in my own blog, which is untainted by grammatical mutilations and second-rate spelling.  So, if anybody wants to see some real fevered ranting using correct English and suchlike, then www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com is where most of it can be found.    This post was not shameless self-promotion disguised in any form. Nor does it contain any blatant subliminal messages, although you may get an urge to join the Navy. Only sick twisted conspiracy artists, such as those claiming that table tennis is not a sport and NSB is lesser than James Ruse, would spread such profane rumours. golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer.

      Sport is da shining light in an othawise crappy week of skool. But dat light often gets dimmed by constant losing...  3rd Grade Soccer - Lost 2-1 to Epping 3rds Solo goal to Alex. Fairly decent performance  2nd Table Tennis - Lost to Epping 2nds Supposedly murdered. (Thnx Benlee)  15s Hockey - Lost 7-1 to Epping 15's THRASHED, OBLITERATED, etc.  So as one can see, our skool is quite crap at sport. I think da word "victory" got ripped out wen dey were handing free, yes dats da only ones we can afford, dictionaries to da skool.  N yes, we get our reports 2moro...WATCH THIS SPACE!!!

      yes...we won debating against chatswood high!!! not by much unfortunately...but all the same we won. technically...the debate was pathetic --- both teams defined the topic as totally different things --- they defined it too truistically though ^___^ the topic was about 'that jobs are more important than future trees". we thought it was a metaphorical debate...stupidly ignoring the environment factor in our case altogether...i spoke for like less than 3 minutes. we defined it as jobs in today's society having higher priority over family, social life and social issues (lack of environment?!?!?). they defined it truistically as developing for the future -___-'' you got to admit...it was a realli crappy debate. but now we're in the next round! yay! HAPPY BDAY JAMES! yes...a bit random. almerick...stop being a retard --- damn spamming our tagboard using alias...this applies to wannabe spammers and also james in and benlee yap *glares* and mabel...i shall 'DUH' you for the rest of eternity ^__^ keke. i modified my layout for those critical morons...ie JACK. i changed the navigation panel and also added a 'home' link as suggested by jono and jack.

      Well sure enough, I'm back, and what a bludgy week it's been. First there was the public holiday on Monday, where the Queen played no part in anybody's day off and I decided to dog Andy and buy wood (???). Then that assembly on Tuesday, where I ranted about RICE... come to think of which... COME TO RICE!!  Weekend, weekend. It's been a good one. Challenged to take God's word more seriously and spent more time reading the Bible and AWAY from the computer!!   And Andy, look seriously, your new layout's good. I mean you should see me trying to design a web page.. even Junwoo could laugh at me!! Trying to learn Photoshop myself at the moment. Oh, and check out the footer at the bottom of the page. (me!)  Hmm.. and yes. Ask me for my new email address. Don't want to put it up here just in case evil spammers are lurking on introspective...*darts eyes*  Anyway, I am sleeping too late and it's time I got some rest. So yeah maybe I'll blog during our science lesson tomorrow in class. Until then, later.

      We had da most hilarious day in chinese skool. Firstly, while we sat in our class, pretending to learn, a head teacher came along n said we were going to get kicked out by little yr 1s. And wen we moved into da hallways, where a makeshift table was used...Den i got pissed. It was fuckn cold n dim, making it a great classroom :) Afta 30 mins of pain, we eventually got to move....to a room where there was only 3 ppl. (Rove: DUUUUUHHHHHH!!!!) It took dem a goddam half n hour to find a room....where dere was only 3 ppl...Dats wen i really got pissed.   But dat was da end of da shit I had to take. During break, we dogged da teacher, went to CFN, played CS, with my team getting canned cos none of dem could get at least a 1:1 ratio (of course i could :P) n went bak with 20 mins of class to go.   Da teacher didnt even care....which was da sweet part. Den agen, were pretty "trustworthy". HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  Did neone see Zlatan Imbrahimozvic's goal agenst Italy??? ABSOLUTE PURE MAGIC b CHEEKINESS TO DA MAX...  GO DA EAGLES...KILL DA BUNNIES 2day.

       	Our school needs money and a lot of it. Sure, you may be casually strolling past NSB one day and notice all the construction work going on in the front and think âwow this school can afford to build a new carpark, turfed area and new tennis courtsâ but think about this, it took our school something like 5 years to get the permit and federal funding for that. Most of that funding came from our parents anyway leading me to think that maybe the school has just been saving all the building fund donations from parents for the past 20 years in the eventuality that despite all the governments promises, there is no way in hell that they are going to give our school money.  	In the newspapers are few months ago, we all read that NSG had a million dollars in their trust fund, which made us NSBâs realize how much better our education could possibly be if we were taught at NSG. This notion was stopped when we got to the third letter of NSG, which we understood to mean girls. Obviously this created a problem. Fortunately for us boys (and NSGâs who read this), the mind of an adolescent male supposedly thinks about sex every eight seconds, so eight seconds later we promptly forgot about that topic and found something else to think about for the next eight seconds before we got distracted again.  Recently a friend from NSG asked a group of us whether our school actually followed a curriculum. Do people think that our schoolâs poverty is really that bad? The answer to that would be yes (the curriculum question, not the poverty one), but one can never be too sure. This question was asked following a brief exchange of what we have learnt in school so far and a comparison of textbooks. I have noted that in the subject of Latin we have the same textbooks, but they are ahead of us in learning and their textbook pages a white and shiny while ours a stained, tattered and yellow. They have one textbook for all the math classes while we have like five different textbooks for each of the five math classes. âCanât afford a 150 book setâ is what I thought I heard. I put that in, in the vain hope that a highly recognized public school education official with connections to the government will read this and increase our school funding or drastically cut funding to the girlâs school.  In the same session I also learnt that the level of information the girlâs are learning is much higher than what we are learning. This matter was put to rest when a friend said âTheir teachers get paidâ, which is a fair enough comment when you think about it.  Iâm pretty sure thatâs why NSG always beats our school in HSC rankings (the fact that boys are lazy bludgers, who wouldnât do work if our lives depended on it had absolutely nothing to do with the rankings). It makes sense, paid teachers are happy teachers and itâs quite obvious that our teachers arenât happy. For instance, today one of the geography classes had a substitute teacher. As I was leaving the school for sport, I saw the real teacher drive into the school and park his car. This prompted me to wonder whether our school is really bad enough to cause the teachers to jig. Of course the teacher in question could have been in an important meeting outside of school, but for the sake of the argument Iâm going to assume that he wasnât. So in the hope that someone important will read this I offer this ultimatum. Give us money or give us some of NSGâs money. Itâs quite obvious that they donât need it, girls are supposed to be resilient and Iâm sure theyâll find a way to get more somehow. Failure to do so could result in hostile action. I mean weâve already turned the school into a terrorist training camp with âStorm the Castleâ and pretty soon youâll have a bunch of semi-intelligent terrorists running around. Now you wouldnât want that would you?

      Well i kno wayne n jack'll prolly talk bout storm da castle but I'm gonna get in first n brainwash u all. Don't kno  how dey thought our skool was a castle, mbe illusions from getting thrashed by melbourne hi in crawford shield, mbe we gotta storm dere castle n steal the shield bak next yr hey guys (sry Mr. I don't play sport and don't use sport in debatin). Wasn't even gonna go until hai chen stuffed his ankle at socca trainin, 1 hr b4 da thing, he alrdy paid so i took his spot :P (I paid him of course). Yeah it was funnish but no offence prefects but organisation sucked. ppl cheated (i was innocent of course, until i stumbled onto a stash of weapons^-^). Dere were all dese rndm cadets in our skool, quite funny really just walking past wen they're all srs n stuff, wif dere funny hats (no offence wayne, ben and co). I got wasted so i gave up and just got absolutely soaked, n it was freezin, shuda thought b4 goin wif singlet n shorts from socca trainin, but i couldn't go home :( neway our group sucked and bloody curry group wif nearly double as many ppl won. Socca 2day guess wat? they forfeit again, u kno in da 6 wks dat i've joined 3rds socca we're undefeated,not to mention the um 3 forfeits, strike, bye etc dat we had hehe. and b4 dat dey lost every game. And i won't post my h/yrly marks ,not to "show some ppl up, namely Andy, wayne" and Jack.
