      I don't really remeber my dreams I had overthere, but I do remember they were really crazy. There was one with MillÃ¥ in it. Oh now it's coming back.  We were in this house, weird hippy house that looked likea cave, and there was this lady in the house, which i think was one of my friends mother, Catherine's mother, Lyne, but it might have been the mother in Thirteen, since I had wached it just befor. So anyways, I was in her house, and then I came out, and there was this place, it looked like a cool 70's university campuss, with alot of brown and grass. Outside there were two hills in front of this place, and there I had to hide from something and i was with MillÃ¥, and other people I didn't recognize, and were just hidding between the two hills, like it talks about in the mÃºm's songs, to which i fell asleep.  it was vague, and it is even more.

      Ok so I am now at home, sweet home. After about 5 days of being far away in a little village calld St-Jean-Chrysostome.  so here is what happened :  The first day I arrived we didn't do anything, exept going to my grandmother, to swim, but I didn't, because they're super late in the weather over there, it's only 2h30 from here in car, but still they're like 2 or 3 weeks late, so it was still abit cold.  Then I went to sleep. The other day, our grandmother came to pick us up because the parents were working. Me and my cousin went at grandmother's place and we swam, watched tv and ate alot.  The third day, we wanted to go to this place called Village Vacance Val-cartier, somekind of water park. We didn't because we hadn't got a lift. Instead me and Anne, My cousin's mother, went to a place, but befor we just walked out of the house to realise there were huge hot air balloons floating right over our heads and they were starting off right beside the other house, were there is a park, So we could see those giant thingys right over our heads. It was nice. Ther emust have been like 15 of them.  Then we saw skydivers landing right where the hot air balloons departed. So there was them coming down from above and there were those bizzard ballons flying silently over us with sheldom noises of fire. It was reallllly weird. Especialy with the sunset and the sky.  So then we went where the skydivers dpertated, like this airport, miniairport, and also a class for parachuting. So we saw them going up in thesky with their little plane, which wasnt little at all from a near view. There was this unbearable smell of country side (piggy poopoo). And there was also a full piggy roasting ..with his head and skin and all. Burgh.  So we saw them going up in the air, and then 5 minutes later or so, we saw them coming from the sky and landing right beside uss. It was crazy!!!! So nice. I want to skydive. AND I COULD! If i take all my money i could do a one day class and have a dive at the end of the day.  Anyways.  In the morning we had arranged our selves so we could go to the waterpark. We did, it was really nice and my cousin got the chance to rince his eyes ( y s'est rincÃ© l'oeuil), and Yes yes, me too a bit. But not as much as him. It was really nice and we arrived one houre befor the park opened, so we had the chance to do lots of attractions befor it was full. It was swell! ahha. So my cousin met this 12 years old blond big boobed girl who looked like 14 or 15, and he played with her allday. He loves her..hahah...kissy kiss kissing! He got her number and now they're calling each other all the time.  I got HUGE sunburns which as I speak really really hurt, on my shoulders and back, my nose and my belly, and my face and everywhere. But fortunatly it got red only when i came home, so I didnt look to bad, even though I got fattso fatt fatt fatty.  And then my parents were there when I came back at my grandmothers, and now I'm home. I have to go Ã©at.  that's it.

      I realise with time that I do write alot and for peopel who are interested in it (like two...)  Well they must have alot to read when they skip a day.  here are some lyrics I like too.   From BjÃ¶rk :    Why is Daddy not here?   are you crying?   why?   does he still love me?   will you take care of me?   if you both love me so   why don't you love each other   Mummy's gone missing   and Daddy's on fire   daddy's on fire   daddy's on fire    . Indeed it talks about parents who don't love each other or fight or divorce. Which I am indeed soaked in.

      Ok so the rest has no link, it's just an other dream, and what a weird one.  It was winter and I was in skis and it was in the 16th century, well that's what it was suposed to be, but still I was skiing under a viaduc (where a road goes over another one) and i was going up and I was having trouble and the cars were goimng fast by me. It wasnt 16th century at all, but I dont know.  Then One of a friend of mine came by me in bike and was going fast and tehre was anothe guy with him The friend was Mathieu Cain TremblÃ©. Then when I had been over with going up the road, I saw mathieux's father, who strangely enough was Claud menieur, in a forest with white snow, and he was in a car. We walked to his house and then I entered. We talked about how mathieu was in the movie called Familia in which i played a little background role. then it was weird we suddenly were in the house in which the role i had was shot. Then we talked and I felt super competitive with him The reason why it was claud meunier wa sbecause I also had a little casting role in a serie he realised and he playied in and i sw him that day.  So that was weird, and mathieu is just really rich. He liveson my street and has a huge house getting bigger by the months.    so that's it.   oh and Thanks   MYLÃNE   for reading me, i feel honoured.

       Fuck her  Now It's been about a week or two that she's been bothering me about me washing her car. I don't want and I once said no. Then she said ok then we wont give you money or a lift to go to the shisha cofee. We had a huge argument and I just ended up running away from my house with money i had... Then they said oh no you didnt want to wash the car so then after ward they said no again to money or a lift.  So it had been 3 things.  Now she asked me again and i said : no way, you've given me enough shit for it, do it your self. You think I'll wash your car after that.  So now she said : ok then your not going to have money for quebec. Then I said fine, then I won't go. But, I will go i think just not to have to see them.  They piss me off these days. They...they're just really rude.  I hate rude people. That's the worst thing.

      An other fucked up dream.  So I was walking on the jaque cartier bridge with some people I don't know, but in the dream I did.  We were walking and then one of them jumped into the water, but the water was really near the bridge.  Then we start walking under the bridge and we end up in this room, which looked like my neighboor's house.  Then inside there was a bunch of people i seamed to know. There was something about us being controlled by this grand mother inside the house. There were no lights and or very very little and the sealing was very low. We were like..laying on the ground. Then i changed room and went infront of something I couldnt see but it had some light coming out of it. There were those cossins (coussins). We were sitting there and there was mÃºm's Summer make good sounds coming from the light. It was very dark and dimm , both the ambiance and the lightning.  Then I took the phone and some distoritioned sounds were coming out of it, and i was putting it very near my ear and listening to it calmly. it was the distortions of mÃºm's songs. Then I lifted one of the sofa's arm because everyone was telling me to hide something in it. I didn't know what to do, nor what it was. So then I did and i left in a litle hole under a coussin.  Then I found my self walking in somekind of path outside with a GPS in my hands with 2 or 3 friends. It was still dimm and dark, but not completely night. We were walking like betwene two fields of cultivated earth, but it was rather very very green grass. There was hill behind us and, well I was seeing it in 3rd persone., like if it were a movie. Behind the hill there were buildings and houses, but mostly little buildings. It was like passed sunset, but still we oculd see fairly good. We were walking and we were pointing the city with the GPS as if we had to do go towards the cirty but we were going away from it.  It was in iceland. Then I can't really remember...the rest. But I woke up with MÃºm playing...   ....

      I decided that the song Hidden Place by BjÃ¶rk would be the offical song of etienne.  This isn't nessesairly so because of the quality of the song, but rather what it says .     HIDDEN PLACE  "Through the warmthest cord of care  your love was sent to me  I'm not sure what to do with it  or where to put it I'm so close to tear  and so close to simply calling you up  and simply suggesting   (that)We go to that hidden place  He's the beautifullest fragilest still strong dark and divine  and the littleness of his movements hides himself  He invents a charm  that makes him invisible hides in the hair  Can I hide there too?  hide in the hair of himseek solace  sanctuary  In that hidden place   [Now, I have been slightly shy  but I can smell a pinch of hope  to almost have allowed once fingers  to stroke  the fingers I was given to touch with  but careful careful  There lies my passion hidden  here lies my love  I'll hide it under a blanket  lull it to sleep  I'll keep it in a hidden place]   He's  the beautifullest fragilest  still strong  dark and divine  and the littleness of his movements  hides himself  He invents a charm  that makes him invisible  hides in the hair  Can I hide there too?  hide in the hair of himseek solace  sanctuary  In that hidden place "  Indeed make the link between hidden place and Iceland...  It really is representative of me i find.  Even though it's quite ketaine and I know it.  Kitch, cliche or what ever.   But this means not that it is the only super magical song of me. many others. Like possibly ViÃ° erum meÃ° landakort af pÃ­anÃ³inu, but mÃºm.   Wow i made 3 posts none stop.

      Ok so I have this strong image in my head now. And that's something I love to share with others. Now all you need is to know what ReykjavÃ­k looks like abit. Little streets with appartements and houses, nothing special..  So I allways get this VERY VERY strong image when I listen to Vespertine , an album af BjÃ¶rk.  It's the National day in Iceland. and the sky is grey, but not dark grey, just uniform grey, and it just rained. so the streets are wet. It must be 2 in the afternood and there is abit of a smell of halloween, even though its june 17th.  So there are all those people in the streets and their just walking and celebrating.  And the sky is grey, everything looks great, the houses are colourfull, the old mixes with the new, and thats just it. but tehre are so many deatails. Like a little ballon a little girl is holding of Hecule the movie by..something like walt disney. Its on a corner. The streets were closed to pedestrians. There i something like a fountain somehwere on the right. Thats where the young kids are sitting, like 13 14 15 16. With their cool hair and hard looks. There are parents and it looks like there is a little bank in the upper right corner, with grey and metal. and people are happy, and bjÃ¶rk plays in the backhground her beautifulest songs. Heirloom(which i allways said : heil room), An echo a stain, sun in my mouth, cocoon.  That's it.

      Ok.  So now I'v spent only two days with my cousin and I'm really pissed.  He's just so, unpolite, has no respect, he's from the back-land.  He sounds acts and speaks and dresses and everything like a big "collon" we call in french. He puts ugly t-shirts way to large for him with holes in them, huge shorts, he's dirty and God knows how I hate being unpure.  I wish I could take a shower BUT THE******* BROKE IT!!!  And he keeps on and on begging for some sweet pee o ar en. It's so anoing and now I have to windex the keyboard and mouse all the time because..it's dirty. Urgh.   How can someone live like that.  I have to tell him to take showers.  And I know for a fact that he's doing his little stuff with his little thing in it. Which disgusts me. I don't...IT'S WHERE I WASH! I don't need someone elses little babys to put on me.  Now we went to the biodome today (pwash, so touristish) but we never entered because suprisingly there was quite a waiting line awaiting us.   So now It's weird I wish I could just be alone.   And, he's so anoing.   When in the subway going back home we were walking out of the train, he sayd : hey stop I wanna show you somethin'. So I unpaiciently said : What now. I hope it's not a girl with big boobs. (because he...he OMG . He watched a girl with fairly big breast for 20 minutes in the train. HE WAS STARING AT HER with his eyes whide open and practicly having saliva runing form his dirty mouth, since he does speak like an unscholarised ass. and when we're watching tv he keeps saying "oh wait, Ehn look! Wow! Wait change it back!" just so he could see like..tiny bitses of breasts and asses. GOD HE'S ANOING!) and so i said ok tell me what it is or i'm going. Then i just started walking to the Universiter de sherbrook Longueuil station. Then he told me :" Oh it was just a bilboard about Drumsticks, but it looked good." Then my nerves just broke loose and I yelled at him : YOU ARE SO UNELLOCANT, INPERTINENT AND IMBECIEL. ITS A BILBOARD I SAW THOUSANDS OF TIME YOU IMBECILE BOILING BUCKET OF SHIT!   I know it's mean. But I just couldn't have this anymore.  Now I'm on the pc and he's playing Vice City, and he keeps saying : Hen Va chien (ah go to hell) to people in the streets of the video game.  AND HE BROKE MY SHOWER:::WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!!! ESPECIALY WITH HIM...  I DONT THINK I WANNA GO AT QUEBEC ANYMORE.  but i think it's because im the host and I feel responsible.   oh and he keeps telling me : look look . for stupide senceless and insipide shit like, he got a motocycle in the game. LIKE I NEVER SAW ONE. my father has 2..   haha...   and now I feel bad because I treat him really bad. But that's all I can do. He really is a lost case.   I really like that Icelandic singer from ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur ( frÃ¡ Ã­safirÃ°i).  Mugison .  It's actualy extreamly high quality music for a guy alone and from ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur.  It's not the happiest songs in the world, but definitivly worth listening.     Anyways now.   I have trouble not thinking of someone I shouldn't be thinking of. Since I decided I wouldn't anymore because it's just hurting my mind and lying to my self.      Part II :   So yesterday I went at gailer's.   Ah do I adore him. He's just my only male friend. I have none other.  It's weird.  He really is so......sooo......sooo cool. If I were gay, I think I would love him.  Haha....   Gailer, Ich liebe dich, und nicht fÃ¼r du bist von Ãsterreiche.  Wow must that be bad german.   That's it for now.     Ãg Sakna ykkur gailer millÃ¥ mylÃ¥ kÃ¥r Ã¥nÃ¥is och heila the others.

      Ok so I had a weird dream.   I dreamt that I was at competition , a swimming competation and that i was in my present state, which is fat and untrained since i stoped because i fucked one of my vertebra.   So then i was superstressed, and when came my race, i was unready and i hadnt put my glasses on. There was ahuge crowd.  So i didnt even have something to hid my hair which i cant remember the name : casque de bain.     And so i stood up on the block. I couldnt stand on igt, i had no equilibrium what so ever.  I just kept falling on the guy beside me. They named the peoples time and it was like all 21s, 23s and one guy 28s, on the 50m freestyle, which is my record (28s). So then i really couldnt swim.  Then the juge was getting ready to give the start when i just felt on the group. he said ok lets stop the race and we'll start over again in a few minutes. so i jumped into the water and started to train.   Then it switched to a little island where there was a tunnel under a rock. I was swimming really fast and treianing to get faster for the race. Alixe was watching me.  Then i started to run on teh sand. It was really cartoony.  Then there was this little buttler, the clichÃ©est of all. HE then thought be trapesis. The thing you hang from and swing in the air and then i was really good then it stopped.   But the part where i couldnt stand on the starting block was really so uncomfrotable.  I reallt felt like crap. I wasnt even able to stand!!!   ah this really reflects my fear of not being good enough to start training again so now im asking me self again if i should swim again. I fi really want to. since Iv allways done this, aksing my self if i realyd id want to stay on swimming and sometimes i really wanted to quite and im allways saying to my self that ill be motivated and ill do it and ill ask damond my trainer never to let me fail.  but now....     ahrg...swimming.  it's such a relief but such a pain.   I guess i'll ask and ill do it. I have to. It's my only motivation for school.     that's it for now, folks!

      I love the live version:  Ã©g Ã¡ heima viÃ° sjÃ³inn og Ã¡ nÃ³ttunni Ã¾Ã¡ kafa Ã©g niÃ°ur undir allar iÃ°ur niÃ°ur Ã¡ hafsbotninn og Ã©g lÃ¦t Ãºt akkeri* hÃ©r vil Ã©g vera hÃ©r Ã¡ Ã©g heima.  I live by the ocean and during the night(s) I dive into it underneath all currents down to the bottom andI drop my anchoooooor this is where I'm staying this is my home  * this is the line i'm not sure. would lÃ¡ta mean something here? is it Ã©g lÃ¦t?  I know now that it is from this song that the word i keep saying in my mind and that I have been saying for sometime now comes. I always use to say : Udahkeri in my mind, for no reason, meaning nothing, just a nice sound to say. and it obviously comes from "Ãºt akkeri", and in the real version BjÃ¶rk says : og sett akkeri mitt Ãºt.  ask me for the song and you will clearly hear the "udahkeri".

       Bah my cousin is comming tomorrow.   I'll try something i did befor with someone irish. Sorry.      Now 'm finaly having inspiration for my language.   it's superb!      I'm working on the tenses and I made the new cases.   here is the word Young man "umoni" in all the cases that there are yet.   1. umoni (nominative)  2. uvoni (accusative)  3. uhoni (prepositional [dative])  4. uhonÃ« (genitive)  5. uhonin (illative)  6. uhone (ablative)  7. uhonis (essive)  8. umone (vocative)   -plural   1. umonni (nom)  2. uvonni (acc)  3. uhonni (prep)  4. uhonnÃ« (gen)  5. uhonnin (ill)  6. uhonne (abl)  7. uhonnis (ess)  8. umonne (voc)      and now the word student : "egonos"   1. egonos (nom)  2. esonos (acc)  3. eÄonos (prep)  4. eÄona (gen)  5. eÄonan (ill)  6. eÄonas (abl)  7. eÄonos (ess)  8. egonas (voc)  - plural  1. egons (nom)  2. esons (acc)  3. eÄons (prep)  4. eÄonsa (gen)  5. eÄonsan (ill)  6. eÄons (abl)  7. eÄons (ess)  8. egons (voc)      But both have irregular declensions because one ends in a vowel and the other one as the -s ending, which morphes abit when it comes along other endings. Exemple : egonos &gt; egonas comes from egonosa, but since the -s ending is present in the noun, then the o goes away and the ending absorbs it, kinda like osmosis. Yeah maybe i could call it the Osmosis -s.   Done.      And then earlier today I glued 3 fingers of mine with crazy glue. Weird enough it became very very hot at the moment. They staid glue together for about 2 seconds but it heated up really quicly.   Now my cousin is comming tomorrow. We'll probably go see gailer.   I miss him, but it's like with music. When i look at his name or at mÃºm right now, I say that i like it and all but i just...don't feel like it. I'm afraid of listening to it. I think i just see the pain in my back from gailer's confortable sofabed, which i really hope is going to change it.   But i doubt we'll sleep there with my cousin and all.   We'll just take the lastbuss or so.      Now I don't feel like going do my exercises.   But i have to.   Later...   I feel weak.   I'd need Jake LaLanne super jus extractor.

       Ok so yesterday was a pretty fine day. at 8pm i went at cinema guzzo, and i waited until 8.40 to meet my friends.   And so, we walked from the cinema in which we watched no movies, to a cafÃ© called   Sphinx, where it actualy is a Shisha place.      So we go there and I didn't know, so then I was pretty suprised.   I was with Cassendre and Stephanie.    They're used to smoking, but I certainly am not, since I only took one puff once of pot.      So then they ordered raspberry shisha. They smokes some and tried to convice me, but i refused.   Then I said yes. They told me I wouldn't feel a thing, just like if i was breathing normal air.   It tasted abit odd, but it was ok.   I hadnt felt anything at first.   But then when i took a mighty big breath of it a held it in my mouth.   When it got out I felt like i was simply falling, endlessly falling from nothing.   It was unbelievable.   i'm really not on drugs so i never had a buzz or anything, but that was wow.   i know it sounds stupide but for me.      I was soooo relaxed.   SOOOO relaxed.   SOOOOOOOOO RELAXED   and boy i must say, that is like...smokable viagra.   it gave me somekind of hormonal boost and cassandre agreed with me.  I have to buiy one and smoke some befor bedtime haha.  so it continued on and on with cindy jessi and catherine coming along.  me and jessi went sleeping at catherine's place. it was nice.   and then i took picture for my carte soleil and i look so ugly...

       Ok svo.    Now I don't know what to think after what millÃ¥ told me.    Should I really write what i think or what people would think I think.    Because I know people have some how a littlely distored image of what I am.    I know people might think that it's phony not to show the real sig.    But I do it out of experience. I know people usualy get pissed at me over my interogations [like this one], and my paranoyas, and my feelings that are way to complexe for people to pay attention to.        Svo.        Well just that is a real thought of the real me.        What the heck.    I won't write all.        Anyways, I'm writting this to no one. It's just somekind ofopen journal    but..the question I should really ask my self : Is it something that should be done for one to open its thoughts to its friends?        Well I will see. But I don't need to spoil no more friendships. I've had enough of failures this year.        Damn I feel like swimming so much.  I want toswim [I know why : I'm listening to the stroke, which is forever assosiated with swimming.  That's it for now.

       OK so yeah maybe it looks like the night at the movies was boring but it wasn't.    I was simply left with a hunger because i had missed her much and now I haddn't talked enough and stuff.    I stood there watching a spider instead of...    instead of I don't know.    But...why am I even saying this I don't need to justify my thoughts.        I write here my thoughts to who ever is willing to waste/spend its time on them.        Now i'm wondering why ...    heu wait I don't quite remember.

       Wow, I just tooka shower, washed my cloths and fold them, exercised, and passed the iron on the clothes.        I'm in a motivation trip. It usualy happens when things go wrong and I feel I can do something about it, and now I do feel I can.    Yesterday there was an issue about my belly. Which quite honestly I was very very shy about, I felt humiliated.    I did get fat, since I stoped swimming and now there are strong changes for me not to swim again becaue of my cheap parents. Well they might not be cheap but they just are so fucking stupid to spend so much money on wine and cigerattes when instead they could give it to me. I know this sounds unbelievebly selfish and egocentrical, but I can honestly say that the money would be much much much better placed if they did place it on me. I would have better grades from the motivaton swimming would provide me, also from the time befor trainings it would give me, and since I would have little time to fool aorund, I would be more serious. It's kind of an army camp where you can actualy achieve something.    And it's not as if I was poisening THEIR air and giving them much greater chances of lung cancers and i was making their house smell like fucking shit. Especialy in the winter.    In the winter my dad comes here, down stairs and smokes. he smokes and smokes. and he opens the window of one inch, and it's a side-sliding window thats not provingding much air even in summer when fully opnuÃ°. There really is nothing I hate more in life then when my dad and mom smoke around us like we did have lungs or noses.    It smells like fucking crap and it's very very very polluting and bad for my lungs. I'm astmatic thanks to them.        Then they complain that the house smells bad because we don't clean it enough and they make us clean it. AS IF IT WASN't 100% THEIR FAULT.    Argh I hate cigarette so much. And especialy that they buy like the toxiest brand that smells the worst. Being around someone who smokes normal cigarette isn't so hellish, but them,...        Last winter I had the hugest argument with them. I screamed so hard after my mom and dad that I wasn't even crying, I was just having very violent spasmes. I wrfote them a 5 page letter. I was taking 3 showers aday in order to physicly and mentaly clear my self from the impurties they brought me.             ...I needed to say it.

       I'm really anxious about bjÃ¶rk's new cd MedÃºlla. I'm just abit afraid I won't like it, because she says it's very very mainly vocal, and god knows I don't like them vocals.   And, If I am not to like BjÃ¶rk anymore, I don't know... I guess it will be somekind of change for me. She's been part of my personality since I was in 5th grade. I know it sounds typical and kitch, but..It's really something big. That's something that helped me become what i am now.        thoughts...they're vague.

       I was tired yesterday.    Thinking about it some more, it was fun.    Yeah I had a good time.        Now I'm all suprised because when I came down after waking up, I saw my brother's girlfriend, which we all thought had slipt up. It seems not, but never the less I still have harsh feelings towards her. She's ...weird and she doesn't like me. And neither do I.        Now I really feel like listening to Vestpertine Bjarkar [bjÃ¶rk's vespertine].        I hope I will have at least one exiting moment in my day, other than RaphaÃ«l [the girl friend].        Oh and yesterday my dad slept on the couch and I heard my mom walking in the house at around 2 in the morning yelling to my father and this morning she was gone.    I really hate it when that happens. I feel uncomfortable where I live.        Ãah...

       I went to see spider man with camillÃ¥, it was nice.    the c-g's aren't that good.    but yeah its nice.    we didn't get to talk much and i had quite an awkward lift home starting with me hurting my knee real bad against the car byt trying to enter it. then i started talking about stuff which truly i shouldn't have talked of : trainspotting and a movie about gay people, telling her father how i saw them when i was young and stuff.    and then..i think i started talking over a conversation they had.    oh quite unpleasent.        overall i'd give a 3/5 note to the night    hah, i should give notes to night more often.        i wish i got to talk more with her. i think she was abit weird because i kind of laughed when she kind of cried, but i just thought it was cute.    anyways.        now im tired but i wont go to sleep.    i need to change my ideas.        Ãg bÃ½ viÃ° sjÃ³inn    og Ã¡ nÃ³ttunni    Ã¾Ã¡ kafa Ã©g nÃ­Ã°ur    a  lveg Ã¡ hafsbotninn    undir allar iÃ°ur    og sett akkeriÃ° mitt Ãºt    HÃ©r vil Ã©g vera    HÃ©r Ã¡ Ã©g heima        i love that song

       I'm planning to go to Quebec, well Saint-foy sometime this week, and I'm hesitating, because then will all my friends be by, and I won't. But in the other hand, I miss Quebec and swimming and everything.    OH damn it! I don't have a bathingsuit! I absolutly don't want to swim in my speedos, especialy now that they unpleasently turned Brown!        So probably for a week will I be away, and I still munu miss my friends.        J'espÃ¨re qu'on va se voir un jour ou l'autre, Ã§a fait toujour Ã§a anyways aprÃ¨s le boom du dÃ©but de l'Ã©tÃ©.        And now I am dry of inspiration for my language making "Glossopoiesis".    I don't have inspiration and am stuck in a Music-block. I don't listen to music, but only to some pieces, over and over again, which I hate to do. I guess I over mÃºmed.                        I wish I would have something else to do.    But hey, I don't.        M'enuis, Pis j'm'enuis de mes amis.        I'm bÃ¶red, and I miss my friends.

       This is the beginning.    I have some ideas of what I I will write in here, but it is to come    right now I'm just bÃ¶red and out of stuff to do.    My Icelandic is going alveg nicely these days, and I am learning faster then I thought I would. Indeed this is greatly thanks to Atli and Solla sem Ã©g reynsla meÃ°.     urlLink www.solla.tk  is the person who inspired me to do this thing, and she is much responsible for the level of Icelandic I can use today, because she allowed me to practice, which I had never done before. Though my level is still considerably low, I believe it is nice to see amelioration.        Now I miss Camille so much. She is my friend, if one would use that word. She was away and now she's come back earlier, so I'm really happy.  She yet has a boyfriend, but I don't mind at all, it gives a certain dynamic to our relation.    I guess I just had her on my mind     And so my parents want to oblidge me to stay for supper tomorrow because friends are coming over, but tomorrow is my only chance to be with Camille since she is going away somewhere deep in my land, for some time, like two decades.    I'll miss her and I would rather spend my time with her and as a matter of fact with anyone of my friends, but since I missed her svo mikiÃ°, I would like better to be with her.    Anyways..How do I put people on my list for them to come here. Maybe people will have interest in my life.    Oh my presentation, how fool of me.    I am named Ãtienne Poisson, am Canadian French, or a Quebecer. I am 15 years old, go to high school in my final year in September, have a brother of 19 years old, with all his hair, and two parents.

      Oceania, the song that bjork performed, is SO very very very very good! unbeliavably good after 80 hearings.  It's very very good. I can't find any other words. It's simple and melodious.  I adore bjÃ¶rk so much...  BjÃ¶rk nÃº hefur hÃºn geriÃ° Ã¾aÃ° aftur.  And a dream. I had such a wierd dream. I dreamt that I was at a little hill outside somewere, whith buildings near by, and that everything was made of rectangles. It was very hard to see it, because everything was hard. As if it had become a puzzle. Everything was hard and unclear. but everything was rectangle  One breath away from mother oceania your nimble feet make prints in my sand You have done good for your selves Since you left my wet embrace and crawled ashore every boy is a snake is a lily every pearl is a linx is a girl sweet like (harmonie???) made into flesh haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa you dance by my side children sublime you show me continents i see the islands you count the centuries i blink my eyes hooks and spears waves in my waters sting rays are floating across the sky little ones my sons and my daughters haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa your sweat is salty i am why i am why i am why your sweat is salty i am why i am why i am why i am why  The lyrics are written as if bjÃ¶rk was the ocean, talking about the humans. greeks.

      I'm very inspired. I've just redone a huge featur of my language, which was gradation. Gradation is how a consonant, or vowel, changes in a word for some obscure reaons. Sometimes it's by natural proces. this is not to be confused with lieanation, which is to eas the pronounciation, as in irish.  Befor it was to weird. Now it's more sencefull. I've written 6 pages on that. I have to do the verbs again....burgh.    And I've been listening to this cool song, which I find nice because when I was little I use to cry about this.  The song is really weird, bizzard and funny. Tom waits' just weird.  It doesnt't look like what it is at all looking at the lyrics. I remember the video of that song. It's just tom disguised as a littler boy, still has he a beard. He has this little ha on his head, or so I think. He's hidden under a table that's very vey little, so it makes him look huge. it's weird, it's like a little banjo and a countre base and sounds like an electric guitar in the back, but it's just noise. his voice sounds really funny, like if it came from really deep in his thoath.  here's how it goes :  When I'm lyin' in my bed at night I don't wanna grow up Nothin' ever seems to turn out right I don't wanna grow up How do you move in a world of fog That's always changing things Makes me wish that I could be a dog When I see the price that you pay I don't wanna grow up I don't ever wanna be that way I don't wanna grow up Seems like folks turn into things That they'd never want The only thing to live for Is today I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set I don't wanna grow up Open up the medicine chest And I don't wanna grow up I don't wnna have to shout it out I don't want my hair to fall out I don't wanna be filled with doubt I don't wanna be a good boy scout I don't wanna have to learn to count I don't wanna have the biggest amount I don't wanna grow up Well when I see my parents fight I don't wanna grow up They all go out and drinking all night And I don't wanna grow up I'd rather stay here in my room Nothin' out there but sad and gloom I don't wanna live in a big old Tomb On Grand Street When I see the 5 o'clock news I don't wanna grow up Comb their hair and shine their shoes I don't wanna grow up Stay around in my old hometown I don't wanna put no money down I don't wanna get me a big old loan Work them fingers to the bone I don't wanna float a broom Fall in and get married then boom How the hell did I get here so soon I don't wanna grow up  That's it. I'll print my huge text.

      MÃM  ERU  KOMIN  AFTUR  MÃºm is back, with a little cd. It has three new songs. One i'm now listening, called Boots of fog. It's very very heavy with sounds. I feel I will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it's not the complete song.  DAMN I'M ANXIOUS ABOUT SEPTEMBER THE SIXTH!!!!!  I will buy it so much....    anyways....  Today me and alixe went into the big city, Montreal.  we went to eat diner at a little restaurent. it was quite fine indeed. I got to taste quesedillas for the first time! it was delightfully good.  Then we went at cinema-duparc and we saw this movie called  Maria Full of Grace. It's reallllly good. seriously. me who really has trouble with anything hispanic, I believe this movie was great! it's about a young argentine girl who becomes a mule. A mule is a girl, who takes kind of huge things filled with cocaine into her stomach, in little compressed baloons and pass it on through the frontiers into the usa.  And she's pregnent.  One of her friend's balloon broke into her body and she ends up kinda dying from the cocain in her stomach. and the rest of the movie is how they try to get back to argentine.  It's really good.  and then we came back to alixe place, we ate supper and I'm now here.  For some reason, everytime we were being served by someone, we spoke the opposite language, by mistake, and so there were super huge missunderstandings. well it just happened 2 or 3 times.  like the lady comes to us at the restaurent and she heard us speaking french, so she gives us our table, and tries to speak french very badly and we do nothing to tell her about the fact that we speak english. And then we talk english to this french guy to give us icecreams. And...  Well that was awkward.   urlLink http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=130FATSESS=d535115792e52818c6eb2fdad9d47d75   mÃºm's songs' delight.   I feel like going to iceland.  It's nearly midnight. I'll go to bed.  I miss my freinds.  It seams like evryone's dead. No one is making anything. I hate that part of summer.  Should I call anyone.  og ennÃ¾Ã¡ lÃ­tar millÃ¥ ekki aÃ° sakna min.

      This crappy website works once every 3 times. I hate it.  These days, I've come back and still haven't seen anyone. I'm kinda very bored.  I let my self go because there is no one to care about it. I'm anxious about school for one reason and it is the 2 showers a aday plus 8 times brushing my teeth...I miss that. But I won't do it.  And yesterday I tried to creat something for Glossopoiesis, but it was a real mess. I hate when that happens.  I'll concentrate on verbs ....  jÃ¦Ã¦.

      I can remember vividly that I had a dream, in which I was singing a song from mÃºm, it was a very detailed, credible and quite possibly a real song from mÃºm. I think I heard it at the concert, and i remember writting the lyrics, but then when the song would end I couldnt remember them perfectly, but I could play the song over and over in my head, it never changed All I remember was this  in the begining """ = i cant remember yes yes you """"""""""""""""""""""""""" [something about a boat]  It was like a video clip.  I was lying on my back, in somekind of icelandic landscape, similar to the one in the bjÃ¶rk's video of JÃ³ga.  but there were high grasses, the sea was very very dark, like dark deep blue practicly black, there were sheeps far away, a few hills, and rocks near me. I could see only things near near me, and it was half real, half like in a video clip. I could sing the song again and I was seeing the lyrics apear somewhere, and all I really remember is it started by "yes yes" it was slow and it had crackles stadles klicks and shvivles.    DAMN  I want to go see a hypnotizer so I can remember it...  I'm really...grrr i wish I would remembver it.  I know it was somekind of long version of a little song for an intro to the first song of the concert.  ill rephrase that.  In real life, in the concert of mÃºm was an intro to a song, it was long In my dream, it was like if i knew that the song was the even longer, fuller version of that song, a real song.  i remember i can still see the word yes yes written in white over the images of the dream.    i have to stop making weird dreams like that.

      I had super much trouble yesterday getting into this site, my password wasn't working anymore, and now it's working, but still I was scared.    ÎÎ¬ ÏÏÎ³ÎµÏÎµ Î±Ï' ÏÎ®Î½ ÎÎ»Î»Î¬Î´Î± Î¼Î­ ÏÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎºÎ±ÏÎµÏ Î±Î½Î±Î¼Î½Î®ÏÎµÎ¹Ï!   Vous repartirez de la GrÃ¨ce avec de trÃ¨s beaux souvenirs!    I'm much anxious about going shopping with Alixe. It'll be Netto! Ha, Netto, I miss Caroline, and her funny mother. (SHE'S SWEDISH - HUN ÃR SVENSK!)  I'll buy all new clothes. Perhaps I intend to change my usual clothes, and change them for something new, I'm craving newness! I need new stuff, everything looks like it's my little brother, which I have not!  Oh, When I'll see Caroline again, I'll ask her for her little, well big thing book-like swedish lessons thing, it's from The Institute of Sweden (SVENSKA INSTITUTET),  FÃ¶r mig finns svenska sÃ¥ snygg som sprÃ¥k, och vill jag lÃ¤ra det, fÃ¶r snygga sprÃ¥k Ã¤r roliga att tala, och roliga att lesa.  Svenska, med norska Ã¤r snygga sprÃ¥ken pÃ¥ vÃ¤rlden, men mig finns IslÃ¤nska ocksÃ¥ snyggt fÃ¶r, fÃ¶r det Ã¤r islÃ¤nskt.  There might be mistakes... There are mistakes as a matter of fact, I'm sure of it.   I find the creacky voice sweds have when they speak very cool, even sexy for a girl. It's very very very perticular that sound they make when speaking, it's....really cool.

      I'm back!  Me and my parents went in this little village just under the Saguenay fjÃ¶rÃ°, a little village called Saint-SimÃ©on.  It was nice, it was higher than La Malbaie. It's a village where most activities are relied to whalewatching. and it has about one road, plus one going down to the little harbour.  We stayed at a motel, we didn't do much exect going to places. The nicest one we went to was called Port-Au-Percil. We ate our supper down by a little water fall on smooth quite horizintal rocks, and at the end of it, in a llittle bay was a patch of grass upon which was a biog old rock. There were old trees and it was a place where big ducklike birds came to live, and thus, in thehigh grasses, was full of little poopoos of duckies.  C'Ã©tais des oies, des genres de bernaches, ou un mot du genre. C'est gris avec du noir pis du blanc, et c'est relativement gros.     And we also went to a little village, which also was basicly a road, called Baie-des-rochÃ©s, or rocky bay.  This is francly one of the most beautiful place I've seen in QuÃ©bec. It was a huge inner bay, and when we were there it was 70% dried out, because the tide was low. and there were all those nice places.  Ah i hate when I dont write in a long time. I've got to much to tell, but I wont, because i have to much to write.   the coolest thing is, when I had this dream  I had a bizzard dream about my very very best penpal, the great Jan Zacharias Van Rookhuijzen, or Janric.  It was in belgium, but not at all. It was in quebec, but in belgium. It was at my former cousin's house, not my former cousin, but my present cousin's former house, when he was still my cousin, and styill is, since he is not my former cousin.  Anyways, at my not former cousin's former house, there was him, and janric. janric was there and I knew he had newly come. It's weird, because I can't remember the things' order. I just put it back in a logicallike order.  Then something happened, and we were going to holland in train. We were at the trainstation, we were getting in this bus, and everything was dimm, and nothing was really clear, and I felt like everything was lit with little yellow lights put on trees. Inside the buss was like a little tunnel. were on the sides were little seats. Then I got into the buss, the mister riped a part of my ticket, but then a probleme, janric didnt have his ticket, so I had to get of the bus and then there was afeeling of confusion and frustration. I felt a very close friendship with janric, as if we had known each other for a long time, practicly brothers. it was very special. IIN my dream though, when I would look at his face, then be it deformed and bizzard.  Then we got of the train, or was it a bus, or both?  After that, I think it is this that should follow : We were in montreal, in a crassy, ugly dirty unpleasent cold metro station. There was a big line to enter it, and janric and i were in a hurry, i guess we had to take new tickets. The thing was that, to get into the stationl, we had to pass through very hard to get through holes, that had a 40Â° angle, going up, as if the station was upper and the only way to acces it wwas that little tunnel. It was no larger than a normal persone, and we couldnt see what disgustingnesses were inside it, because light couldnt get in it.  I don't remember us going through it, I think this part of the dream ended there, but I just remember a real incomfort infromt of this.  An other part of this scattered dream is the part were we are just there. Nothing is happeneing. we're in someplace, not identifiable, but it was more of a feeling then an image. It was just the feeling of finaly seeing him janric (hann JanrÃ­k(ur)), yet having this feeling of actualy being a comeback rather then a finnaly arrived. It was weird. It was a very real feeling, not this far unreal feeling. i was sad when I woke up, because alot of time is ahead as for our first meeting.  I often wonder what janric is like in real life, how he speaks, his accents, even how he really does look, his clothes.    oh and the trip now.     We went on a whale excursion. It was nice, we saw a kind of daulphins (marsoins), little whales( Quite big enoough!!!!), bigger whales, belugas and big birds.  The dolpheny things were nice! they stood right by the boat and looked at us. We were 10 in a little zodiac, wearing those huge enormous suits, because over the st-laurence river the weather was cold, vert cold.  And even so, the weather was cold, everywhere.  We came back, And now i'm mighty pissed. My parents complained that I complained to much. I just want to hit them in the face. They were the ones taking the best for them selves, making no efforts for me, smoking in my face all the time, and laughing at me.  I really do hate smokers, at least, when they smoke with no respect for others.  i just wanted to yell att them so much when they answered : Oh We're on hollydays, shut up and stay calm, give us a break, grow up, when I said that They fucking had no respect for me, what so ever. they smoke in our little motel room, waking up, which woke me up, geving me a huge headach, and throathach, in the car, both at the same time, in the restaurent, in my face while i was eating.  SO FUCK THEM  THEY ASK MEEEE TO GIVE THEM A BREAK BECAUSE I JUST ASKED THEM TO BE MORE CAREFULL AS FOR THE WAY THEY SMOKE!! I fucking hate them.  they're so unconcious.  I hate cigarette so much, it's breaking my familly appart. literaly. I never pseak to my parenyts, because they're smoking, and when I am in the same room asthen and they smoke (only if obligated), then i will yell at them because theyll yell at me because i asked them not to smoke.  fuck.... do you people realise, how stupide it is.  I ask them not to smoke, because IT'S BOTHERING ME, they're the ones who make me fucking hold my breath, bend so i can get some air, they're the one giving me headaches, and because I ask them not to do so, I should stop because it's bothering them!!!!    FUCKING NOT RESPECTFULL PEOPLE.  i hate them, i'm so much in fury.   at least they bought me a modern greek book, but it cost 2 bucks.  and I saw swedish people for the first time in quebec few hours ago.   I miss my friends, and I don't want to go to skool.

      I can't get the memories out of my head.  I'll play the night all over again, it's just too exiting.  I took a shower and took my mini-disk player. I went to the busstop, where i longly waited, the sun was nice and I was dying from heat.  Then I took the bus, to the metro, and took the metro. The i arrived at my destination. I went up the designated road, which seemed to be the wrong but wasnt I remember seeing people passing by me, a bird and other people. at the corne.  then walking up the road, i finnaly saw the teater. I can remember that i was very very hot.  Since I had nothing to do really, I just entered the teatre and asked a guy at the ticketstand the time they were coming, and if they had the guest list. indeed they didnt, but then I met with a guy, maybe 34yo, dressed like a 20, whith a long board and short hair, talking to the guy i was talking seconds ago. he said that mÃºm would be late because they had problemes and they were stock in boston. so i talked to him and blablÃ¦d.  I walked out, waiter alittle bit, seeing portuguese with theyr flags waving cause they won a cup, and quebecers withtheyr flag cause it was our national day, the june 24th of 2004. i walked up to this tim horton and got a frozen capuccino, which i drank slowly, sitting and reading my icelandic book. Then, Bob, my physic teatcher passed by me and came to say hello, he was with aguy, probably his boyfriend. i drank on. Then I walked around the blocks, aimlessly, wandering in the heat.  Then i went to chek the time at the phones again, in the teatre. I walked out and went to buy a bottle of water at the very same timhorton. I walked, listening to the walkmen, down to a park where i sat down and read and ate.  then the time passed, until i went back at the teatre waiting. it must hav been 3 or 4. Then I met, Kim HiothÃ¸y, the first part of mÃºm, and a norwegien. we spoe abit, alot actualy, then he had to go. i remember he was shy and smoke a cigarette, which didnt stink at all. he was amazed by the languages i spoke, and he talked to me a little in norwegien, testing me, but i understood.  then, i went inside to wait, with the first guy that came waiting. he was teh second in line. he was from quebec and about 25, 30 yo. sylvain.  then, when many people came, at about 7, 730, i saw gunnar passing out from the fron door to outside. i fliped out! then came Ãrvar, the one who sent me the letter. so then, i ran outside and asked, with msitakes :  hÃ¦! Ã©g er maÃ°ur sem skrifaÃ° Ã¾ig um mÃ©r ekki verandi Ã¡ttan. which should have been  HÃ¦! Ã©g er sÃ¡ sem skrifaÃ° Ã¾ig um mig ekki verandi Ã¡ttan gamlan.  he said something in icelandic which i cant remember and then he explained me the probleme, which was that the staff coulndt allow me in because of alcohol. so we started walking fast till the backdoor, he led me through a room, and hid me in a loge. i could see kristin to whome i went speaking. she was eating humus and licked her finger thuroughly befor smiling, wiping it and shaking my hand we talked, me and her and Ã³lÃ¶f, the other girl. they spoke in icelandic and i had abit of troublle answering, buit still i spoke. they asked me how long i had been learning icelandic.  Then we sit down, i ate alot, i was hungry, and we talked, wetalked and we talked alot. there was Ãrvar, gunni Ã³lÃ¶f kristÃ­n, eiki the guy I cant remember his name, DAMN. but he isnt in the band officialy. and there was the manager.  then when they started preparing for the show, i went looking at them practicing, according their instruments. i can vividly remember the drummer doing the beat for "Nightly cares" which is one of the bvest song on the album, and the drum was SO good, so full of ambience, just in those few percutions.  Then we talked more, sitting in the couche, i saw Ã³lÃ¶f walking out of the shower, stretching like in a summercamp.  Then came teh moment of the first act, with kim , which was there. he was glad i made it in. i mostly spoke with Ã³lÃ¶f, eiki and Ã¶rvar. kristin and gunni where shy.  kim played his act, it reallyt was good. i really got into the images his music could send. all the lng 4 songs were good. he was jumping on stage, moving his red haired head. it was really nice. I came in back stage again, telling him how good he was. then it was allready mÃºm's time. I asked kim for a pill, because i had a terrible back ache. he gave me those ultra, overwelmingly powerfull pills, that he slip in two, because i't's just to power full. i took a glass of water, put the thing in it and drank the bublely liquid. it tasted awfull, but he encouraged me, saying, drink it like a man etienne, comon! which made me laugh more than anything, which isnt good while drinking.  So the show begane. I used the stage to go get my place in the first row. I was standing and using the stage as an accotoir. i made the longest eye contact with Ã³lÃ¶f, sometimes ending in inapropriate smiles, during the sad songs. I also yelled a few things bwteen the songs, and even asked something to kristin while she was on the scene. but since i was right under her, i could easely talk to her if she bent a little.  the show was allready over. I wont describe theyr music, listen your self. I came in and only said it was the greatest, and didnt talk to them again aout their music. it is far to personal, for me to share it with them. i would be shy about it.  we sat down, they drank some beer and lit up a joint. i was abit shoked, but what the heck. we talked and chitchated. the show musthave ended at like 11h, 11h30. we talked until 1'o clock. and i was with them staring from 7.30 til 1'o clock.  when came time to go, i was sad. I knew the time was slipping, but i had to go, even though this was the best thing in the world.  i remember the couche, the kind of underground feel the room gave, them asking each other questions as to what they were doing at 15, since i was 15 andthey thought it was funny that i hang out in backstage shows.  it was raining alot. they all offered me a taxi, but i had to say no, they had been to nice with me allready.  so kim offered me a box to protect me form the water. I went out and said thank you, alot. I walked out of theteither, under the pooring rain, seeing the bus right beside, and that kristin and Ã³lÃ¶f where in it, i went and knocked at the door to thank them and say byebye. i did and Ã³lÃ¶f was very nice.  i ran down the street with so much water pooring on me i was super wet, even iwth a cardboardbox on my head.  i walked home and met someone i knew in the bus.  oh by the way,  i quite the studio for no perticular reason, no ellements made me go at that very moment when i did, but i arrived one minute befor the last bus departed. that is luck.  i went home, listened to mÃºm, and took great care of the cd they gave me, plus the otographied vynil.  i was tired, but it was the best night in the world. i never wanted it to end.  but it did.  i'm so anxious about their next venue. I hope ill meet them again. i couldnt stand it, not meeting them.    anyways..  this now breaks my new record for LONGEST BLOG    good night.  i love mÃºm  takk mÃºm, Ã¾akka ykkar kÃ¦rlega fyrir.

      I'm ON FIRE!  i've just written an other 8 pages!  DAH! But I have to say, one of them wasn't creation, but just writting the verb to be, comletely.  I am : egos I was : estos [there may one see the link with indo eauropean languages] [and here is all regular] I have been : esona I had been [before something happened] : esonas I were [if i were, I would be] : egon I had been [if I had been, past of what is up there] : eson I might be : egosa I might become : eÄosa [ eghosa]  and look at this irregular form. It simply is a natural fact that created it, called elusion and labial weakness. This means that the word had a h, or a v, and they blent together.  it means, It will have been : Ã«ve [eÃ¯ve] The reason for it to have a -v when the stem is a -g, is that the -g sheldom becomes -h, and here was the case. The real form was thus ehive. It became evive since there was a -v and the stressed vowel, the -h assimilited it's self to its neighboor. And then the evive became eive, because the -v's are rather weak when unstressed, and here eV was unstressed. and Eive can also be written Ã«ve, and Ã«ve is the correct.  I find it so crazy that a g became a -v by a totaly natural and in contexte, considered normal prosesus.   I'M IN FIRE I SAY My might is high.  Egos um! I am good!

      I'm reading this 185 years old book about ancient greek and i'm getting a hold on it. .  It's hard, the verbs, but it's so very very interesting, and I really just ador the reduplication.  Reduplication is something used in the perfect tense of verbs.  I don't know many verbs, but let's say TÃO, which means to honor. i honor would be : tÃ­Ã³ [ÏÎ¯Ï] i honored would be : Ã©tion [Î­ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½] and here is hwat is cool.  i have honoured is : tÃ©tika [ÏÎ­ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ±]  Anyways, this makes greek really cool.    2.  HEROES by david bowie, remixed by Aphex Twin, IS SUCH a cool song. I really like it, it reminds me of craziness, i wish that would in my mind if i were ever to become crazisch.

      I am extenuated, dead, tiiiired. Yesterday I went to sleep at midnight right after I had finshed writting the 7th official page of my Glossopoiesis of the 1st of august, but I had written much more than that.  Officialy, yesterday I wrote more than 14 pages, in one day... I had so much inspiration coming from my readings about greek.  I just hope I wont read what I wrote in a few days, when it'lll be out of my head, and realise that it can not be because of some silly mistake.  Just to show the might of my genius, here is the declensions for the masculine, all the three declensions (feminin has 3 and neutral 2, which makes 7 declensions, and more patterns related to phonetical morphings)  Masculine First declension  Magar ~ City 1. magar (nom) 2. magan (acc) 3. magal (prep) 4. magle (gen) 5. maglen (ill) 6. magel (abl) 7. magles (ess) 8.

MettÃ¥ (voc)  The reason why the word Meita becomes Metta, is that there can not be a diphtongue infront of an âh, and since double âp âd ât âb âg âk âr are considered breathy doubles, meaning that they are pronounced as if an âh was placed befor them (-hp, -hd, -ht, -hb, -hg, -hk, -hr[Å]).  As for Mesai instead of Meisai, the reason for the shortning of the vowel is that, there may not be two diphtongues on after the other in such a way ( D-C-D ). And since the conbination in Meissai is (D-C-C-D), then it is possible, but even then it is not pronounced as written, but rather [messai].

Upe (voc)   Seccond declension ( ending in consonant )  Svor ~ language 1. svor (nom) 2. spor (acc) 3. sor (prep) 4. sora (gen) 5. soraÃ° (ill) 6. sar (abl) 7. soras(ess) 8.

Svor (voc)  The letters âp âb âf âv âd âl âr may not be doubled in final possitions, they are simply left simple, unless a vowel goes after them.  Ah.  And indeed, the genders a very NOT aleatory, because a gender is determinated by the letter whithin the word, that is graded. Graded means that the consonant is changed into an other one, with allways staying in the same "kind" of consonant.  The best exemple would be : the letter "t"  There are two main gradations, the higher and lower. It means that one will make the consoannt change into an higher one in the moouth (highest being p, and lowest g)  noraml : t graded high : Ã° (th, which is higher than t, if you try to make the comparaison) graded low : s (lower, if you try) The high's are neutral and mix, the middle are feminin and the low are masculine.  This means, that  Etienne  would be feminine, from the fact that it is T the highest consonant and that it is allways the highest that gets graded, and never the starting consonant.  .  So thats what I did yesterday...  interesting,    ISN'T IT?

      I am busy right now with my project, Glossopoiesis, and I'm reading about ancient greek, so I won't be writting so much on here.  Well being here, I'll say some stuff. It's hot, hot hot.  The weather will be hot hot hot, with 100% chances of, Passion! (the simpsons, to be said with an gay hispanic accent)  I don't do much socialy these days. I wen't at karine's place and we wached Mystic river. It wasn't as good as it was supose to be, and I couldn't stop looking at SÃ©an peen's face, being really weird. It was nice, but... abit pretexterial.  Then I went sleeping at gailer's place, and we had to get there by bikes, at 10:30pm, with abnormaly big raining, but fortunatly it was very warm, so we were completely wet, but warm.  I really like the word warm.  warmmmmm, waaarrrm. [oaÅm]  And my brother keeps saying that blogging is disgusting, and that no one reads me, and it's useless and losserly.  But, he's ugly, and you know what they say about ugly big brothers, they're wrong.  So he is.  Anyways it's fun, it's like an archive of what I did, so I can rememvber.  I never do remember what I did, and whith whome, as Mylene can tell you.   Ã¾aÃ° er nÃº Ã¾aÃ°.
