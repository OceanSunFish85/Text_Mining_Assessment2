      The truth is tearing up my heart, I can't recognize this place, the endless road without a stop sign, cant even find a stranger this time, why am i still holding back my tears, in this loneliness there's nothing to fear, every chord still seems so wonder, how we could be together, everytime i ask if this would be the last, why am i still talking to myself, hoping you will have the keys to my cell, every song might calm the weather, but it just draws me deeper, how do i get out of this, i think i never will... a crystal forming in the eye, maybe THIS will be the last, the winding path down my face, till i begin to taste the bitterness inside.........   (no.....i realli taste happiness wif u in the past)
