      Yes, a very depressing title to yet another amazing song yet puts u in that mood where u start thinking bout things and well i guess thats good n a way...but ya =this is gonna probably not be the most uplifting blog out of em all cuz im writing to that song...theres this one line that says O HOW time has FLOWN...and well it has...i have such a short time on earth....i just realized that ive already lived 1/5 of my life,  20%(according to statistics)...thats alot of my life already GONE...and well its been fun but dude its not long at all down here...and man i really dont know what i would do if i wasnt a christian and didnt believe in God...there just wouldnt be any purpose...at all...Sometimes we get wrapped up in crud that really wont matter later on...and i say we cuz i do too...and it really doesnt so why do we do it...cuz we are human and we are blinded by THE TEMPORARY...sadly tons of people will be blinded until their death.........man i was listening to The radio today and this Expert guy or whatever was talking about all the Attack threats on a america n crud and i was like uh Oh...he said that he would be very suprised if there wasnt a nuclear bomb exploded on US soil within the next 3 years... and i was like wow my dads a conspirasist...he'll probably make us move to IDAHO!!!no just kidding but seriously that didnt make me too happy and ya they were sayin that NEW YORK CITY was probably the main target...and they were saying if it got hit...the worlds economy would PLUMMET and that we would likely go into a depression again and the STock market would just be GONE and ya not good stuff........so ya i would really be worried about all that stuff but i know ultimately God is in Control and he wouldnt let anything happen to me or anyone else who is his...so i hold onto that...and that keeps that FROWN UPSIDE DOWN or however that goes... so ya i guess basically the main message here is...BE HAPPY!.................o by the way we beat oakridge by 18 in BBALL...anyways where was i...o ya.................

      Today i officially declared war on my phone...i decided to switch phone covers....just for a change you know...nothing too drastic or anything...so i finally get around to switching the covers cuz it takes like 2 minutes to do it...so i start and well most phones you can just slide on the covers or snap em on...nooo you have to unscrew these 6 screws to get it off and to switch it...so im looking for the right screwdriver to switch these lil buddies up and ya none of em fit...so i get frustrated and my dad later on tells me u have to buy a special screwdriver for thosethings....So ya i was like OF COURSE...they couldnt of made it simple but anyways he goes out buys the screwdriver and i get to unscrewing...and i get em off and switch covers and i put the phone cover back on...and im like ok that wasnt too bad...so i call my friend cuz he called me earlier and then i realize he picked up but there was no sound and he couldnt hear me either...so im like hmmm this is gay...so i soon find out theres a microphone and a speaker that u have to take off the old one and reattach it!!!So by this point ive unscrewed the thing 5 times and im on edge a little bit...but not wavered by the mounting pressure...i kept my cool...so i continue to attach the speaker and MIKE and then i screw the thing back on only to find out that THE MIKE was put in backwards so it didnt work...so now im like aight this is the LAST STRAW...so i take it off turn the MIKE around and its all set...so i screw it all on AGAIN and im like this is it...its complete...AAAAANo the stupid phone wouldnt turn on...the battery was FULL!! yet when i pressed ON it wouldnt come on...just blackness...so man im killin rite now...so i storm off and scream and just go around dissin the phone and how homosexual it is...and then i finally decide to touch it again and dismantle the whole thing and start from scratch...i made sure everthing was perfect...no dust...no blood...no scratches...i was clear so i moved in and put it togetha and well it worked...so ya i dont know... me n my phone... we arent real tight right now...whenever i answer it...if i do...i hold it away from my head so i can touch it as little as possible...but i think we'll work it out somehow...if not, its all good... ill just buy a cingular or verizone phone...(this whole thing reminds me of 2 people somehow...)anyways the whole thing took about an hour n a half outta my day...so ya phones are gay...

      Ya i dont know if these is going to be a recurring trend...but ive had 2 different days already with 2 posts each on em...so i guess we'll find out if it stays this way...anyways call me a girl call me sappy call me w/e...but it hit me as i was driving home tonight...i was like...man i am alone...so i was like man i  wish i had a girlfriend...and then i started thinking of all the girls who i could see my self with...and really i was suprised cuz it was more than 3...hmmm....ya anyways and then i thought how this special girl would make me feel important and umm not alone...and then i was like well then she'll dump me or id dump her and then aloneness sets in again...not saying girlfriends are bad At All and they dont always end up bad either but ya moving on and then i lookd up and i saw the moon...or a sliver of it... and then i looked at the sky and how vast and HUGEE it looked in comparison to that sliver of the moon...and i was like man thats how i feel right now...unimportant, insignificant, and small...i mean in comparison to it all...everything that is going on in the world...what do i have to offer??? what do i matter...and i was all down and then i guess it was God b/c then he was like dude but u know me? i made all that stuff...and well you know me on first name basis...and i was like whoa dude  thats right... and then he was like dude i love you more than anyone on this planet could ever love you... well wait he didnt say dude but ya...and that hit me pretty hard cuz i kinda forget that ALOTT of the time...but ya that helped me cope with that lonely moment...i think every one in this world strives to be loved...people need to feel needed i guess...i mean i dont know if anyone could survive without love...love is what makes the world go round...so cliche...so true...so overused...still true...so ya thats my sappy...already been said...yet needed to say it BLOG for the year...might be more...who knows? who cares?...probably no one...I FEEL SO UNLOVED....ahhh WHERE IS THE LOVE...haha no jk...but seriously...

      Dont ever try to please someone if its gonna change who you are...its not worth it...you'll end up questioning yourself and most of the time the person won't even like you because they didnt like you for who you really were... so ya thats it(i bet everyone has said that once in their life...o well) BE WHO YOU ARE!! MAN im crying rite now...no not really but i would if i could..or if   i   wanted to??? i dont know it just seems to me that a lotta people rite now are doing that sort of thing...but o well... its high school...so i guess all that this blog really means is, is that im single and im lovin' it.........well not really lovin it but not hatin ya know...cuz there are definitely too many hatas' in this world...i think every one will agree with me on that one...but ya i just need someone to TURN UP THE HEAT!...or something...OR FREEZE ME...nothing in between...dont want that lukewarm stuff...ya...but i guess thats upo to GOD...and well....thats fine...
