      Gaurav and I spoke with Mahesh Aras regarding the inner ring issue. Mahesh was very good and kind. They started on a defensive and settled for the lee instead of the truly aspirational (I think).

      Try and understand why some believe that 'restricted stock' is better than 'stock options'...What's the underwater hue...?

      There has been a frantic amount of action on the search engine front with Overture, Altavista,Alltheweb,Inktomi,Yahoo and others eating each other. Whither is Google in all this? And why?  Probably because it faces no threat and it has super algorithm capabilities backing its engines. There is no point buying a lousy search engine, obviously.

      Kissinger believed that the "market-China" supercedes all other arguments and Taiwan should eventually merge with China. TWN became a democracy in 2000 after years of autocratic rule....  Impact of politics and the position of China and US on the unification matter is  very  crucial. No matter what the deal.

      Sam is IBM_CEO after Gerstener and makes Lotus Sametime that I have been trying to use for sometime now. How he belives it's always 'client'and not 'customer' as the former brings lifetime revenues and not-off. More reading makes it seem as though the society is largely 'information based'.

      Some guys here are contemplating leaving and are quite convinced of the baseness of work that goes on here. I see their point buy believe that there is scope to impress the goodness upon people who matter.

      Google has 20.7 million stock options outstanding at an exercise price of US$5.21. The stock is expected to debut between US$108-135.  About 50% of the stocks are fully vested (check this..) So they can be instantly cashed

      Aware that India's Rs 22,500 crore retailing industry was galloping at an unbelievable pace (grew by 25 percent last year), Reliance had to go for it. Incidentally, there are estimated 4.3 million retail outlets, of which the organised sector accounts for less than 2 percent only!  Shall we say move over WalMart or J.C. Penney, here comes the Indian juggernaut: Reliance.Shopping malls and hyper malls and what not, all over the country, is what Reliance has up its sleeves, though the company is yet to reveal all.While the Indian consumer is just started releasing his money bags, very evident in the fact that malls and shopping plazas opening by the hour literally, catering not just to mid to high-end customers but also to the mass market, would be Relianceâs aim at providing consumers a complete shopping experience.  With retail petrol pumps, Reliance Infocom shops and now, hyper malls and super markets, the next one year will see the company fighting and biting in to the market share of the likes of Arvind Brands, Raymonds, Madura, S Kumarâs and others even as Walmart and their ilk plan launches in India, savoring on Indian consumers while treating them as Kings  Queens.

      Here's some DIlbert GYAAN.. Please appreciate and applaud.. &gt; 1. I can only please one person per day. Today is &gt; not your day. Tomorrow is not looking good either. &gt; 2. I love deadlines. I especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go flying by. &gt; 3. Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you how to get along without it. &gt; 4. Accept that some days you are the pigeon and some days the statue. &gt; &gt; 5. Needing someone is like needing a parachute. If he isn't there the first time, chances are you won't be needing him again. &gt; &gt; 6. I DON'T HAVE AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM, YOU HAVE A &gt; PERCEPTION PROBLEM. &gt; &gt; 7. Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky, and I thought to myself, "where the heck is the ceiling?" &gt; 8. My reality cheque bounced. &gt; &gt; 9. On the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the escape key. &gt; &gt; 10. I don't suffer from stress. I am a carrier. &gt; &gt; 11. You are slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter. &gt; &gt; 12. Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, because you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup. &gt; &gt; 13. Everybody is somebody else's weirdo. &gt; &gt; 14. Never argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level, then &gt; beat you with experience. &gt; &gt; 15. A pat on the back is only a few inches from a kick in the butt. &gt; &gt; 16. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be &gt; promoted. &gt; &gt; 17. After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the month than you did before. &gt; &gt; 18. The more crap you put up with, the more crap you are going to get. &gt; &gt; 19. You can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a &gt; clipboard. &gt; &gt; 20. Eat one live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day. &gt; &gt; 21. If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done. &gt; 22. When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried. &gt; &gt; 23. Following the rules will not get the job done. &gt; &gt; 24. When confronted by a difficult problem, you can solve it more easily by reducing it to the question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?" &gt; &gt; &gt; 25. Only the mediocre are at their best all the time. &gt; &gt; 26. There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line. &gt; &gt; 27. Bring ideas in and entertain them royally, for one of them may be the king. &gt; &gt; 28. If at first you don't succeed......skydiving isn't for you. &gt; &gt; 29. When everything is coming your way......you're in the wrong lane. &gt; &gt; 30. Those who work, get more work. Others get pay, perks, and promotions.
