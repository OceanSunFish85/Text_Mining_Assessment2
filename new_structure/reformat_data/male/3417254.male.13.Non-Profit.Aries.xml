       The concept of a "new economy" in the 21st Century stems from new wealth, once drawn predominantly from natural resources and tangible commodities, achieved through innovative ideas mediated by new mind tools, viz., technology.  The tools, of course, innovative to start -- having seduced a multitude of speculators to invest in what can only be described as abstract spaces  -- now form the basis of innovations that could not have been realized without sophisticated technologies.  Since the start of micro computing, investors have gambled on the emergent new tools, most making monumental profits.  Today, large organizations such as governments, academic institutions, and corporations are determined to uncover with certitude the key to nurture intellectual property.  If the new economy is rooted in ideas, viz., arts and sciences, those with greatest interest in capital gain seek to enrich the individual and society on the basis of harnessing creative capital.     Clearly it is a peculiar condition we live in, where the brightest minds are sought after as the new natural resource. In deference to artists and scientists alike who have not profited from creative capital in the same manner as producers and distributors, we salute you. Speculators beware -- there is no more certainty in the value of goods and services arising from hard commodities than arising from the creative mind.   Just as the Dutch in the 17th century could not have foreseen the demise of their precious tulip by a fickle public, neither can we be certain of the knowledge market.  Those who seek the best minds from which to profit will also find that, like all economic venture, minds are as unpredictable as the marketplace itself.

      When we   read, write, listen, speak , we engage the most important tools for shaping the mind.  Newer  mind tools   (i.e., new media) have been developed over the past twenty years, drawing us into the New Economy where creative capital is edging out traditional economies.  The birth of the Blog is like a Kerouac journey that everyone who wishes may actively participate in creating!

      Brilliant! I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an "aha" moment! Deductive logic (âItâs elementary my dear Watsonâ) brings fruitful ends! Science as a âway of knowing and doingâ is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the "time delay" between the second you hit "publish post" and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is âinappropriate,â Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they may wish to censor or delete comments before they are published.      I recommend saving your comments in a word document in the event your posting is inadvertently erased.

       I just have a string of thoughts from today...more paradoxesâ¦   I wonder what is meant when children speak of learning that is "real" rather than âfake.â The  urlLink  24 Hour Film Contest   felt very "real" to the students at Newton Learning Center. When pupils speak of "fake," what does that mean? What is the difference between "academic" literacy vs. "practical" literacy?  Is there such a thing as practical literacy (or is that called functional literacy)? For that matter what do we mean when teachers are admonished to make learning âmeaningfulâ and connected to ârealâ life? Take the performing arts for instance, meaningful to me but not considered a ârealâ profession â worse, as my eldest daughter continues to seek the stage (aspiring actor), all I can hear in my head is â âget a real job.â  Hmmm.     So what do we make of literacy?  Into what has the term "literacy" evolved since the time of the Gutenberg Press?  In the beginning it meant to be "alphabetized" (the term used in French), and we acknowledge that mass literacy has been a key to the past 400 years of evolution in science, math, technology, economics, industry and so on.  Now we speak of multiple literacies but what does that mean?  Does it mean âliteracyâ that goes well beyond "written text" the staple of the past 400 years of mass Western âliteracy?â  What do the âexpertsâ say?     Anywayâ¦to be highly âliterateâ in our Canadian society is valued because of the link between the highly literate and the highly innovative. Yet in what sense do we mean âhighly literate,â academic, practical, specialized (i.e., field-related), generalized?  Which form of literacy leads to the brightest minds (and I might add honed and focused athletes)? If this is our new âcall to armsâ for teachers in the 21st centuryâ¦how will we get there?  What do we do with the minds that will never shine because of genetic barriers?  Moreover, what do we do with all of the âsocialâ problems that make âliteracyâ issues trail in the dust?  Or is this somehow all related?  Hmmm...and the beat goes on...and the beat goes on...la di da di da...la di da di da...

       First day of class!  What an extraordinary group of individuals!  Each person, expressing so many interesting viewpoints from diverse contexts, contributed to a look at the fascinating paradoxes in education.  Can we connect some of the themes?  Go to the  urlLink  on-line textbook   to view the first link called âContext.â  You can surf the four topics,   gender, age, multicultural, language,   to uncover what language theorists are saying about literacy.     Here is what I wonder.  If spoken word is such a vital part of our linguistic heritage and given that we are such social beings (Vygotsky), why does our teaching in the 21st Century continue to be so didactic â so 19th Century?   According to statistics, the ratio between teacher and pupil talk shows that teachers are relentless in doing most of the talking!  That does not sound very sociable (would we expect a party host to do   all   the talking?) neither does it seem opportune since communication appears to be unidirectional! How droll is that?     A few of the following themes that arose from our introductions may lead us to unraveling the paradoxes:  (1) cultural attitudes and values (including parental, teen, administrative, teacher, government), (2) the teacher identity and sense of belonging crisis that ensues from questions like, âWhy am I not taken seriously or valued?â â âWhat am I/they doing here?â â âWhat am I doing this for?â â âDo I make any difference?â â âWhy is the system so slow to change?â â "What is the meaning of life?"     Okayâ¦so that last question is a bit too unwieldy. Still it holds a peculiar significance in the world of literacy insofar as what we value and the language we use are inexorably linked.  You most likely empathized, as I did, with a number of concerns that were voiced â and found some to be even more personally relevant than others.  Yet, despite the numerous subject areas, patterns were evident.  And there was an interesting undercurrent â a âgroundâ as it were â that may recede from our immediate view but that somehow connects all of these issues (i.e., âfiguresâ). What are your thoughts?

        "I guess I still havenât been able to shake off the anesthetic of suburbia.  And real life.  Because the anesthetic of suburbia also involves having three parentsâa mother, a father and a TV set.  Two of them are equilibriums, but one of them is more powerful because itâs always new and fresh and entertaining.  It doesnât reach out and tell you what to do" (Steven Spielberg in Rolling Stone Magazine, July 1982).    Some of you may know the story of Steven Spielbergâs start in the film industry before  Jaws  made him a name.  At the age of 17, on a tour of Universal Studios, sneaking away to a sound stage, he eventually talked his way into obtaining a visitorâs pass that turned into a summer of âsquattingâ in an abandoned office and hobnobbing with producers and writers. His small filmmaking trials (with 8mm film)  and his abundant knowledge of the medium propelled his imagination and audacity.  In the end, that âchutzpahâ led to his eventual success.  Here then is a âself-taughtâ filmmaker â yet to what degree was he taught through the medium itself?  Through a watchful eye and an amateur lens, he gained knowledge as he journeyed with media âmentorsâ (both machine and human). Quentin Tarantino, as the story goes, never learned the language of film production, and continues to invent words on a regular basis.  His film crews have learned to figure out his intent whenever he defies the use of conventional terms.  His accomplishments (like him or not) display another âself-taughtâ filmmaker.  Like Spielberg, his media literacy began while watching TV and countless movies (from martial arts to Westerns).    Over the past two days, we watched the opening of  Altered States  and  2001: A Space Odyssey   as well as a 30 second short with sci-fi overtones made by a third grader.  Perhaps science fictions may begin scientific discourse or perhaps they are merely precursors to movie making.  Either way, one cannot help to notice the inevitable debate that ensues from such starting points â from medium (Is the book/text or the movie/visuals/sound better?) to message (What does it mean? Is it truth or fiction?).     More questionsâ¦  Can we deepen discourse in science, social studies, math, artâ¦etcâ¦through stories found in movies, music, poetry, art   and   books? Do movies or TV have a place in our classrooms? Should we teach the skills of the medium by  analyzing  films or   making   films or both?  Did your iMovie experience demystify the medium of movies?  What of Shaunâs powerful thought under âNew Economyâ post?  Does any of this matter?

      There is an ancient maxim that states, âTeach them correct principles and they will govern themselves.â  While this adage is devoted primarily to moral and ethical principles, it may be applied beyond.  Another similar axiom states, âFeed a man a fish, and he will eat for a day, teach him to fish and he will feed for a lifetime.â  Both adages are rooted in the notion of the existence of âuniversalâ truths that intersect all knowledge (e.g., the scientific process as means to solve problems). Individuals who acquire skills and knowledge (i.e., become literate) begin to âsee the whole schemaâ and âknow how to navigate its system.â In the end, those individuals are âset freeâ or rather released from âexternal governanceâ exercising âfree willâ within the confines of culture and society. Anyone who labors to instruct seeks to help individuals locate the âinner locus of control,â i.e., the will to learn.  Thus, teaching is as much a matter of tapping into the interest and  natural  ability of a learner and deepening their knowledge as a means to engage their  will  to learn as it is a matter of broadening their horizons.    According to  urlLink  John Taylor Gatto (go to article),  schooling merely âdumbs downâ human potential by keeping individuals from âgrowing up.â  Hmmmâ¦Critics of education find it easier to disparage schooling practices than to find solutionsâ¦    First, though, we must wake up to what our schools really are: laboratories of experimentation on young minds, drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands. Mandatory education serves children only incidentally; its real purpose is to turn them into servants. Don't let your own have their childhoods extended, not even for a day. If David Farragut could take command of a captured British warship as a pre-teen, if Thomas Edison could publish a broadsheet at the age of twelve, if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a printer at the same age (then put himself through a course of study that would choke a Yale senior today), there's no telling what your own kids could do. After a long life, and thirty years in the public school trenches, I've concluded that genius is as common as dirt. We suppress our genius only because we haven't yet figured out how to manage a population of educated men and women.  The solution, I think, is simple and glorious. Let them manage themselves. (Harper's, Sept 2003)

      How timely!  A good friend has sent me the link to an extraordinary gathering of thoughts for the 40th anniversary of McLuhanâs seminal work that began with the most provocative aphorism ever to strike our inquisitive minds on the topic of new media, âThe medium is the message.â (Also, âThe medium is the massage.â A playful turn of phrase demonstrating McLuhanâs penchant for language.)      Forty Years of Understanding Media: A Symposium  At the 2004 Social Sciences and Humanities Federation Academic Congress at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, on June 4th, 12:30 -  2 PM, The McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto and the McLuhan Global Research Network, in partnership with the Association of Media Ecologists North, InSounds McLuhan Oral history project, and other interested participants, will celebrate the 40th anniversary of publication of Understanding Media: The extensions of man.  urlLink more    urlLink  Read book on-line

      So far, as youâve probably noticed, Iâve done the typical bloggity-blog thing that comes from public forums.  You know â raise questions, throw in a quote here and there â the usual academic fare.  And you have commented quite interestingly. But!  I just had one of those âOh noâ moments the second I opened my email.  I had shared with other instructors that I had started a BLOG with our class as a forum for discussion (different from but similar to personal journals, free writes, or classroom dialogue). Not because I think itâs the newest trend but because I wanted another means to âhearâ your thoughts â other than, yet again, more reflections. When one of the instructors sent us the link to  urlLink  Blogging Across the Curriculum,   I was taken completely by surprise that there is now a body of research in education on BLOGS!  I donât know why I was surprised, come to think of it.  Afterall, underground phenomena always become part of collective consciousness in todayâs cyber fast age â think of techno music and raves.  Sometime in the middle of my teaching career, I remember the cynicism I had felt toward journaling and portfolios being made into requisite activities and shaping the content of educational conferences!  Conferences held on the value of journaling and portfolios in education?  Two forms of expression rooted in the world of scientists and artists alike   for very, very good reason   â only to suddenly make its way into academic study and into the âcurriculumâ â or worse (shudder) IRPâs (Integrated Resource Packages).  Even the title âBlogging across the Curriculumâ makes the hairs on my arm stand up.  Itâs NOT a pedagogical method, a theory, nor an approach! Itâs just another medium.  If it works, it not only has transformed traditional ways of expressing ideas through digital means, but it will morph into an entirely different knowledge source.  If it doesnât work, it has probably been theorized to the point that no one wants any part of it anymore.  That is precisely what turned Einstein off of mathematics for years!       "It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulations, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.  It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty"(Einstein).   Okay enough ranting!  So what do you think of the relationship between technology and creativity?  What of Garageband and iMovie?  What about Peterâs question of whether todayâs music production is âcompositionâ or âarrangement?â  What about the assertion that   language   itself is a  technology ?   FÃ©lix Nadar said that he became a photographer because he was a lousy painterâ¦   "Photography is a wonderful discovery, a science which occupies the most intelligent, an art which sharpens the minds of the shrewdest, and which can be practiced by the most stupidâ¦  The theory of photography can be learned in one hour; the first notions of its practice in one dayâ¦  But I will tell you what cannot be learned: it is a feeling for light, an artistic appreciation of the effects produced by different and composite days, it is the application of one or the other of such effects according to the nature of the physiognomies which you, as an artist, have to reproduce.  What can be learned even less is the moral intelligence of your subject, that rapid tact which puts you in communication with your model, which helps you judge him and guide you through his habits and ideas, depending on his character.  This is what enables you to produce, not the banal, haphazard and indifferent plastic reproduction that is within the reach of even a laboratory technician, but a more familiar and flattering resemblance, an intimate portrait.  This is the psychological aspect of photography, and in my opinion this term is not over ambitious" (FÃ©lix Nadar).

      Leibniz once said, "Necessary truths, on the other hand, are founded upon the principle of contradiction." I like Leibniz.  At least in his thoughts I find some of my own.  The educational tensions we experience may stem more from the contradiction of being human as much as contradictions in pedagogy and  urlLink curriculum . It seems reasonable that we should inquire as to what makes learning real to students.  Just as it seems reasonable that we try to make ourselves "real" to learners rather than "fake." Whatever may be the criteria for "realness," we sense that this matter is important.    Oddly, as educators we spend an interminable amount of time questing to understand knowledge (a philosophical branch called  urlLink  epistemology  ) but mostly shy away from  urlLink  metaphysics   (the branch of philosophy that grapples with matters of reality). Yet, the matter of "realness" versus "fakeness" continues to sneak up on us as it has through the ages from pre-Socratic times right up until the Wachowski brothers, who captured our imagination momentarily with the first   Matrix  installment.  Philosophers, artists, and scientists have been toying with "reality" for the better part of the 20th Century and any  uncertainty  (Heisenberg) suggested by scientists can provoke peers to cry out, "God does not play dice" (Einstein)!  It appears that contradictions are inevitable especially whenever a practical application is attempted.  Even when we give credence to the existentialist ideal that reality is merely  point of view , arguments never cease!  In general, scientists accept truth by consensus (more so than artists and philosophers?), for as long as skepticism exists and testing persists, there will always remain "checks and balances."  The trouble with philosophy and art, of course, lies in the fact that "proof" is achieved through rational thought (i.e.,  a priori ).  Not easy to argue by  logic  alone!  Why anyone chooses to investigate problems that are insoluble has always puzzled the pragmatist (sometimes referred to as the "practical" thinker).  The pragmatist, according to William James, is likely to "turn his back resolutely and once for all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers away from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions from bad  a priori  reasons."  Should we wonder that American ideology was founded upon Pragmatists, particularly the educational system, since capitalism necessarily requires practical means?  Ah! Ideally, life ought to afford humans time enough for both philosophical musings and practical applications (if one so desires).  It takes pragmatism to navigate daily life, to find a companion, to raise children, to labor and to survive.  On the other hand, it takes a lifetime of contemplation to fall in love, to create art, to be curious about the world and to venture into the unknown.   PS I suspect that we have all practiced the art of  being real   or  faking it , at one time or another...(Nieminen vs Lecavalier anyone?)

      As much as instructors of all sorts cherish some kind of learning text (e.g., textbook, manual, video) to provide a framework for knowledge, are there people who actually   read the manual  ?  Itâs true, Iâm a reading glutton, and Iâll read anything! Product labels are especially fun â in particular when misspellings create great humor.  E.g., for all you Francophones, I recently bought bouillon cubes that gave the following instructions.  âPour un couillon instantaneâ¦!!â  That is just too rude!!  Anyway, I have been known to read a textbook (although I have yet to read a computer manual). Like everyone else, I skim for salient points and then I construct my understanding based on headings and summaries.  By and large, knowledge rises from reading meatier texts (such as the books you are reading this term) to engage the mind/soul (though by âtextâ I also refer to all multi-genre or multi-media forms also known as multiple sign systems).  Once Iâve engaged the mind, I talk (a lot) to like-minded and non like-minded persons, I write â thoughts, poetry, and snippets of prose â I research and investigate, I dance, play music, and sometimes sketchâ¦all to engage the senses.  Finally, when the two, mind and body have sufficiently been stimulated, I feel like Iâm on my way to becoming literate in the field.  With enough practice, I may even become fluent.  One kind of  textbook  that may differ from all others is an on-line textbook or manual.  (Did you know that there is a pre-service teacher this past term who did her practicum   on-line ?)  While Iâve been actively using on-line language tutorials to learn php, or html â or simply going straight to the âhow-toâ sections of learning sites â something that was âtransparentâ to me was just made very visible today.  The interesting point that one of the other instructors (Kedrick James) mentioned in our meeting was the unusual capacity that hypertext may play in creating a âgangliaâ of knowledge â where a nucleus (i.e., question) exists without the usual âendâ in sight (i.e., answer).   When surfing through the excellent textbook source found on line called  urlLink  Language Across the Curriculum,   we find a very good place to begin the understanding of the importance language and (multi) literacy plays within every discipline.  To attempt to âgraspâ through a single course of study (i.e., LLED 301) or textbook the breadth of the meaning of literacy, the role that forms of language and media play in education, and the techniques that may be utilized to build competency, may be more than one can reasonably achieve in short order!    Nevertheless, surfing an on-line âtextâ (especially when one is asking questions) offers something entirely unique.  What if, for every foreign word we were to come across in any given âtext,â a link took you to yet another site that explained the term (historically, semantically, etymologically)?  Or a researcherâs name is mentioned  urlLink  (i.e., Vygotsky),  or a body of research  urlLink  (i.e., Semiotics)  ?  In other words, what would a story or textbook enable if hyperlinks were to carry the ânarrativeâ from one point of reference to another?   In the on-line textbook under the heading called  urlLink  Context,   there are four subheadings, each contributing knowledge and skills for teachers across discipline areas.  Of the four distinct areas, Gender, Age, Multi-cultural, and  urlLink  Use of language,   I was particularly interested in the notion that specialized vocabulary often creates a barrier for understanding key concepts.  I certainly encounter specialized language each time I try to teach music skills to non-musicians.  The barrier that the language holds often seems insurmountable, for each special term (while resembling common usage, such as âbeatâ or ârhythmâ) creates an impasse for the learner.  It is only when learners experience the language through  listening to  and  making  music that the vocabulary no longer guards its secrets.  I was also interested in the heading  urlLink  Reading Strategies   where three key questions are explored, namely, Why teach reading?  What is reading?  How can I tell if my student has a reading difficulty? As well, one finds  urlLink  strategies for reading   and  urlLink  on-line resources   for reading.  Another excellent section called  urlLink Grammar   contains a succinct history of the English language! All of these wonderful bits of information are a handy source of knowledgeâ¦neverthelessâ¦  A few last thoughts continue to drift in and out of consciousness.   How will the use of hyperlinks affect the regular "reading of a text?"  I remember when someone came up with the idea for DVDs to contain pop ups that you could click on, which would take you instantly to the directorâs POV or some such info source.  I tried one and hated the "interruptions" with the little pop ups (you could turn those off) right away.  I wanted the narrative in its entirety the first time round but the second time viewing was fun to click and learn.    The last thought deals with the phenomenon called the âdigital divide.â  It is no surprise that we live in a  urlLink  digital divide,   and advocacy for literacy stretches beyond âreading and writingâ  (once conceivably thought of as an âalpha-numeric divideâ). We cannot ignore social, political and economic forces, anymore than we can ignore the role we play in bringing justice to those forces in the classroom.  Each time a âteachable momentâ is missed that draws attention to the medium of words, computers and other forms of literacy, we forego the opportunity to empower children with the most basic of tools.  And thatâs what words (ostensibly technologies) can do.  Empower the individual with a voice and a way of thinking!   Did you get through this text without clicking on a link???

      Gail emailed the following thoughts that were meant as a comment to one of the postings when technology stood in her way. One way or another, I thought her words were worth posting...  GAIL SAID:  Editing is essentially the creation of reality. As a relatively prolific writer, I am too well acquainted with the editing process. I revise and revise, and revise yet again. From the "raw data," I re-arrange my text to present a completely different reality depending upon my goals for the specific written work. I want to win my academic argument, entertain my audience, or touch an emotional chord of someone close. I do so with integrity, and yet all these works present reality in a specific manner which is dependant solely upon the occasion for which I write.  Should it be any different for the filmmaker? Or for the television news editor for that matter? Do we have an expectation that it should be? Surely, Wag the Dog removed any such misguided notions. The events of the last year serve as evidence to that film's assertions; indeed, a surveillance photo of a truck or an unidentified container can be constructed into any reality, even weapons of mass destruction. The "fictitiousness" of war, as Michael Moore labeled it, became the reality with which the world now lives.  There is a fallacy that we often slip into. Seeing is believing. I myself know how text is revised, edited, altered if you will. But we seem to suffer from the notion that our eyes do not lie. Words? What are those? The print on the page has form and substance in the sense that the wood pulp of which the page consists has concrete reality, as does the black ink with which it was typeset, but words still remain intangible constructs like the ideas behind them. Vision, on the other hand, reflects the "real" world, a corporeal certainty, not a construct. Whatever our eyesight perceives surely must then be reality.  An experience like I-movie and even Garage Band, however, alters that perception. They allowed me to understand the level to which reality is presented, or distorted, through millisecond cuts, re-sequencing of events, and transitions. I discovered that music and slow motion in particular altered significantly what our movie was and what it presented versus the "reality" of the profuse raw footage. Subtle nuances oddly possess some of the greatest impact. Even if we accept that we filmed reality, what we edited, the final product surely is not. Not in its entirety.  Accepting the integrity of a Michael Moore, is Bowling for Columbine reality? Does it not have a purpose, which serves the agenda of its director/editor? What about Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will? Spielberg's Schindler's List? Or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction? How real is a black and white zoom-in on blood infused water swirling down the shower drain, a distant image of the lone little girl wandering about a Polish ghetto in a red dress, or an almost fun-house surrealism of the powerful but disillusioned man wandering down a corridor lined with mirrors which multiply his image and project it far away from us and from himself.  Nonetheless, all these images present us with some segment of one of many realities. Our job as audiences, and as teachers of students who have become consumers of these images, is to learn to read the messages, decipher the images, and re-construct them into a critical view of reality.

      I hope Dieder will forgive me for putting a link to his  urlLink  blog  without first asking permission - which is mostly his book journal - but his latest post called "Blogs hit the Web" with a link to Time Magazine is quite - well - timely!   And Sarah has also started her own  urlLink  blog  - her latest comments are responses to posts on Spord - some of you will be interested in reading.  I was thinking that an alternate assignment for the Scrapbook could have been creating your own Blog!  Dieder was able to include images (jpegs) that are either found on the web or (if you have personal server space) your own that you've stored.  I could have shown you how to do some  urlLink  simple html tags  to create links, block quotes, or to   italicize ,  bold , and  add color   ...etc.    I suppose a blog could appeal to many individuals...but then again...for some it may just seem like the same old assignment repackaged with a high tech twist... hmmm...  My practicum student, while introducing iBooks to her grade 2 class, said, "They just accomplished in an hour what took me two weeks to master!"  The students were doing a web quest - seeking images - downloading them to the desktop and inserting them into a word document in order to manipulate the image. When I polled these "savvy" 7 year olds, they informed me that they had been using computers and laptops (including wireless) since as early as the age of 2!!  Apparently TV is no longer the main competitor on our toddler's playtime...   Come to think of it, my two eldest had access to computers since they were toddlers also but the internet did not become sophisticated until they were well into their teensâ¦soâ¦the TV and the VCR were their buddies (and, later, video games like Mario Brothers). Yupâ¦I can readily admit (sheepishly)â¦as a working momâ¦I will be forever grateful to Mr. Rogers, Mr. Dressup, Rainbow Brite, Sesame Street and the countless Disney movies...(especially The Secret of Nimh)   I was using the Internet as early as 1992, but by 1995 the World Wide Web was pretty much up and running as it is today with dueling browsers (a.k.a Netscape and Explorer), and my son was 6 yrs old!  He started downloading his favorite on-line games and playing with his friends across town since he was nineâ¦  Now heâs an MSN and cell phone junkieâ¦he surfs the web regularly for funny videos/blogsâ¦he goes to a minimum of 3 movies per week (cheap theatres near home â great dating haunts for a 15 year old!) and watches "The Family Guy" and "Simpsons" on DVD â he reads voraciously (currently The Iliad) â plays Lacrosse religiously â and he was just presented with an athlete of the year award at his end-of-the-year assembly at school. While retro 60's, 70's and 80's are in...I'm afraid the 21st Century is truly his stomping ground!  I wonder what undergrads will say about technology by the time he's in university...  More things that make one say...hmmm...

        The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently. -Friedrich Nietzsche    I was particularly struck by a commentary made on Radio-Canada 97.7FM (CBC French Radio) this evening.  The commentator was quoting Carl Jung (I wish I know from which text) who purportedly said that the conundrum we face in education exists in large part because teachers who enter the profession â having been trained from within the same system they themselves were educated - know no better.  As GÃ¶del might have said, âThis is a strange loop of logic indeed.â  It is peculiar that some statements appear to be self-evident though we often overlook the profundity found within the words (hearkening back to the effects of the âtransparencyâ of words â no less due to the facility with which we use them).  Can we ignore the fact that each of us has been educated in similar educative constructs? Regardless of where we were educated or under which ideology â we have faced, to varying degrees, similar academic dysfunctions, i.e., performance excellence and competition, grading, academic achievements, standardized tests and so on.  I cringe from the idea that we are trying to teach children from within the same dysfunctional system we were once taught â but it is not easy to ignore this notion once it has been âspoken.â  And, consciously or not, perhaps that is why we collectively continue to extol the value of âreflective practice.â  There seems to be few solutions to changing oneâs perspective than by contemplation â other than to visit another universe (or crawl out of the cave).  McLuhan declared, âIf you want to know about water, donât ask the fish.â  Another fish reference â but in some ways it leads us to wonder how we may âexamineâ our existence if we do not leave âthe caveâ (as Plato so admonished us to do â this one for Gail, as have Simon de Beauvoir and Maxine Greene, both of whom expounded on the power of âimaginationâ to help us to achieve new vistas)   In other words, I think about the idea of âinstitutionalization.â  Whether that originates in a community, an organization, or a ânation stateâ â how do we venture away from the âcollective unconsciousnessâ of which Jung spoke?  We talk about curriculum constraints, and diversity within literacies that are ignored in light of cherished âreading and writingâ forms, as well as assessment and evaluation paradoxes (particularly in physical and arts education), and many more laments of education.  How do we combat that which we continue to uphold?  How do we make visible the invisible?  That is to say, render opaque what is transparent? I donât mean to act as though I understand the aphorism, âThe medium  is  the messageâ but in my mind if we only attempt to unravel the content (i.e., message) and ignore the context (i.e., medium or the âthingâ that transmits the content), we unconsciously miss what was actually âtransmitted!â   I think, in general, we focus intently on the message and neglect that the medium plays an intrinsic role in conveying that message. We have been extolled to âlistenâ to the meaning of the âwords.â  I suspect that like Dorothy, however, until we uncover the Wizard behind the Talking Head we are bound to âcowerâ from the message.  We are, at that instance, unable to uncouple the meaning of the âtextâ from the âthingâ (i.e., medium) that controls the âtext.â  It is no wonder we will say with equanimity when faced with vile rumors, âYou ought to consider the source!â But the moment that the wizardry is revealed perhaps is the moment we are empowered to uncouple the medium and the message â to examine what is communicated from all angles â and to be free to act upon what we  know .  Uncovering "the truth" (i.e., reality) for Dorothy allowed her to advocate for herself and others, forcing the Wizard to confer courage, brains and heart to her friends who possessed those qualities all along, and to find a way to return home.

      Gail Said:   Okâ¦Just like last time, I can't post the message. It keeps telling me either I'm not a member or my password isn't valid, and it won't let me go to the page where I can retrieve my password. Clearly, I am technologically challenged.    Anyway, I'm enclosing my comments.    The Power of Your Words  What power do words possess? Do they aggrandize or suppress? I considered this recently after reading Lewis Jacobs (1970)â chapter, "The Raw Material," about motion pictures as a form of creative expression. A filmmaker is a kind of artist, he asserts, like the painter, the composer, and the artist himself. He seeks to control and utilize his medium by harnessing the particular raw material of his medium in order to express his world. Regardless of the music, painting, artistic, or filmmaking medium, a man undertakes such creative endeavours in order to reveal "manâs concern with being alive." For what indeed is a man if he cannot examine his life and consider his worth and use his creative genius to express his deliberations. His deliberations and expressions are believed to be common, and the rest of us therefore can relate to him.   As a creative person who writes considerably, I could indeed connect with the concept of the vision behind expression. I have often recognized my own ability to write with a "cameraâs eye." But in reading Jacobs, I also recognized that I did not see myself represented in his words. When he speaks of the artist, the painter, and the composer, the picture that comes to mind is that of Rembrandt, Leonardo, or Beethoven. When he speaks of the visionary filmmaker, I see Coppola, Hitchcock, or Spielberg, one of whom is in fact a dead white guy. I could, of course, alter the image to ... well, some woman, Penny Marshall perhaps or Barbara Streisand, because I will assume that they, that we, are in fact included in "man."   Yet, why do I consciously need to alter the image that comes to mind when these words are read? Why must I make the effort? There were and are women artists, painters, and composers. Do I know of any? I cannot say that I do. Do I know of any women directors? Iâve named but two. No more. But I purposefully bring them to mind now because I could not see myself in the language that he uses. Where was I?   Descartes asserted, "I think therefore I am." But we cannot form a thought without language; George Orwell showed us that. If language represents but only half the population, do I think therefore I am not?  Jacobs, L. (1970).

      I like Vanessaâs closing thought, ââ¦we can do our best to please them some of the time.â  There is no doubt that teaching is a tough gig in the 21st Century â it almost seems that were we to teach in a far off place where the only resources available were a few books, we could fare much better.    We have not solved the issue of creating an âequalâ society by ensuring that all individuals achieve a level of âliteracyâ commensurate with democratic and economic rights in any nation.  Literacy, like new media, has become a âmoving targetâ and pinning it down may be perplexing.  But staying alert and trying to understand the nature or importance of language, technology, special and general knowledge, creativity â all such things that our contemporary literate world demands â may be the only way to find the bullâs eye every now and then.  Moments where learning is pleasurable!   Our world is that much more sophisticated than even a decade ago  (there are many persons to thank for the steep digital learning curve we experience today).  But in my view, Pablo couldnât have said it better â the human quality will always be at the heart of our existence (not solely machines or ideas or things)â¦humans are remarkable beings with the capacity to both triumph in love and falter in hateâ¦humans created the systemâ¦butâ¦we do not need to be slaves to our creationsâ¦  Everything today is simultaneous and now (we are in instant communication mode) and perhaps as Peter indicated slaves to âpoorâ memories and âbadâ planning as a result.  Tetrads show that the status of any medium is always happening simultaneously somewhere.  Whatever a new medium is  enhancing  somewhere, there is bound to be a  reversal into  something negative somewhere else â or that familiar thing is  obsolesced  â or the  retrieval  of yet another past artifact is ready to launch yet another enhanced extension of ourâ¦eyes, hands, ears, mouths, mindsâ¦  Where does creativity fit in all of this?  Creativity possesses many meanings (as many as there are individuals).  Its essential nature, however, is born of being uniquely human. It requires one to âseeâ what had not yet been perceived, then to communicate it in such a way that others might perceive it also.  Human beings possess the unique ability to know things  a priori  (i.e., conceptually) and to make the ideal world concrete.  For children, being creative is âseeingâ and âexpressingâ without full knowledge of its existence in specialized fields.  Creative endeavors become trickier with age and knowledge.  Do you remember as a child when the world being so enormous held endless possibilities?  As we grow older, our world becomes smaller and possibilities seem to follow suit.  It is harder to âseeâ with those same innocent eyesâ¦harder still to express ideas with innocent voices.  Yetâ¦when creativity is nourished (given time and space)â¦pathways are sure to unfold.  Just reading the whole blog againâ¦and all of the comments is enough to convince me that language is a compelling tool for creating ideas (and possibly this new technology called a blog).  And like all technologies, language may become a central force â it is a primary force for expressing the moments when we have captured the new, the unexpected, the hallucinatory, and the deliriousâ¦  For some it is the arts whose primary force captures those moments â though with language we can express with both artistry and clarity.

      GAIL SAID:  I couldn't resist responding to your "E-mail as a propaganda tool" e-mail.    Technology has, of course, been employed for propaganda for some time. The Nazis were quite adept at recognizing the power of new technologies for the purpose of propaganda and manipulated multiple technologies to disseminate their message. Radio, airplanes, and even television comprised mediums by which the Nazis successfully propagated their ideology. Modern political parties similarly employ whatever technology furthers their ends.  Computers have added a new dimension to the propaganda game through websites, newsgroups, and, following the train of advertising which is in itself a form of propaganda, those immeasurably annoying pop-up ads. Thus far, however, the use of e-mail as propaganda has seemed to consist mostly of a grassroots movement. Case in point, Anne-Marie passed on a couple of e-mails from individual citizens who took the time to express and collect like-minded political views. Although the technology of the medium itself is advanced, i.e. computers and the world wide web, the dispersal strategy is an old one: essentially chain mail. You send it to someone. And they pass it on to five friends. And so on. And so on.   How effective is a chain letter?   You tell me. Back in the "good ole days" of snail mail (for those old enough to remember them), did you ever forward a chain letter? I donât recall actually having received one, but knowing myself as I do, I likely would not have sent it on.   Do I forward chain letters that I receive now over the Internet? No. I may read them depending strictly upon the subject matter. But essentially I treat them as junk mail. They inundate my mailbox and, more significantly, consume valuable time to peruse. My "real" mail compels lengthy enough consideration and response; the burden of unsolicited information, regardless of its content, annoys me boundlessly.   To forward an e-mail or not to forward? That is not a question. My rationale for not forwarding is one of empathy: I am caught on the receiving end of this time-consumer, why on earth would I visit it upon anyone I know?   Perhaps that is why e-mail has yet to be exploited by major players in the political world as a medium for propaganda. They recognize that it has quite limited potential and hence remains a grassroots form of dispensing information. Of course, there is always bulk mailing and undoubtedly, as soon as someone figures out how to automatically forward junk e-mail to everyone in your mail box propaganda by e-mail will reach its saturation point.

      I donât really know how fair it was to have introduced McLuhan into our short course without focusing much on his work.   His words have buoyed me up during a twenty-year exploration of âmediaâ (whether human, analog, or digital).  Though I have bobbled up and down with his words (finding meaning and losing it), I am still peeling back new layers of nuanced ideas.  What intrigues me today is the McLuhan revival especially in  urlLink  business and management  .  In my search to understand the phenomenon of âcreativityâ (a word that even as late as 1969 was not included in the OED) McLuhanâs words have galvanized my thinking.  In particular, I am more fully aware of the âfigureâ and âgroundâ aspect of any medium.  Throughout my research, I was drawn again and again to the features McLuhan expressed regarding all media (conceptual or concrete) and this alliance led to my early-formed conclusions regarding âcreativity.â I say early because while I defended my thesis, I am still on the journey of discovery that includes the continued exploration of forty leading experts from around the world, and the perusal of the more than 7,000 books, 40,000 academic articles, and 5,430,000 google hits found on the Web! Yes â itâs definitely one of the more challenging fields of investigation!  When I was first introduced to McLuhan in the late 70âs, while studying communications, I was very much aware that his thinking had been drawn from a famous communications theorist,  urlLink  Harold Innis .  I had heard his famous and oft repeated aphorism for  urlLink  medium and message   and we had become more and more familiar with the idea of a âglobal villageâ (long before globalization became a reality).    I hope that our final class will bring a not too cursory closure to our term (although I suspect that the mental dialogue will continue long after) as we will journey into  urlLink  McLuhan's Tetrads  (four questions posed to analyze media) as a tool to explore the medium of language, literacy, technology, and other âmediaâ that have been discussed throughout our class and on this blog.   Thank you for all of your terrific thoughts expressed in this blog!  It has been thoughtful, compelling, humorous and inviting.  Great work!
