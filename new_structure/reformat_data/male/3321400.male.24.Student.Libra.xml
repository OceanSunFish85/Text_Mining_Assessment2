PROJECT EXPERIENCE Â·	Automation of Thermovac Systems in Instrumentation and Measurements  This project was sponsored by IISRO (Indian Institute of Space Research Organization). Perform the automation of thermo vacuum system using Crompton Greaves PLC  to display the chamber temperature, pressure readings on computer by a software program in Visual Basic and serial data transmission. Â·	Project on Cool Mist Roof Cooling System in PLC in Industrial automation    A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is used as the Decision-Making Unit. It Senses the Roof Temperature and Compares it with the Desired Limit. If the Roof Temperature of a Particular Zone Exceeds the Desired Value (User Definable: 85 - 95oF), the Water Valve for that Zone Will be Turned On to Spray the Cool Mist on the Roof For 10 Seconds. It also displays Current Roof Temperature of Each Zone Sequentially on the PLC Front Panel. Â·	Project on Elevator control System in PLC in Industrial Automation  A programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is used to design an elevator control system for a four-story building. Optical sensors are used to detect the arrival of different floor levels. As a part of the project, I have to develop RLL diagram, Relay circuit and serial data communication between the model and the circuit. Â·	Implementation of Transfer Function in Advance Control Systems  The objective of the project is to realize the given transfer function (actual simulation of a existing system), analyze the stability of the presented system, determined steady state error and steady state value by final value theorem. Â·	Temperature Meter in Instrumentation and Measurements  The Temperature Meter was designed using BC547 as a temperature sensor and 3-Â½ Digit LCD display. Â·	Paper on Digital Micro Mirror Device (DMD) â¢ in Micro Electro Mechanical System  This paper presents detailed information on Digital Micro mirror Deviceâ¢ (DMD) technology, a heart of the Digital Light Processing Technology (DLP) â¢ that is used for high-end projection display systems with superior image quality.
