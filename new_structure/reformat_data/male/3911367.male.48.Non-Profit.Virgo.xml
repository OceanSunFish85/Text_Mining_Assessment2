						    Actually, it was 20 years ago tomorrw -- and no -- that was not when Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play -- but it was when I preached my first sermon at the Church I serve, Wentworth Presbyterian.     July 18,1983.     I am not sure anyone could hear my first sermon -- my knees were probably knocking so loudly they probably could not hear what I was saying!     The20 years I have served the Church has been filled with great times and hard times -- joyful times and painful times -- but God has been there all along. My brother in law -- very tongue in cheekly (I hope) -- e-mailed me the other day that the members of Wentworth Presbyterian must be the most patient, forgiving folks in the world to have put up with me this long!:)     Well, that may be the case -- but the real credit goes to God. It has been God's love that I have been able to experience from the Church and others -- God's love that I have been blessed to be able to share with others -- God's love that I have experienced from my wife, Sally, and she has experiended from me -- God's love thatwe have been able to share with others as we share our ministry together.     I remeber a 100 year old lady was asked how she lived that long. She said "I kept breathing"!If asked how I have stayed in the ministry at one Church so long    I would   have to say :"I kept praying"! Prayerhas been my strength. Prayer -- and showing God's love I have experienced with the world.    Jesus said it best: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart -- soul -- mind -- and strength -- and your neighbor as yourself."    Love God.     Love others.    I plan to celebrate tomorrw -- for God is indeed good -- and so are the folks at Wentworth Presbyterian!

						      Somethimes I tend to lose track of God's presense.      I try to recognise God's presenseat all times -- but I must admit that sometimes I just can't see it. I let other things get in the way.      Like today -- when someone critcisedthe outreach agency I work for and said we did not care for those in need. I must admit that I did not feel God's presense -- but felt hurt and -- yes -- angry.       Then this afternoon I was in charge of the agency's food distribution -- andadmit that in the heat and the hectic atmosphere of over 200 folks wanting food I lost sight of God's presense again.       But then I look at the face of a child who was born 30 minutes after her mother got food from us several months ago -- and almost gave birth in line waiting for food.      Or Iam encouraged when someone stops to thank me for what we do.      Or I receive an e-mail from my bother in law congratulating me for reaching a milestone in ministry.      And I remember -- yea -- God is here -- with me -- forgivng me for my sins -- and somehow working through me.      No-- I am not perfect -- but sometimes God's love shines through my imperfectoins -- and I remeber that God is with me all the time!       Until next time -- peace!

						        This is my first attempt at blogging -- but I think I'll like it!  What will I blog about? I don't know -- but maybe about things I see in the world that remind me about God's love and how real it is for me.  As a Presbyterian minister that appeals to me!       Today I saw God's love in action in a real way.  A waitress at local restaurant was leaving for home when she had some type of seizure in the parking lot.  Everyone in the restaurant -- and it was very crowded and busy -- ran to help.  I guess there are still times love wins over food! I'm glad of that!

						        I must admit that when I started blogging last month, it was mostly out of curiosity -- something fun and interesting but not really useful --  but, as with a lot of my 48 year old ideas about technolgy, I have been proved wrong.   I have learned the past few days how a web log can be a real instrument of God -- helping me and others keep up with family members in need.      Yesterday my nephew, Rob, who lives in Orlando, FL, began blogging on his web site ( urlLink www.orangejack.com ) about his experiences in Hurricane Charley.  It was a lot easier for him to post updates and pictures on his web log than having to send out e-mails to everyone.  It was truly a blessing for me -- and many others from what I understand -- to go to Rob's web site and get the latest updates. Some of his updates were prayers for God to be with all in the path of Charley, and some of the comments were prayers also.       It just goes to show that God is at work -- even in the midst of storms -- even in modern technology -- in so many ways.  I praise God for all that have survived Charley -- including Rob and his wife Patricia -- pray for those who have lost property and loved ones -- and for being at work -- even in blogs!

						        It has been a while -- but I want to get back to blogging more often.      It has been a long day -- teaching a Bible Study this morning, getting food for tomorrow's food distribution at the agancy I work for, talking to Board members about how we can get more food -- and more funds for purchasing food, talking to a congrgatoin member about family concerns.  It can be tiring -- and sometmes I want to take some time where -- as the hit country song says -- "I've got a few days where I don't have to be me"!       But then I look at the members of the congregation who are somehow touched by God through what I do.     Or I look at the people that are helped at the Outreach Center.     And I know that somewhere -- somehow -- God is at work -- and I should be, too!      Until next time --- Bill
