      This is a new segment that I will call "If I ruled the world..." Basically it is what I would change to better society. Usually it is just something that has been pissing me off. My first Installment is called: "If I ruled the world: Crying Children In Movie Theaters." Enjoy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If I ruled the world: Crying Children In Movie Theaters      Lets face it. Most people like enjoying a movie. When I go to the movies these are usually the things that make it a good experience:   - A dark theater  -When everyone turns off their cell phones  - No fatass sitting next to mewho hasn't showered in 3 months and is eating a 50 gallonbucket of popcorn  -No one talking...At all.But especiallysomeone talkingabout what is about to happen 10 seconds before it happens  - A quiet theater   Hmmmm...Now lets just think about that last one for a minute. I could have made a 50 page list of things that fit under that general subject. The main thing I hate about that is  parents bringing crying children to the movies .   Everyone knows about what I am talking about. The one very "responsible" parent who brought their 2 month old child to the theater. If you didn't realize that I was being scarcastic suicide is still an option. Please remove yourself from the gene pool. Anyway, I think that this is what goes on at the hospital when a child of two idiots is born:   Man: "Wow look how cute he is..."  Woman: "Life is so beautiful."  Man: "I know...Anyway lets hurry up and cut the cord so we can all go see a movie."   I'm sorry, but that is my only explanation for what is going on. I really don't care if you bring a newborn to a G/PG rated flick...But a PG-13 and R? What the fuck is wrong with you?!? This happens all the time in these kinds of movies. What the hell are the theater owners thinking when they sell littlefresh out the wombTimmya ticket?...   I mean,what kid wouldn't want to be traumatized 5 minutes after birth?   That is why if I was the ruler of the world I make taking your newbornchild to the movies illegal. Not only that, but if found guiltythe sentencewill alwaysbe instant capital punishment....By firing squad.       - OrcSolidSnake
