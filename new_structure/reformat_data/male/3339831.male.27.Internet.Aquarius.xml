                                     Following on with the underpants themeâ¦.                 In a recent survey, it was confirmed that 64 per cent of US consumers admit to connecting to the Internet via Wi-FI while wearing only their underclothes, according to a survey by Californian company, IOGEAR  .                  As many of you know, I have a wireless LAN at home. So nearly 2/3 of the time â according to this survey anyways â you run the risk of chatting to me in my underpants and nothing else.                Is that a risk you are willing to take?                End of Rant

                                    Now that is a SUPER Wedgie.                I saw this story ââ urlLink Wedgieâ led to death near sports bar, lawyer says â and just had to have a laugh. What immediately springs to mind is âonly in     America    â.                Now I am sure that we all know what a wedgie is so I wonât explain but apparently the lawyer had to explain to the jury. The wedgie spree was initially âinspiredâ by â   Jackass: The Movie   â when one redneck ripped another redneckâs underpants clean off his body.                  âWhat started with a wedgie inside a       Southwest  Roanoke       sports bar ended with a disembowelment and fatal neck wound in a dark field beyond.â                   To me it sounds like they were then inspired by â   Scream   â with all the stabbing that then went on.                Look out the producers of    Jackass   , cause I reckon that one of the families is about to sue your ass!                So the moral of the story, is that wearing of underpants leads to dying. So stay alive and go commando.                End of (Underpantless) Rant.

                                     The Polly Pipe gets blocked                 My usual sub â 20 minute drive to work this morning turned into 45 minutes, thanks to a minor accident at the entrance to the Polly Pipe.                 For non-Perth readers, the Polly Pipe is the tunnel that connects the East and West sides of the city and is named after Graham âPollyâ Farmer, who apparently, played football for both East and     West Perth    . Apparently cause I donât follow local footy and donât give a hoot one way or the other.                So since itâs opening 4 years ago, everyone has just referred to it as the Polly Pipe.                Today, Polly Pipe suffered a blockage and had a major case of constipation. Some idiot tradesman managed to jackknife his trailer blocking the two lanes right at the entrance. Oh joy.                So here I am, stuck behind another tradesman who is driving the biggest piece of shit this side of Collie when I noticed his bumper sticker. Now the only reason I did notice it was because it was the newest and cleanest thing on the entire truck.                Quite simply it read:                 âFree Paulineâ                 To which, I had to shake my head. I found it quite ironic that we had a blockage in Pollyâs Pipe and I spent 35 minute staring at a sticker which wants to free Pauline Hanson from jail. Mainly because the mere mention of Pauline Hanson should be enough to give any thinking Australian the shits. Just merely thinking about her shouldâve gotten old Pollyâs plumbing running again faster than a bad Indian curry served by Qantas.                The only time Pauline shouldâve ever of been freed from jail, is to attract all her fanatical supporters so that they could all chant repeatedly â   Please Explain   â until such time as they all run out of breathe.                What it really comes down to, is I shouldâve phoned in sick today and stayed in bed with my new electrical blanket. Hmmm, nice.                Thank god it is Friday and we are going to the pub for a liquid lunch.                End of Rant

                                    It was a sad day last Tuesday. I broke my IPOD. I was listening to it at work whilst charging it and my dam cell phone rang. So I went to answer it and managed to knock the IPOD off my desk.                Everything looked okay with it, until I realized that it was no longer charging.                So during my âsick dayâ *  cough cough  * on Wednesday I spent some time on the Apple website trying to find a service centre. I ended up ringing the Customer Case line, where I left a message because I was assured they would ring me back within the hour. Now I know that Apple does things different and one of those must be the way they count time. Cause 5 hours later in non-Apple time, I get a call back.                So off I trots to the nearest repair place and pleaded ignorant â  It just stopped charging, I donât understand why  â.                Today, I have my IPOD back thanks to the wonderful Apple warranty. Well not mine, but a replacement one. So now I have to reload all my tunes â oh fun. At least that will keep me entertained for a few hours.                End of (Happy) Rant.

                                    Got sent this link by a friend of mine from softball with a note of âthis has some similarities to youâ.                 urlLink http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4020n=3                 So I read through the article, and god dam it, he is right! Because that is the way I act at softball more though necessity rather than anything wanting to be. Having said that, I do it so well!                Here are some of my favorite quotes:                â  Asshole Admits To Being Asshole In Supreme Asshole Move  â        Priceless! Talk about summing up the entire story in the title.                 âThat's a real supreme asshole moveâadmitting you're an asshole and not giving a shit     â        Well it does go par for the course really.                â   Make way for Mr. Asshole   â        Simple, yet effective. Why deny it. Go with it I say.                 ââ¦having declared himself a supreme unrepentant asshole, Seversen gleefully explored the freedoms of his newfound role      .     â        If you have admitted it, make the most of it..                         And the best line of all â the one which I am thinking of putting on my next set of Softball Business Cards                   Make sure you put it in huge letters on the front page: 'Mark Seversen is the world's biggest asshole, and he doesn't give a fuck whether you like it or not.â                   Funnily enough, I have said many of these types of lines before when talking about if players like me or not - âcept I have used a much harsher word to describe myself.                And I am sure that some regular readers of this blog would tend to agree.                End of Rant.

                                    Saw this âgemâ of a link on the net. It allows you to work out which of the gorgeous blonde Olsen twin is right for you. Hmmm.                So check this out:       urlLink http://www.marykateorashley.com/                  This is wrong on so many levels. Not just because the twins are still not even legal to drink in the     US     yet but the fact that two very old guys (photos in the       urlLink About Us       section) are pimping them out.   James   scares me because he writes a bi-weekly newsletter about these girls, whilst   Mark   is âacting presidentâ of their fan club. Hmmmm, what is he acting at? Being a perverted old man? Well buddy, I think you might be getting that role permanently soon!                So either these two guys have way too much time on their hands (not to mention something else with all that looking at photos of the Olsen twins) or they are stalkers. Personally I am leaning towards stalkers who have too much time on their hands.                End of Rant

                                    So that is the weekend. Way too quick really. Canât wait for the long weekend coming up.                Didnât do much other than the usual softball and catching up with tha boys for a few drinks on Saturday night.                Thanks to skirt wearing   Kat  , we went to a Chinese restaurant in     Como     that was stuck in a time warp because we had a voucher. The food was surprisingly good and thanks to the now expired Entertainment book, was cheap too.                From there it was off to the     Como     hotel for a few more beers before switching to Vodka under the influence of the crazy dressed   Pete  .   Pete   wasnât the only one dressed crazily with one girl wearing a skirt that looked like a belt. Hint for any skirt wearers out there â if it is short enough to be a belt, donât stretch up to hug a tall male friend because you will expose yourself. Not a good look really.                Speaking of exposed, as we left â with a few more glasses courtesy of the nice folks at the     Como     â we were shown why girls in short dresses shouldnât sit on curbs. Oh my, we could see her underpants. Seems     Perth     girls need to learn how to dress a bit better and should really try to wear more when it is bloody cold.                Sunday I went down to my old club to watch a couple of their games. Seems I canât even attend a softball game without getting a mouthful of abuse. This time it wasnât even a player. Put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. Sometimes I wonder why I bother.                End of Rant.

Well done to all the people at Kanoodle. Check out the Kanoodle Kam as well.                 Ad-Tech                  urlLink Ad-Tech  starts on Monday, at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. I attended last yearâs event and it was a blast. Not sure how the conference is as I didnât get to many sessions but the parties were great. The Palace Hotel is an awesome 5 Star Hotel which is a couple of hundred US per night. If you ever make it to San Francisco I would suggest just checking this hotel out, down town.                Ad-Tech is being billed as the largest Search Engine Marketing Conference in the world. It used to be all about affiliate marketing and banner networks. Now it is all about Search Engine Marketing with a huge emphasis on Pay Per Click (PPC) Advertising. Both Overture and Google will have a huge presence there, with Google hosting a breakfast.                So to all of those people going, have fun. Stay away from the Tequila shots â they are evil.                End of Rant.

                                     Sensis Plot to Wack Google                 Telstraâs Sensis Corporation is planning to enter the Australian Search Market with a product aimed at the youngsters. Many of you may recall that Sensis bought up Looksmartâs assets after the marriage between NineMSN and Looksmart dissolved in January of this year.                 Now they are letting the world know what they are planning to do with this technology one media release at a time.                So let us look at what Sensis does:                   White Pages      Book and  urlLink   website           Yellow Pages      Book and  urlLink   website           Map directions      via  urlLink   Whereis                     Well now they are going to do a Search Engine with contextual based adds using the Looksmart technology.                 Anyone remember the failed Telstra.com portal for the late 90s? It failed because well, it was Telstra doing it. More than that, Telstra just couldnât compete with the likes of NineMSN and Yahoo.                Anyways, the article is kind of interesting. Apparently Sensis is planning to take on Google but I would suggest that Overture is being the more aggressive P4P provider in the Australian Search Market at the moment. How many deals have they signed recently?   Mel Boche   (formally of  urlLink AltaVista Australia ) and now  urlLink Overture Australia  has been having more press releases than you can poke a hot contextual add at and has stated they want 80% of the contextual search market in     Australia    .                Also quoted in the article is my friend       Gavin Appel      . Well done for getting your name in lights   Gavin  .                 So if you feel that way inclined, read all about the Sensis search product at  urlLink   news.com.au.    Be warned, a long article.                Seems that Sensis is following the Microsoft tactic of âif you havenât built it yet but are currently building it, then send out a press release a week until you have finishedâ. Dazzle them with PR bullsh*t.                End of Rant.

                                     HitWise                 Today, I spent an afternoon looking over  urlLink HitWise's  latest Competitive Research tools, with   Lyndon  . Wow, they are doing some great things at the moment.                For those that donât know HitWise, they are an Australian company which collects the log data from a large number of ISPs around the world. They interpret this data to produce reports on the top visited 500,000 websites in the world, categorized by industry. So you can see how many people are going to your competitorâs website or your own.                Some really great technology that I would really recommend having a look at. However, be prepared to part with some serious cash to get HitWiseâs data.                 Getting Hits Big League Style                 A few months ago I was asked to answer a series of questions regarding the new  urlLink Overture Site Match  program managed by  urlLink ineedhits.com .

Happy Birthday to   Raymi   and   Kylie  .                May your glass been refilled as many times as there was birthday candles on your cake.                 Mel Movesâ¦. Again                 Yep, again. Not only is she moving house she is escaping the dreaded cycle of rent and strange house mates.                So to   Melissah,   congrats on becoming a home owner again.                 Dave of the Pink Shorts                 Speaking of getting rid of strange house mates, the   Daz   has swapped the pink short wearing   Dave   for the skirt wearing   Kat.   In the process Sasha has gained a new friend in     Chester    . Sounds like a good deal all round really.                 Daz      has had a long history of strange house mates, as I am sure we all fondly (?) remember:                    Grant     : Oh the      smell!         Grantâs Girlie     :      She actually got close to that smell?         Aaron     : Did he      actually live there or just hide in his room?         Julie     : Now the      sister-in-law                  I, for one, am eagerly awaiting the official house warming party with appropriately alarming theme involving men wearing dresses.

       A Bitch   So what is with people who ring at 7am on a Monday morning?  Today I received a phone call from a softball contact at 7am who _  demanded  _ to know where the _  hell  _ certain things were.   My desire to help any person at 7am on a Monday is pretty low and when they speak to me like that, it is even lower.    I will get back to them - about 11pm tonight! haha   Blatant Cross-Plug   Thanks to  ded , the author (assuming he wants to take responsibility) of  urlLink English Summer Rain  for pointing out my rather "dark and enigmatic" blog to his thousands of readers.

      No, not a trick question or an innuendo.  In a recent game, I saw a play that has been sticking in my mind over the past few days.  The play itself isn't important but more the outcome and its effect on the game of softball.  The Softball Rule Book says that for an out to be awarded on a force out, the ball must beat the runner.  So in the event of a "tie" (or a bang-bang play) the ball did not beat the runner and therefore it must be a safe.  I disagree.    There is more to this play than a simple out or safe.  It is about rewarding good plays made by good players who are doing their job of playing softball.  For example, a ball hit to a fielder who cleanly picks the ball up and throws to the 1st base player is a good play for the fielding team but a bad play for the batting team - how can it be a good hit if it goes directly to a fielder?  This is an out, even if it is a tied play.  Take the same situation, where the fielder now fumbles the ball.  This is a bad play by the fielding team and should not be rewarded.  It is a safe because the fielding team has not done their job.  I have read  Andrew Rindfleish's  "  urlLink It is Over When It is Over Article  " previously but have only recently started to grasp its significance.    As umpires I believe we should be rewarding good play and making sure the expectations of the players, the crowd and most importantly, the game are met.  If they all expect a certain outcome from a play then we should be providing them with what they are expecting.  People do expect to see outs when a ball is hit to the infield, fielded cleanly and a strong throw over to first is made.  If the fielder errors or even fumbles that ball, then the crowd expects it to be a safe.    Reward good plays by good players; don't reward bad plays by good players and match the expectations set by the game, the players and the crowd.  End of rant.

      Part of this blog is devoted to work stuff that I do - the reason will be revealed in future revisions of the blog.  So here are a couple of gems that I found which were kind of interesting:   Search Engine College    urlLink Search Engine Optimization College :  An article which talks about the new Search Engine College run by  Kalena Jordan  of " urlLink Kal's Blog " fame.  If you are a member of  urlLink WebMasterWorld  you can read what some of the other industry professionals are saying about it (and other SEO courses) at the  urlLink thread  I started.   Hitwise Teams with Google Australia to come to Perth   Also, my good friend  Gavin Appel  from Hitwise will be coming to Perth to run a conference with  Kate Vale  (Google Australia and New Zealand).  Should be a good show.  Seats are limited to register for the  urlLink Hitwise Marketing Seminar .   PubCon 6.5    I send my apologies now as I am not going to go to what is easily the most enjoyable, informative but hardest  urlLink Search Engine Marketing  conference around.  As the moto of the conference goes:   " at any SEM conference, the real work gets done in the bar, so lets skip the conference and go straight to the bar ".    To all that are going - may you work hard!   SES Canada   SES Canada has wrapped up and the gossip is starting to flow.  Appears that Google is trying to win some support by hosting their first "Google Dance" since San Jose last year.  Stay tuned for further information regarding SES Canada - wish I had been there to give you a first hand report.

      Well it has been a quiet and lazy weekend in Perth.   On Friday night had a few drinks with a colleague from work who is off to bigger and better things (Best of Luck MikeT :) ).  Then it was off to see Van Halsing with "tha boys".  I liked it but the one known as Pete was not impressed.  For some strange reason, he decided to read the reviews AFTER watching the film.  Kinda arse about if you ask me.  Anyways, the film got a bagging from the net-critics.  Personally any vampire film that doesn't include SMG running around in a short skirt is always going to be a disappointment.  Saturday was the normal Softball for me in the afternoon.  As it is Winter Season (State League Softball is taking a break), I was at Dale Men's Softball Association to do two games.  I was given the game of the round between the two top Men's team in the competition.  I had a good game, calling lots of strikes.  Saturday night was playing pool with the boys and testing out Pete's new tires in the wet.   Hopefully the weather will clear up on Sunday so I can get out of the house and my washing will dry.

      Okay, I have finally done it.  After years of being on the internet and working in the industry for the past 15 months.  I have written a blog for you all to laugh at.  Part of the reason is professional interest, with Blog SPAMMING being such a big issue at the moment in influencing SERPs.    Another reason is I have a computer, an active mind and way too much time on my hands!  Not sure what will fill these pages, but for those who know me, they can already guess - lots of Waz's bullsh*t.  Hopefully enough to keep you coming back for more.

                                    On the radio as I drove into work the other day, the two morning idiots (referred to as breakfast DJs) were talking about âmetrosexualsâ and âretrosexualsâ. I knew what a metrosexual was but wasnât so clear on retrosexaul.                 The  urlLink Word Spy  was the first site in Google that came up and is a great site defining various words that have found themselves into common useage (including to do a google as well).                 So what is a mextrosexual?                  metrosexual           (met.roh.SEK.shoo.ul)   n  . An urban male with a strong aesthetic sense who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance and lifestyle.        â  metrosexuality     n  .                    And then a retrosexual?                  retrosexual           (ret.roh.SEK.shoo.ul)   n  . A man with an undeveloped aesthetic sense who spends as little time and money as possible on his appearance and lifestyle. Also:   retro-sexual  .        â  retrosexuality     n  .                              Word Spy also provided a few new sexual words for me.                   technosexual           (tek.noh.SEK.shoo.ul)   n  . A male with a strong aesthetic sense and a love of technology.        â  technosexuality     n  .                   Example Citations:         Earlier this year, people who spend less money on mousse and more on mouse pads decided that if the style-savvy guys could get their hands on a marketable brand name, then the uber-geeks could certainly come up with something better than nerd: Thus, the term   technosexual   was born.         A   technosexual   is not simply in touch with his feminine side but is connected to it on multiple platforms. He likes gadgets that have lots of gigabytes but are still small enough to fit in his pocket.  âEric Edwards, A new kind of lingo for those who tango,   Orlando Sentinel   (    Florida    ),     May 7, 2004                     In true geek styleâ¦oh excuse me, technosexual style â there is even a website.  urlLink TechnoSexual.Org  has all the cool gadgets any self respecting technosexual needs (oh the puns).                So now I am confused. Am I a metro, retro or techno sexual? Hell, atm I donât even think I can say I am say that I am sexual!                 End of (sexually confused) Rant

      Google up the ante by offering 1,000Megs of storage space. Yahoo has matched it.  And now Hotmail gives you 250Meg (well as of July anyways).

      Once again, in a fit of boredom, I was at  urlLink English Summer Rain  having a look at what the lad had been up to. And stagger me ded, it appears that the  ded  and I am currently listening to the same band.  None other than Eskimo Joe latest  A Song is a City .  I never thought I would see the day that we were listening to the same music, let alone the fact that I went to a concert that he wanted to go to.  Oh my.  How the tables have turned.  Speaking of which, the concert at the Monkey Bar was pretty good.  Some local thrash metal band called SnowMan started off.  They were pretty average - a love em or hate em type band.  The Avenues were next and played exactly the same set as last time I saw them. At least this time the songs were more familar.  And then it was time for the 'Joe.  They played all the songs off their new album as well as off the debut CD.  As this was their last gig of the tour, they were really  having some fun.  The 400 plus strong crowd loved it with one dickhead behind me liking it a bit too much.  In his excitement he kept on elbowing me right in the middle of the back - or maybe it was just his drunken stagger.  After we had words, he decided that he would be better off on another part of the dance floor and I was back to enjoying the Joe in peace.  All in all a good night - although paying $4.00 for a bottle of water was a bit steep.  End of Rant

      On Saturday I was on the plate with a former WA Under 19 Menâs âpitcherâ throwing.  Luckily I had one of the best young catcher in WA to try and control this person who throws hard but has no idea where they are going.  Despite the best efforts of the catcher, I still ended up with several bruises.  It was late in the game â Top of the 7th, 2 out, runner on 2nd base with a count of 1-ball, 2 strikes to be exact.  Catcher sets up with his glove about 2 balls width off the outside edge.  Pitcher throws the ball but instead of hitting the spot the catcher gave him, throws it inside.  The ball _just_ cuts the inside edge of the plate and tails into the right hand batter.  The catcher does his best and lunges at the ball. He managed to get his glove onto it, knocking it down and preventing it from hitting me.   The runner from two now heads to three, whilst the pitcher throws a tantrum for me not calling it a strike.  I have to say, there is no way on this earth, that I can call that pitch a strike, even if it did just cut the edge of the plate.  All everyone in the crowd and on the bench has seen, is the catcher move at least 20 inches to his left to knock this ball down.  If I have called that as a strike at that level of game, I wouldâve been lynched.  Just goes to show how little these people understand the game.  Oh and for the record, that team still won the game 13 â 1.  End of Softball Rant.

                                    The airline industry is pretty tough at the moment, with airlines all doing whatever they can to get bums on seats â unless you are Qantas, you just charge more.                In these tough times, it is great to see one of     America    âs great restaurant franchises rising to the ch    allen    ge and plowing full âabreastâ into becoming an airline and servicing the needs to the traveling public.                  âHooters Air of       America       started service from Gary/Chicago International Airport to       Myrtle Beach      ,       S.C.      , on Thursday.â                  âIn addition to a standard crew of pilots and flight attendants, each Hooters flight is staffed with a least two Hooters Girls waitresses.â                 Makes me wonder, if Virgin Airlines and Hooters Air combined, what would the name of the new company be?

                                    Last night, tha boyz and I watched the Day After Tomorrow.                Now the movie was okay â typical     Hollywood     block buster style trash but watchable.                It was the incidents surrounding the movie which were all the fun was had.                 Darren      turned up to my place complete with a carton of Becks (currently on sale at Woolworths Liquor for $42 a carton) which is always a good way to start a night off. I think that is what helped with the funniness of the night â we were drinking on a school night.                So the winner of the various awards for the night are â¦.                 Quote of the night      goes to the moe-harwked one, Pete (paraphrased here for language reasons)                â   I shagged your sister and she screamed your name   â                Pure class.                 Arrogant Annoying Bitch                 In a shock win,   Daz   takes the gong from   Waz   â normally a shoe in for said award.                 However, the   Daz  -man earnt his award for his consistent arrogance and all round bitchiness last night, capped off with his drive thru attendant antics â yes she can have her ânickel backâ.                 Stupid Car Antics in Front of A Police Car                       And winner isâ¦â¦  Waz   â both first and second place                 First Place      :      Pulling out into traffic on     Albany Hwy     from a Give-Way sign into the inside lane and accelerating heavily, to end up next to a Police Car. The old grumpy copper in the passenger seat didnât seem too impressed with my driving skill and gave us a good old staring down.                 Second Place      :      Swerving across the road to annoy the passenger in the back seat (who was being an annoying bitch) when there is a stopped police car 300meters, at the next set of traffic lights.                 So the moral of this award is to watch more closely for police cars!                 Too Cool for School award goes to      â¦..   Pete                  For trying to be inconspicuous drinking beer in the cinema and hide the bottle from usher during the movie and only succeeding in spilling it over the floor.                 Looks like another trip to Woolworthâs Liquor to buy another carton of Becks â the first one is nearly gone and it is a long weekend coming up. More alcohol fueled fun.

                                    So I was at  urlLink English Summer Rain  today and was greeted by a rather scary picture, of a tubby man in a bikini, holding a Martini whilst smoking a ciggie. Now he wasnât drinking alone cause he has a tan dog.                Now I had no idea what a weemee was until I followed the link. It is a way of creating your own personalized character to have it displayed on your IM. Apparently. And apparently billions of people have done this already.                Quite frankly, I am afraid. The fact that it does sort of like   ded   is enough to put a shiver down the spine. But   ded   with facial hairâ¦now I, for one, fully support the right for bloggers to have a bit of poetic license but I think   ded   is stretching the truth a little bit too far there. Most 13 year old boys have more facial hair than smooth baby face himself (as do most grandmothers!).                It also looks like   ded   has been sinking into the banger and mash and washing it down with a few too many pints, cause that figure hugging black bikini is letting it all hang outâ¦and over the sides. I am guessing he went for the black two piece because MSN didnât allow the use of chaps.                 The hat and glasses are vintage   ded  .

So 100 guess me questions sounds easy but when the questions are very ambiguous it gets quite hard. One word (or lack of said word) can totally change the meaning and means you get it wrong.                 I think that I did ok. Hoping for over 85% which is an okay mark but wouldâve liked higher. I only need 80% to maintain a variety of different other accreditations.

                                    I often get asked why I umpire by lots of different people and they expect an answer. I normally sprout out the standard line of âbecause I enjoy it and am challenged by itâ. However, some of the time I do wonder myself why I do it, because I donât always enjoy it and lately, not exactly challenged by it.                The games I did on Sunday remind me exactly why I umpire â they were high quality games, played by two teams in a professional manner in good sprit. There was no fuss, no bullshit and just good quality softball being played by 18 athletes. On my own game front, I had one of my best plates in a very long time. I was calling a good consistent zone that was a nice balance for both hitters and pitchers. Both pitchers commented after the game that I did a good job. Canât ask for more than that.                At the end of the day, I did enjoy it â especially after the previous dayâs game. It tends to make you forget all the other crap which happens.                End of Rant

                                    Yesterday at softball (in the game before the now infamous princess game) one of the state league players hit the ball for a triple. The next batter was the third out, ending the innings.                So, I thought I would relay the conversation here, to show how a simple thing can end with me putting my size 12 into my equally large mouth:                Waz::  Nice piece of the ball.        Player:: Yeah, it came off the bat well but hurt liked a bastard. I still canât hit the ball properly with out pain.                 He holds out his right hand for me to look at and the middle knuckle is about 4 times the size it should be.                   Waz:: Ouch. What did you hit?        Player:: A wall.        Waz:: Well that was a bit silly.        Player:: Yeah but my best mate slept with my girlfriend.                (Now if I had been smart I wouldâve stopped here but noâ¦.I continue)                Waz:: Well better the wall than him (trying to think on my feet)        Player:: It was only cause I couldnât find the prick and the wall was closer.                I should point out that âPlayerâ is about 6 foot 4 inches tall and built like a brick shit house. Not a man I would like to be coming after me.                At that point the conversation ended (thankfully) before I could my foot even further into my mouth.                When will I learn?                End of Rant.                Waz

                                    I have been called many, many things on a softball diamond. I have had my parentage questioned and called just about everything under the sun. Today, I got called something new.                 I am officially a Princess.                 It was confirmed during my game today, when a player â who will remain nameless but we will call him #62 â told me I was a Princess. Not once. But twice. Now #62 is not the brightest light globe on the Christmas Tree because the first time I issued him with a warning. So just with 7 minutes left to go in the game, he ups the ante to say that I am on âOn a power trip, hey princessâ.                I am many things, but the least of them is a Princess. Unless perhaps he means like Princess Fiona from Shrek fame or maybe even the toe sucking Princess Fergie herself.                Hmmm, you have to worry. So off to the tribunal for #62 next week.                End of (royal) Rant.

                                    From  urlLink The Word Spy , the Waz Word of the Week isâ¦..                  Furkid                  n. A pet treated as though it were one's child. Also: fur-kid, fur kid.                 Example Citation:         My name is Brenda Mejia and I'm owned by two Australian cattle dogs. I don't have kids, so I call my dogs my 'furkids.' They keep me as busy as a soccer mom.        âBrenda Mejia, Pet stories, The Desert Sun (    Palm Springs    ,     CA    ),     April 30, 2004                              Notes:         The code of politically correct speech has come down against the word pet, which at first blush seems about as inoffensive a term as there is in the language. It has referred to a domesticated or tamed animal since the 16th century, and has even branched out to mean a favorite person, or one who is treated with special kindness. What's wrong with that? Plenty, say the animal-rights activists. Pet implies the human ownership of an animal, and that just won't do. The preferred term now is companion animal (1977).                 The term furkid, of course, takes us beyond the treatment of the animal as a mere companion and into the realm of surrogate kid-hood. Now we animal guardians (1997) can apply our hyper-parenting skills to our dogs, cats, and other four-legged members of the family.                 That some of us are doing this is further evidenced by the fact that a number of synonyms for furkid exist, including furbaby (1993; also: fur baby) and furchild (2000; also: fur child).                 Example Citation #2:         Most everything I ever needed to learn about babies I learned from my dogs.                 Although I never went as far as calling them my fur kids, dogs long predated babies in my life. Indeed, in other pages of this newspaper, I am a pets columnist, writing about everything from bearded dragons to border collies. But as I begin to compose the occasional mothering column as well, I've discovered that there's plenty of crossover wisdom between species.        âDenise Flaim, Triplet Chronicles; Dogged lessons in baby care, Newsday,     May 17,  2004                     The ch    allen    ge for all of you is to use âfurkidâ in a sentence as many times as you possible can.                My extension on furkid is âfurnieceâ. That is my sister has a furkid, therefore I have a furniece.                End of Rant

                                    As some of you may know, I am in the midst of a bit of a fitness craze at the moment. To support this fad, I have been looking into a few local gyms.                So I sent off an email to a few ones close to my house to get an idea on how much they would be.                I had to laugh when I got a response back from one of the big chain gyms, which has a local franchise. The franchise is owned and operator by Fabio. I shouldnât be surprised that Fabio has a gym. Now I have to go visit the gym to see if Fabio has long blonde hair, talks with an accent and kisses his biceps at every opportunity.                End of Rant.

                                    Another run in with the long arm of the law last night, following on from my weekend flashing experience.                As I was driving home through Subiacco, I get flashed again â this time from behind by a police car. Over I pulls. At least this time I was sh*tting myself because (for once) I knew I wasnât speeding. So here I was, sitting in the dark as to why I had been pulled over.                I chatted to the constable who was happy to shed some light onto this great criminal mystery. Apparently I had my fog lights on. Apart from lighting up the road they have the added benefit of making your wallet $100 lighter and taking away 3 demerit points off your license, if the police decide to take it that far. Ouch! Who wouldâve thought that two little lights in your bumper could get so expensive!                So a quick flick of a switch and the fog lights are off. The friendly copper decides to check my license (how I got away with a drivers license that doesnât have a signature on it any more after I washed it I donât know) and a Random Breath Test, and I was free to go.                 This is my fourth warning in about 8 months. I have had warnings for:                1.         Speeding â by a lot! Apparently I was going a bit too fast for him to get an accurate lock on my speed hence a warning.         2.         Radar Detector obscuring vision â I donât think he could be bothered getting out of the car, so quickly removing it from the middle of the windscreen and another warning.        3.         Cornering too fast â with an all wheel drive car you can corner fast without it sliding but the tires do squeal a bit. Another warning and a suggestion that I slow down around corners.        4.         Fog Lights â You have heard the story                So all in all, I have been pretty lucky the past 8 months with the boys in blue, who are just doing their job. Guess I should start behaving now cause sooner or later, my luck is about to run out when I run into a copper having a bad day or who hasnât made their quota yet.                End of Rant

                                    Today, I actually got the bike out of the shed and rode to see my parents. It was quite a nice ride despite the rain. I wanted to try out my  urlLink TuneBelt  as well as get some further exercise this weekend.                It was raining quite heavily as I tried to cross over at Oats Street / Shepeton Road, so I didnât bother waiting for the lights - rather I crossed on the red. Low and behold I managed to set off the red light camera guarding this intersection. I never realized those flashes from the cameras were so bright until I happened to be looking straight at it as it flashed me. I certainly hope that they got my good side.                Being the good citizen I am, I will be going to the local police station to identify myself so that I can obtain the appropriate fine. Yeah right.                End of Rant

          I found out today that my address was online.  Intrigued by where this would be, I turned to good old trusty Google and did a search.             Low and behold, my undergrad thesis from 2001 is now online, further confirming (at least to me) that the majority of internet content is garbage.  And my thesis only adds 120 pages of garage to the many, thousands of pages that are already out there.               And letâs not forget a big thank you to Curtin University of Technology for publishing my previous address on the internet.    Well done guys. No seriously, well done.             End of Rant

Jill Whalen of  urlLink High Search Engine Rankings  fame has posted some photos on her site. I recognize many of these faces having shared many a drink with them all. Also good to see some new faces.                The  urlLink Trellian Boys  apparently had The Flight From Hell. Picture this â a 747 full of people, past the half way point of a 14 hour flight to LA from     Melbourne    . Every toilet on the entire plane stops working but the bladder and bowls of the people on board continue to work. Rather than gross you totally out, lets just say apparently a few people found alternative uses for air sickness bags. Ewwww.                No wonder they are grimacing in the photos!
