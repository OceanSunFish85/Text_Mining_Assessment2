           I awoke to the sound of the trumpet wailing, blaring waking me down to the noise of the wind through a pipe like a knife in my head sunnyshine in my day no where to go need to work on it you know too much due to these new post I'm making awake and it's @round 11:00 I begin by getting clean low pressure from a spring soft water bubbles foaming clean shave and off i'm going in an a/c challenged car a freon tank too far from full to AAA to get re-ensured of insurance for the state demands it so i empty the account of all the funds and hope the wires cross in timely order to ensure the insure money clears without causing overdraw due to card checking dealings I'm feeling low paying job need another but summer beckons to be played go to far side of the world to pick up Sean then we're gone to Tampa Theatre 'Life of Brian' seeing as how i look on the bright side of life slow need to get a better pay for force through a distance to get back to the house and pick up the hard drive external to upload to Sean's new one all the fun songs and programs we share some conversation about girls hot on the TB Storm squad Sean not far yesterday was today now past the midnight hour so like that's right a flower i'll close and await for flame reliant on the spark to start a Stanley Cup game gonna win in 5 Barnacles at 8.

      Live Journal is Pissing Me OFF with itâs slow, non-working server.  Wysmienity PierÃ³gi Sen  Okay, so the date went okay. I donât really have anything to compare it to in my own personal life, so this is now the standard by which all other dates will be measured.  The short of it: â¢	Went to Centro Ybor â The Dish o	The host guy thought I was there for business, not to be a customer. So I guess I looked professional.  â¢	Worked on her tattoo ideas  o	5x3, left bicep area of a coral ridge w/ sharks, fishes, and (duh) coral is the idea. Oh and sea grass, but specific species found naturally in the area.  â¢	Made a few weak moves (total lack of  knowledge of all things âsuaveâ) o	Please, I canât give those awayâ¦cuz itâs really embarrassing.  â¢	We âshoppedâ a little bit o	She wants to buy a shirt that says âSqueeze Meâ w/ a picture of an orange! :) â¢	Hugged out and went our separate ways.  â¢	I survived! o	Woohoo!  She had to go p/u her parents @ the airport so she was unable to attend Super Size Me. It was too bad because that movie was awesome, insightful, entertaining, and kept your interest the whole time through. BUTâ¦. (aside)   DODGEBALL FRIGGINâ ROCKS!  Go see it. See it 2x. Forget Shrek2, catch it on DVD. Stay to the very end. So after the movie I went home and went to sleep at some absurd time like 11:00.   The Beach  	Woke up the next morning at 6:30am! BEFORE THE SUN! CRAZY! So I made the best of it and decided I was going to go to the Siesta Key. So I went to Siesta Key, stopped and bought myself a folding beach chair and a case of water. Brought along Dickens and my sketchpad and took my 19th century liking self to the beach. Now Mat was staying at one of the condos on the beach, so I took a chance and walked the whole friggin key as far as you could go but didnât see him or his family. This is most likely due to it being before noon and he probably was just waking up. I managed not to burn myself, and returned home in time to catch a quick nap before having to work.   The Day After Tomorrow; Starting At Two Days Ago 	 	So today I spent pondering an appropriate follow up email to send to her in order to try and succeed in creating a 2nd date. After some after-school special conversations with my good buddies (and lunch with Jason) I created and sent it off. We shall see what we shall see when we see it.
