      Today was yet another day of my life. i'm feeling out of reach, it seems to be that i am isolated from everyone around me, maybe because i'm not in school rite now, while everyone else are working their butts off to prepare for the Final Examination, for many it is the last of highschool.   I have no idea what another year of highschool will bring me, the kind of challenges i will face. what i do know is this is my year, this is when my life gets turned around. man, that sure sound exciting! although a lot of focus and determinations will have to take place in order for that to be achieved, i'm sure i will overcome the hard times. To all my friends who are parting to the next stage of their lives:"Watch out! i'm rite behind ya!" lol  I've turned away from God for quite a while now, havn' gone to church in at least 2 or 3 months, i guess i didn' want to communicate, to discuss my sorry ass life. now i'm gradually getting back on track again, guess i might start to go to church again. i also regained my Faith in God, which is AWESOME!  Today I recieved the Dell Notebook my dad ordered, man this is so damn cool, but too bad, my dad is going to take it back to China, and possibly give it to my cousin before he comes back. But i understand, we r going through a critical stage financially, my dad always wanted to give my cousin a computer as a reward and encourgement towards his university journey, i'm glad too.   i wonder wut blake and jing r doing rite now, probably still up studying. Good Luck guys!

      today can be called wonderful.  i woke up late and got into an argument with my dad.  luckily blake called and i dragged him down to the library with me and li.  he did look awesome today.    while li worked away @ algeo, blake and i had yet another serious talk.  this one was past the emotional stuf, we just really looked @ our options.  whenever i thought about blake and his university stuff, i just think about how centred he is.  how absolutely planned his life could be.  and i look @ myself.  i just want to go to UT, and then maybe somewhere down the line, someone could guide into the right path.  nonetheless, i'm content.  i just noe wherever i end up i'll make the best of it.    the way i see it in my head right now.  i'm brinking a long distance relationship.  which is extremely odd for me because i've never had one of those. but the more openly we talked about it.  the better i felt.  we talked about some of the things/feelings we'll experience.  and we both said that if things dunt work out.  we'll be the best of friends.  and haha maybe meet somewhere down the road...oh the endless possibilities.     BUT .  i dun wanna think about us parting now.  especially not after having such a fun day.  after the library we went over to blake's house and played gunbound.  it actually turned out to be an interesting game.  blake heated us dinner and then we went to play basketball.  that was pretty fun.  and  good news !! i didn't run into any weirdos on the subway.  i am thankful.  thankful also for great friends jack, li and other ppl.     most thankful of all for the bestest friend and lover, my BFG.

      so.  i was in the subway trying to get home.  as i was waiting for the training to come.  this old man come up to me and says, "miss, u huv a green worm crawling out of ur pants."  my first reaction was, "WTF!".  anyway.  i turn to look for the "green worm" and finally i found a piece of green grass sticking out of my waistline.  i was thinking..."sheit, i couldn't even see it.  how the F. did u see it."  anyway.  he came back and said, "guess i was mistaking, it was only a piece of grass."  and this is when i came to the conclusion that i...  attract horny, old, persian, black, men.   on a brighter note: i  love  blake luo.   my wrongwrong .    one more thing: jack is awesome for making this blog.  for the 3 musketeers.  haha.

      Bad day, nothing went well 2day  "shut up"  didn' really expect that one, although i could imagine her saying that.  today i look back, and yes, i've made many mistakes in my life, thought i was mature enough to take on the world, truth is, it's way beyond my grasp. i underestimated everything

Today is so cloudy, the weather networks says it's ganna rain in the afternoon.  Today i'm going to confess my love, wonder how will she react:  "uh...ok"(roll eyes) "haha"(laughs) "thank you?"(smiles) "i'm sorrie, i got a boyfriend.." "i love you, too!"(this would be nice to hear) "no..i don' wanna jeopardise our friendship"(unlike her) "let's jus stay friends, ok?"(sigh)  anyways, i guess this is also the fun part of relationships, u'll never know wut the other person ganna say..   good luck to myself today

      I havn' had relationships with a girl in a long long time... mostly because i've lost faith in love, it always turn out to be the opposite of fairytales, guess that's why they called it fairytale in the first place, it's jus an unaccomplishable fantasy.  It's funny how the mind works, sometimes u jus cant control, and the thought of losing control of ur own mind is horrifying... I never had any intension to fall in love again, frankly, i never thought i was able to, but i did. and i don' even know how she feels about me... see, it already made me weak, i cant take my mind off her, i couldn' even sleep for the past two days... Jesus, this sux, why have i fallen in love again??!! my inner struggle

      ...life is so damn miserable  the past just keeps on coming back at u, u think it never stops, and finnally when it seem like it stopped, it jus comes back rite at you again, over and over...  in my younger years, i was a immature kid, love, was something mysterious, something, unknown to me, and probably wrongfully defined by myself...  i met a girl, she was, smart, innocent and pure. and probably also viewed love as a somewhat mysterious thing, searching, and dreaming...  we came together, we talked, and we possibly loved  one day, i did something, something that would hurt her, something that could break her heart  i was not aware what i was doing, i was a immature kid, but i did do it, i was guilty of the action i took, cant deny that part  so she left me, so she was apart from my life..  the shittiest part is that I DID NOT REALIZE HOW DEEP DEEPLY I LOVED HER, I DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH, truth is, i might not have realized i loved her.  if i realized it in time and confessed to her, i might've rescued this relationship... only if i could go back in time and beat the shit out of the younger me and tell him that 'u love her very much and u should confess to her!!'  now, she is so distant from me, she doesn' talk to me, i'm completely out of her life, and it seem like reaching for the moon when i try to get a grasp of her life...it'll never be the same, because i've broken her heart  i know that, i don' deserve her to be with me anymore, all i want, is to b able to communicate with her, care for her, and most of all, protect her...  she was the right girl, at the wrong time...

      Do you not know? Have you not heard?  The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.  He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.  Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;  but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength.  They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary,  they will walk and not be faint.  Isaiah 4o:28-31  These verses are amazingly encouraging, Hallilujah~~~~

      IT'z 1.14am, half asleep, but cant fall asleep, 17 yearz of ups and downs, from a little baby learning how to talk and walk, to the man i am today, it'z been rough, it'z been narrow, it'z been fun. growing up is amazing, one blink of the eyes and the world changes, sometimes i feel like a time traveller, mayb because i'm constanly lost in the concept of time and occationally bounces back into reality and realize a day, a week, a month and even years has been past, it sounds weird and scary, but sometimes that's how it is.   Life, an unpredictable journey, not knowing where you will end up, hope and faith, plus a constant and determined goal is all that's keeping us going forward, along this journey, we will meet some friends, make some enemies, diss some people, be dissed by some people, love and be loved. in the end, we look back, and we will say, that was my life, and i enjoyed it  I'm wondering, what will the world be like without the concept of time. when time does not matter, when ppl can stay in their prime as long as they want, and move on when they feel like it. An old man, a wise man, once told me, the process of growing old is an extraordinary experience. i wonder why.. guess it will only be revealed by actually experiencing this process. "when time does not matter" is that what heaven is like? eternal life, that must mean when the concept of time does not exist. then what do people do in heaven everyday? would it be boring? i mean it would sure be exciting to live by God, but when does it end? what so ever i think God has it all planed right, so no 1 will get bored. another anticipating experience awaits.

      The following content is taken from Family.ca I just had to post it after reading it ------&gt; Radio Free Roscoe Drama Series 2002 Colour 30 MINS C8      Nathan Stephenson, Ali Mukaddam, Kate Todd, Nathan Carter Radio Free Roscoe follows the lives of four diverse and quirky teenagers living in the fictitious suburban town of Roscoe. Determined to pave their way at Henry Roscoe High School, Robbie McGrath, (Nathan Stephenson), Ray Brennan (Ali Mukaddam), Lily Randall (Kate Todd) and Travis Strong (Nathan Carter) launch an anonymous underground radio station where they voice the hopes, fears and confusion of their generation. For these teens, everything is changing way too fast: their bodies, their interests, their friends and the expectations placed on them. It is also a time in their lives when anything seems possible, including falling in love with your best friend, or your worst enemy.  Empowered by the anonymity of their on-air identities, Robbie, Ray, Lily and Travis go from being foot soldiers in high schoolâs âsilent majorityâ to cult heroes whose thoughts and opinions make a difference. During the day, they are trapped in the maze every ninth grader faces, but after school they only have to flip a switch and their fears of not saying the right thing, not wearing the right thing, not being the right thing all disappear. Their radio show gives them the freedom to play the type of music they want to hear and talk about the topics that are important in their lives. It is also a place to laugh at life and sometimes themselves. Whether itâs a satirical look at life at Henry Roscoe High or a cutting impersonation of their Principal, these kids know that comedy can sometimes reach the most sceptical of audiences.   Their daily radio show, called âRadio Free Roscoe,â is free from advertising, free from hype, free from hypocrisy, it is the place where these amateur DJâs find their own identity. Daily, they meet head-on the stress of conforming to a crowd that demands that they be like everyone else: Radio Free Roscoe is about being a teenager, growing up and knowing youâre not alone.

       "It's all you'll ever hear: Look like this, think like this, be like this, how do you fight it? we started our own radio station. We keep our identities secrete, it gives us the power to say what we want, as loud as we want."  This is the intro to the TV show "Radio Free Roscoe" i recently discovered This is by far the most relative and meaningful TV show i've encountered. It actually has a very good depict of the modern teenagers' highschool life, trying to fit in, peer pressure, crushes between friends, confessions, rejections, broken hearts, understandable friends, you name it.   Basically, there are 4 students, 3 guys and 1 girl, 2 guys and 1 girl have been the best of friends since they were little, and there is the new/silent/mysterious/smart/cool guy. They felt the need for their voice to be heard, and peer pressure is crushing in, so they lauched an underground radio station where they voice the hopes, fears and confusion of our generation.  It's a great show and i enjoy watching it, if you are interested, tune in Family, weeknights 7:30pm and Midnight, Radio Free Roscoe  For more information, please visit: http://www.family.ca/

      I made a mark on my arm last night, as a reminder of the things i shouldn't have done in the past, a recent event, and to remind myself to study hard, i needed some physical pain.   I surprised myself, wonder since when did I turn so psychopathic...  Frankly, this was not a bad experience, it gave me a better understanding of life, though it was way less fatal than a suicide cut, it took a lot of courage to make the cut, especially when i chose the wrong knife...  First i rubbed on some antibiotics, to make sure i don't get an infection afterwards.  The knife i chose was a really bad knife, it's a peeling knife for fruits and vegetables. when i was choosing between a meat cutting knife and this one, i thought, it's knife, any of them should cut, and the meat cutting knife apeared to be very scary, so i chose the other, which was a bad choice. When i finally had enough courage to slice, the knife wouldn' cut, i had to cut 4 or 5 times, in the end, i closed my eyes and used all my strength to make the cut till the point i was sweating.  At the point there wasn't much blood, and i didn' feel much pain either, maybe because i was pretty tense at the time.  After a few minutes, i felt a bit sick, so i lied in my bed, then i started to shake for some reason..  After this experience, I gained better understanding of the people who commits suicide by cutting their vines. Although commiting suitcide itself is an act of foolishness and weakness, but people who died by cutting their wrist must took an increditable amout of courage and determination, they must've been through a lot of pain and sufferings in their lives, to the point where to die is better than to live.  I don't encourage anyone to do what i did, but if for wutever reason u decided to to this, here are some tips: 1. choose a really sharp knife 2. close your eyes when u do the cut

      Yesterday I watched 'The day after tomorrow', it was a movie that depicts how fragile and insignificant us human are. Also it's a remainder for us, that we shouldn't pollute the Earth as if there is no concenquence.  Troy, awesome movie, one of the best ancient war movies ever produced. It depicts Achilles, an arrogant, rebellious and seemingly invincible warrior who was doomed to fall in the pursuition for love.

      (A short essay I wrote in Grade 9 English)  What's Love? It's like the wind, no one knows when it comes, and no one could predict when it's leaving. When it comes, you can not hide from it, when it leaves you can not stop it... Love itself is precious and sweet, when two are in love, they care about each other, they adore each other for who they are, they would do whatever it takes to make one of the other happy, even death couldn't stop love, but sometimes love can be tough... Especially when its left you, you'll feel alone and lost, you'll find yourself lying upon the ground, and searching for an answer you can never find - 'why?'   There are plenty of love stories, and you can see there's something in common, most of them ends up with sadness and broken hearts... The one I'm about to introduce began in the summer of 1999...   Chris, a handsome 15 years old teenager whose parents got divorced when he was 12, lived with his father since. Chris likes to play basketball, soccer, swimming and rollerblading ect. An all round athlete type of boy.   This summer, Chris decided to spend his summer break back in his hometown - Wilstead. One day, Chris was swimming in the lake, enjoying the beauty of nature; he saw a girl surfing, looks like she's a beginner, because her movement is not very smooth. Chris was shocked, because he can see a big wave coming at the girl, and she was surfing in the restricted area because there are rocks all around. Suddenly, the big wave hit the girl, she fell into the water...   Chris knows that the girl couldn't take the big wave, so he swam over to rescue her... When he got there, the girl was drowning, and her head hit on a rock ended up unconscious. Chris took her home, put medicine on her wound spot, and let her rest, fortunately, its just skin, the rock did not damage the bones.   For a while, Chris was totally attracted by thebeauty of the girl, she looked like an angel, with blond hair, godly face...   The second day morning, the girl woke up; Chris told her what had happened to her, she said thank you, but started to cry...   The girl's name is Jennifer, earlier yesterday her boyfriend had broke up with her because he was in love with someone else, she was very sad, didn't know what to do, so she went to surf... She was going to choose death, so didn't care about the big wave, but now Chris rescued her, she doesn't know what to do or say...   "What's wrong? Why are you crying? What's your name?" asked Chris.   "I'm Jennifer, my boyfriend just left me yesterday, I didn't know what to do, so..." Answered Jennifer.   "Oh... I see. Well, same thing had happened to me too, but I have learned to deal with it." said Chris.   "But... Ouch..." Her head started to hurt, so Chris helped her to lie down to rest.   For the next two weeks, Chris took care of Jennifer, eventually they have built undeniable friendship, both of them have fell in love with each other!   Chris and Jennifer started dating, they have taken care of each other very well, both of them never felt like that for anyone before, is this faith? Are they meant to be together? Until late that summer, both of them know that their holidays are about to end, both of them are going back to where they came from... How are they going to do that? Live without their loved ones, is that a possible thing to do?   Chris decided that for now, they will go back to where they belong, and next summer, both of them will try to move to Wilstead and go to school there, so both of them left with hope.   During the year, they have e-mailed each other very often, talked on the phone a lot too, everything seem to be fine, until one day...   Chris was planning to go see Jennifer during Christmas holidays, his phone rang...   "Hello?"   "Chris, it's Jennifer, I think that we haven't see each other for too long..."   "I know, I'm planning to come over during Christmas Holidays!" Chris said instantly.   "No, I mean, we haven't seen each other for a long time now, things don't seem to be working out between us, because of many problems."   "What do you mean?"   "Don't you understand? Anyways, I'm in love with this other boy, his really cute, and you know? I'm sorry, because we haven't seen each other for too long, I don't think thing swill work out between us..."   "...You mean you want to break up with me now? After all that we have been through you want to end this?"   "Well, basically, yes."   "But.."   Jennifer hung up the phone before Chris could finish his sentence...   That's about the end of the story, you see? That's when love left Chris, was that predictable? No, it wasn't. In a way, the love you get is never free, if you had too much love at once, you will end up bad, like one of the phrase said - The higher you climb, the harder you fall.

      these days are crazy~~~ I havn't really studied much, most of the time i went out with my friends and chill, i made a lot of friends during this past week, but most of them are over 20 years old.    In Toronto, there is not much night life, because most of the stores closes at around 9 o'clock, after 10, or 11pm, there's so little ppl on the streets.    But that doesn't mean there is no night life, if you have a bunch of friends, you can go to the bar and have some drinks, go to the kareoke to sing some songs, go to the clubs to dance, or go bowling, play pool and so on.    for me, i'm only 17, it's considered under age, so i could not go to the bar, kareoke or go to the clubs, those are for people who are 19+.    so these past few days i've been out with a bunch of friends, have BBQs, or go out and eat, we usually eat from 9 to 12, lol, ya, because we were chatting formost of the time. then we go play some pool, then go home.    so my mom's kinda pissed at me because i come home after 1 or 2am everyday.    gottado some studying...

      Life is rough, thus i have to be tough, tears are worthless, a sign of weakness In order to protect myself, i have to arm myself with heavey armors, and stone helmets  Where am I? Who am I? These days has been cruel, I havsn't been able to show my feelings to anyone in the longest time.  I feel all my friends are so far away from me, no one understands me, what's the point of showing the real me, it'll only ruin their happy days.  Friends say they are always there, up and downs, happy or sad. but who really wants to know other people's problems? Everyone got their own to deal with. The world is frustrating, not for me, but for all of us. In the end, we are all worn out, without a vision, without any hopes The armors gets heavier every moment you live, soon no one knows who you really are, cuz you are covered up in a blob of armor which you called protection..  i find myself with many facades, the true self is a stranger even to me. who are you jack? I don' know, who am i?

      Everything we do, everything we don't do, it all relates back to decisions.  We are constantly making decisions, everyday, every minute, even every second of our lives. When should I get up today? What should I eat for breakfast? What should I wear today? Who should I talk to?  our future depends on these little decisions that we are constantly making, one can say your life has been planed out by God, every step of the way was meant to be. Others say that you make your own future, the decisions you make forms your future bit by bit.  I don't know if any of you has watched The Butterfly Effect. It's about a guy who can go back in time, every time he goes back, he changes something, and his whole future resulted in a completely different way.  For every action taken, their will be a reaction, that's one of the most common laws of Physics. Many say it is the same with things you do in life, every action will result in a reaction. But I'd like to challenge that. I think many actions taken will result in various reactions. Short term reaction, and long term reaction.  For example, if a boy's father treated him badly when he was a kid, abused him, constantly being angry at him. The short time reaction would be, the kid might cry at the moment due to the abuse, he might start to fear his father, or become mentally ill. What's the long term reaction? The kid grows up, got married, had kids, he would probably treat his son the same way his father did him. Because he automatically perceives that's the way to solve that problem, because that's what his father did.  Every decision we make might directly or indirectly influence our future. Should I take that job? Should I be friends with that guy/women?  so people, make your decisions wisely :)
