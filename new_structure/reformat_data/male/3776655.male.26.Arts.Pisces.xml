      First of all, I created this website in Word. Kind of fitting, seeing how Iâm Ed âwordâ Price, huh? Hahahahaâ¦ Whooâ¦ Iâm funny.  Anyway, this really isnât that complicated. I realized that frames are often a pain. Why create a website using FrontPage or DreamWeaver (note that Microsoft programs donât recognize the spilling of DreamWeaver, but FrontPage is okay) when you arenât using frames?   You merely setup your first Word page as your index. You create your ânon-moving frames,â or sections of your website using cells. The column on the left is merely a cell. I could have a column on the right for images or advertisements. I could also paste an image below the text.   In addition, you could set a link to an image in its own browser.  You merely click on your cell with the right mouse smacker, choose âborders and shading,â and go nuts.  Plus, you highlight, right click, and pick hyperlink to link stuff. You can open things in new windows, generate screen tips, and more.  Hereâs the point: You donât need anything but Word to create a website, unless you like background images and frames (both of which can become limiting and distracting. The only negative is that you will do a bunch of copy pasting when you change your main menu (which is on our left).  Hereâs another random Word tip: To add headers and footers, click on View â Headers and Footers.   Tomorrow: The Website Part 2.  â Ed âwordâ Price

      I was sending out my  urlLink  EDitorials   to my friends to get feedback. One of them, Ben Morrell, made a comment that I should turn it into a blog. He offered to help me set up a website.   Well, a blog defeated the purpose, because I wanted to make a business out of it. However, I soon realized that  urlLink a website  was the way to go. I could advertise my  urlLink EDitorials  and build my online empire. Seeing how Iâve created websites professionally, I decided to tackle the project on my own. (Ben is a former student of mine. I think Iâve had him in one summer Bible study his senior year when I was his high school youth leader.) Benâs been a great friend over the years (vicious and wicked pun is highly intended).   And then I was having dinner with Brad Abrams on Sunday, June 27. I was telling him how I was creating this website to market my  urlLink EDitorials . Brad broke it down and said that I was basically pitching something to people, asking them if it would fit in with their audiences. He thought that it would be much more valuable to create a blog, build an audience, and then turn it over to a publisher and say, âHereâs my product and my audience. Will it fit in with your media?â That made me think. He had a great point. So, thus is bornâ¦  The EDible B.L.O.G.  I wonât bother you with very many details and nuances with my life (i.e. âI got a haircut todayâ). (Does anyone know what i.e. stands for and the history of the word?) . Instead, Iâll concentrate on my thoughts on life, the things Iâve created in this life, and the things Iâve learned in this life. Prepare for randomness, humor, and information that you most likely will regret possessing the knowledge of.   Tomorrow: The Website.  â Ed âwordâ Price  Blogger Note: This is merely a reposting of my blogsite, which is  urlLink  www.wwwdotcomedy.com  . Basically meaning that my blogs will be written there. I will occasionally post them up here as well, possibly in spurts. So they aren't truly up to date. Of course, I'd recommend cheking them out on my site, so you can get them when they are written; also, I've got The Weakly EDitorial up (and more is coming), so my site will entertain you thoroughly (or at least inflict you with agonizing pain, which is still funny to me).
