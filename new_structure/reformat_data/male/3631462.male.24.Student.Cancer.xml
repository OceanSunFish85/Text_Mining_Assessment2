      CHAPTER 18   [Nickyâs P.O.V.]   *26th August*   [96 Days to Go]   I woke up feeling groggy in the morningâ¦Lazily I slumped my body towards the kitchen.   Walking past Benâs room I noticed he wasnât in bedâ¦.hmmâ¦thatâs interesting, for once he actually got up early or maybe I just got up lateâ¦*sigh*â¦   Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I slouched on the chair and sat for a while listening to my own breathingâ¦it seemed so quiteâ¦oddâ¦   Scratching my head in concentration I began to think of possible solutions to as why the house was so quite, I wonder where Ben is, I still need to get him back for the last trick he pulledâ¦urgh!...   My mind raced with images of the other day, I had to admit though Ben was a darn good actorâ¦*sigh*â¦   I sighed heavily and motioned towards the kitchen to fix something to eat, there was a note on the benchâ¦   âGone out to work. -Benâ   Upon reading it my eyes bulged and my mind raced with thoughtsâ¦Ben had a job?! I wonder what he did. Was it a professional job?   Wowâ¦   I stood in silence taking it all inâ¦flabbergasted; I didnât realize the knock on the doorâ¦   âHello?! Ben! Open up!â I heard a voice call from the other side.   Snapping out of my thoughts I gathered my senses and briskly  walked towards the doorâ¦   *knock, knock, knock, Bang, Bang, Bang!*   âBennie? You in there?â The male voice asked again.   My eyebrow jerked upâ¦Bennie?.. What the hell? Was that Benâs nickname?..   My mouth curved into a slight grin as I realized who was knocking on the doorâ¦must be Benâs friendâ¦I could gather information and use it against Ben if he ever tried anything stupidâ¦hmmâ¦interestingâ¦   I unfastened the locks followed by a âclickâ and opened the door for the stranger without hesitationâ¦   I recognized the man instantly from Crystal Bar, he was one of   Benâs friends I had seen when he got me fired.   His features were quite girlish but cute in a wayâ¦his broad shoulders and attire distinctively showed that he was a guy and his skin was like porcelainâ¦*sigh*â¦he even had better skin than meâ¦   âUhhâ¦hiâ¦who are you?â The guy asked before chuckling nervously.   I gave out a sigh of relief secretly after realizing he didnât recognize meâ¦   âUmm....Iâmâ¦Nicky, Benâs friend, who are you?â I answered him reluctantlyâ¦   âOh, Iâm Jake, Benâs friend as wellâ he stated while laughing light-heartedly.   He seemed like a pretty decent guyâ¦hmmâ¦I wouldnât mind getting to know him, as long as he wasnât as pig-headed as Benâ¦*sigh*â¦he could turn out handy as wellâ¦   âOhhâ¦â I expressed.   Jake stood at the door like an idiot fidgeting with his handsâ¦I guess the tension was pretty thickâ¦   âBenâs not home right nowâ¦did you want to come in?â I spoke, deciding to break the silence firstâ¦   âOhâ¦okayâ¦umm nah I donât want trouble youâ he answered politelyâ¦   âOhâ¦itâs no trouble at all!â I protested in a sugary sweet toneâ¦   âUmmâ¦okay then, sureâ he replied smiling at meâ¦   I lead him into the house and poured each of us a cup of coffee before settling down to talkâ¦   Turned out that Jake was a pretty cool guyâ¦he was funny, easy going and down to earthâ¦nothing like Benâ¦sheeshâ¦no idea how they became such good friends, they have nothing in common at allâ¦besides the fact that theyâre both quite cuteâ¦   Hmmâ¦letâs seeâ¦   Jake is Intelligent; Ben is slow and dim-wittedâ¦  Jake is funny; Ben is naturally stupid and annoyingâ¦   Jake is polite; Ben is pig-headed and arrogantâ¦  Jake is easy going and respects women; Ben is un-gentlemen like and disrespectfulâ¦  Jake is decent; Ben is just plain cheap!   *sigh*â¦the list just goes on!   By the time I was finished with talking to Jake I managed to gather some dirt on Benâ¦   1. Ben used to have a pot-head haircut [Iâd like to see that one!]  2. He was dumped by a girl when he was 16 [Heâll never live it downâ¦HauaHaha]  3. He has a little sister called Ice  4. He hates being called Consti-Ben [No idea whyâ¦what does the âConstiâ part mean? Hmmâ¦]  5. His weakness is money and girls  6. Looks are everything to him  7. He hates the color pink.  8. He keeps a teddy bear in his room but is embarrassed about it because he says itâs not masculine.  9. Gets jealous easy if he sees a hot chick with a good-looking guy.  10. He loves to show off about everything and he is quite big-headed [Jake didnât tell me that oneâ¦I figured it out for myselfâ¦]  11. He has an imaginary fan clubâ¦ [Figured that one out myself too]   I wrote the info down on a piece of paper and stashed it in my room for further useâ¦maybe I could add to itâ¦hmmâ¦I sneer formed on my face as I thought of how I could use everything I had discovered against Benâ¦I got busy and conjured up some notes to remind myselfâ¦My first memo wasâ¦   â¢ Use everything against himâ¦    CHAPTER 19   [Benâs P.O.V.]   *27th August*  [95 Days to Go]   Yesterday I went to work as usualâ¦when I came back Nicky was cooking dinnerâ¦My heart skipped a beat when we exchanged glancesâ¦   She smiled at me innocentlyâ¦was she up to something? My mind raced with thoughts and suspicion...I didnât want to experience her vile ways of getting back at me againâ¦I imagined what it would be this timeâ¦hmmâ¦   âSit down Benâ she had said flatly.   I reluctantly took a seat near the table and waited for the dishes to arriveâ¦when we had finally settled in I stared at her face searching for a little hint of suspicionâ¦nothingâ¦   Slowly I picked my chopsticks up and reached for the beansâ¦I drew my hand away as I neared them remembering last times incident [Didnât want that happening again]. Changing my mind I went for the fishâ¦hopefully there was no poison in thereâ¦*sigh*â¦   Beads of sweat dripped from my forehead as my hand shakily clamped a piece of fish in the chopsticksâ¦nearing my mouth I took a quick glance at Nicky making sure nothing funny was going to happenâ¦   She remained calm and ate busily in silence not even glancing my wayâ¦slowly the fish entered my mouth and I rolled it around with my tongue while my eyes were closed tightly shut in anticipation, waiting for the hurtful blow to come my way, surprisingly enoughâ¦it was fine!   My heart beat slowed down and I began to eat without hesitationâ¦  Lying in bed in my baby blue PJâs, I stared at the ceiling wondering why she hadnât put rat poisoning in the foodâ¦then I glanced at my clock and remembered workâ¦   It was always 9.30am till 4.30pmâ¦all I did was sit in my office and answer a couple phone calls and sign a few papersâ¦   Iâve been working at B Corporations for quite a while now, Rainer introduced me to his adopted fatherâs companyâ¦Iâm the Chief Executiveâs assistant, but I hardly do anything all day because Rainerâs adopted brother, Derek takes his job so seriously!...   Thatâs a good thing though, I tend to sleep around and watch TV in my office a lotâ¦did I mention I had a TV in my office? Well if I didnât, I do, and itâs great! Itâs just like being at home except I donât have to pay for the electricity bills and I get paid too!   Thanks to Derek and Rainer, I have the perfect jobâ¦.*sigh*â¦.life would be so perfect if Nicky wasnât around and if the stupid bold patch and bruises on my face would go awayâ¦   Oh wellsâ¦no point dreamingâ¦or Iâll be late for work againâ¦glancing at my clock it was 8:24amâ¦I jumped out of bed and set   Mr. Patchy [My Teddy Bear] to the sideâ¦   âBye Patchyâ I cooed at him.   His animated face stared back at meâ¦*sigh*â¦it was his way of saying goodbyeâ¦I nodded my head at himâ¦we had an unspoken understandingâ¦   As usual I performed my usual routineâ¦after stuffing my face with a quick breakfast and throwing on my suit I headed to the bathroom for my usual one hour facial assessmentâ¦   Clean shave? Check.   Neat hair? Checkâ¦oh no, hold onâ¦   I picked up a comb lying on the bathroom sink and gently combed my hair fondly and styled it with some gelâ¦   After a few excruciating moments I inspected my fine workâ¦tilting my head from side to side and slanting this way and that  I inspected every angle to make sure not a strand of hair was out of placeâ¦   Managing to have covered my bold patch with some hair, my eyes glistened with prideâ¦ Ben, youâve solved another dilemma!   Back to my check listâ¦   Clean shave? Check.   Neat hair? Yup, yup, yup!   Good Facial complexion?   I leaned in closely to see the faint bruises that were caused by Nickyâs vicious, brutal actsâ¦hmmâ¦they were getting less clear, but still visible to the naked eyeâ¦   I rummaged through the cupboard behind the mirror to find something to hide the bruisesâ¦.I didnât have time yesterday so everybody could see the embarrassing bruisesâ¦   Surprisingly, no one mentioned it! Not even Derek who had the biggest and boldest mouth ever along with Jakeâ¦but I havenât seen Jake latelyâ¦   Picking up a small tub of lotion I peered at the inscriptionâ¦   âFoundation-For women who know themselvesâ   What the heck does that mean? I pondered for a whileâ¦Foundation?   Since when did I own thisâ¦and it was for women too!   For a factâ¦I would like to state that I, Benjamin Uy am 100% man! And I will NEVER be known as a man who owns a womanâs facial cream!   I puffed out my chest in the mirror with my reflection gazing back at meâ¦now THIS was the Ben I knew! My eyes stared fondly at the dead, sexy male staring at meâ¦who else could it be but ME!  *sigh*â¦My fans have got excellent taste if they like me so muchâ¦no, not like, loveâ¦they worship meâ¦.   The same, old, familiar saying popped back up into my headâ¦   I, Ben, am literally a chick magnetâ¦   Feeling good about myself I decided that either way women would love meâ¦but I still had to do something about the bruisesâ¦  *sigh*â¦   I stood in thought for a few moments wondering how to cover up the stupid bruises done my Nickyâs vicious felonies [As I liked to call them]   My eyes gazed around the room and fell on the Foundation â¦hmmâ¦maybe I couldâ¦.butâ¦.no I canât do that! Its girls stuff! But stillâ¦   I debated against my conscious over and over againâ¦saying it was wrong to apply womenâs make up onâ¦but it was alright in desperate measuresâ¦*sigh*â¦   The result was very confusingâ¦I glanced at my watch and my eyes bulged out of my socketsâ¦ 9:20amâ¦if I didnât leave right now Iâd be late for workâ¦.Derek wouldnât be very happy eitherâ¦he loves to give me lectures about coming on time and taking my work seriouslyâ¦*sigh*â¦   I decided to take a chance and I pampered my face with the stuffâ¦after a few coughs I gave a quick glance at the mirror to make sure nothing drastic had happenedâ¦surprisingly enough everything was fineâ¦and better! The bruises werenât there anymore!   Forming a bright smile on my face I grabbed my suitcase and raced out of my apartment, down the stairs and towards my carâ¦    CHAPTER 20  [Benâs P.O.V.]   *27th August*   [At the Office]   âMorning Mr. Uyâ the secretary, Miss Tolentino smiled brightly at meâ¦   I gave her a wink, my usual greetingâ¦   âMorning Sirâ another female colleague spoke as I sauntered past her looking cool and sexy.   I gave out another wink.   *sigh*â¦I had a feeling that today was going to be a good dayâ¦I had managed to cover up the embarrassing bruises and bold patch  I had from Nickyâs feloniesâ¦   As I reached my office, Miss Javier another of my colleagues gave me a flirtatious winkâ¦   âHi Mr. Uyâ¦â she cooed while deliberately moving her hips from side to side in an attempt to seduce meâ¦   I stared at her in wondermentâ¦she really knew how to work a guyâ¦but not meâ¦no, no, noâ¦I donât date colleaguesâ¦if I could I wouldâ¦but Derek strictly forbid me to go near any of his workersâ¦he said it could lead to complications..*sigh*â¦   I winked at Miss Javier like I did with the other girls before entering my office and closing the doorâ¦   Settling down my briefcase I slumped onto my lazy boy chair and stared out at my window viewâ¦I had one of the big offices in the building with a large scenery view of Makati City. Seeing as how Derek and I were good friends, I had some privilegesâ¦but not as many as him, since he is the bossâs sonâ¦*sigh*â¦   I still donât understand why Derek wanted to work as a minor when he first began and then make his way to the top when he could start out as the C.E.O. at the startâ¦   I questioned him once and he answered with the most pointless wordsâ¦   âI donât want to cheat my way in lifeâ¦a good boss is one who knows his people and positionâ¦not one who knows money and powerâ¦â he had informed meâ¦   I still donât get what he meant by thatâ¦and I donât think I ever willâ¦scratching my head in confusion I opened my desk drawer and pulled out the remote for the TV.   Aimlessly I flicked the channels with nothing in particular to watchâ¦anxiously, I waited checked my watch constantly while beads of sweat dripped down my foreheadâ¦   I loosened my tie awaiting my desired momentâ¦Breathing in and out loudly I closed my eyes and listened to the shuffling of paper work and the repetitive ringing of office phones waiting to be answeredâ¦   A grumbling noise was heard every so oftenâ¦beads of sweat dripped from my forehead as I cringed in anxiety with my eyebrows curved in an archâ¦   *Beep Beep*   âLunch Break, I repeat, Lunch Breakâ   *Beep Beep*   I let out a long sigh of relief as I heard the all too familiar words coming out of the office speakers I longed to hear throughout the day...yum! Lunch Break!!! My favorite time of the day when I was working!   The grumbling was becoming unbearable through the grueling hours stuck in a stuffy office and listening to the sounds of workers busily walking around the building while shouting across the room for signatures to be signed and meetings to be heldâ¦   Donât get me wrong, I donât mind working hereâ¦itâs great! Derek is here and sometimes Rainer pops by to say hiâ¦thatâs why I like working hereâ¦the people are friendly and I have friends here too. Not to mention I donât have to hold a lot of responsibility because Derek likes to do his job properly and without faultâ¦he doesnât like to laze around, heâs such a robot sometimesâ¦*sigh*â¦   I guess he really takes the whole business thing serious seeing as how when his dad retires he is expected to carry on working here and maintain the company standard along with Rainerâ¦but Rainer doesnât really show up a lotâ¦   I hastily walked to the cafeteria and picked up a food tray before lining up to be servedâ¦I love foodâ¦*sigh*â¦not to mention itâs free here!   I have to admit Iâm a cheapoâ¦but hey? Who WOULD want to part with money? Besides now that Nicky is going to live with me forâ¦100â¦noâ¦98?...noâ¦96 daysâ¦yeah, thatâs rightâ¦96 daysâ¦I need more money to support herâ¦so I have to show up for work moreâ¦   I pondered for a while thinking about money and the problems that come with itâ¦   Then I remembered Derekâ¦he was probably inside his office being a workaholic as usualâ¦he rarely comes out to eatâ¦   Deciding to get him something to eat I told the worker behind me to save my spot and I sprinted to the back and got another tray for Derekâ¦   When I got back it was my turn to be servedâ¦after giving a bow and saying a polite thank you I piled the two trays with foodâ¦   âLet me guessâ¦for Derek?â Mrs. Jang asked me with a jolly smile plastered on her face while her rosy cheeks shone in the cafeteria.   I nodded my head as an answer while smiling at herâ¦   She was one of the many cooks at B corporations and she was great! Her food was so delicious and scrumptious!*sigh*â¦yummy!   âHave Fun Benâ she called out to me.   I gave her a nod and a smile while I headed out of the cafeteria and towards Derekâs officeâ¦   Derekâs office was a door away from mineâ¦Miss Javier was in-between usâ¦   When I finally reached his office door I encountered another dilemmaâ¦how am I going to knock on the door? Both my hands are full by carrying both of the traysâ¦   I winced in confusion trying to find another solutionâ¦I considered kicking the door open but that wouldnât be very friendlyâ¦especially if Derek was talking to his dadâ¦not to mention the BOSS of B corporationsâ¦*sigh*â¦   I had an urge to scratch my head like I always did when I was in thoughtâ¦   After a few moments I came up with a few solutionsâ¦   1. Kick the door open.  2. Shout out to Derek to open the door.  3. Ram my way in  4. Knock on the door with my head   I pondered for a while wondering which one was best suitable for the situationâ¦my tummy was beginning to grumble again and I was stressing over a little problem..*sigh*â¦   I settled upon knocking on the door with my headâ¦   Here goes nothingâ¦*sigh*â¦   *Knock, Knock, Knock*   âWho is it?â Derek asked from the other side.   âItâs meâ¦Benâ I called out.   I heard the shuffle of papers and the sound of footsteps approaching the doorâ¦then the door clicked openâ¦   Derekâs eyebrow jerked up at me with a questioning lookâ¦   âHereâs yoursâ I told him while shoving a tray towards his chestâ¦   After a few moments of Derek staring at his tray dumbfounded he took hold of the sides and said thanks before letting me in and walking back to his seatâ¦   We sat in silence and ate out lunchâ¦he seemed to be in deep thought, while I stared in space with nothing in particular in mindâ¦I figured he was probably thinking of the merge of his company with other corporations or somethingâ¦   Although Derek was older than Rainer and they werenât related at all, besides the fact that they treated each other as brothers because Derekâs Dad had adopted Rainerâ¦they had a shocking resemblance to each otherâ¦   When I first met them I couldnât tell them apart at allâ¦everything was exactly identical, there blonde streaked hair and facial features, their personalities and even the way they dressedâ¦   But as the years progressed Rainer became more distant after an incident with his girlfriend Eugeneâ¦at least I THINK it was his girlfriendâ¦he never gave us much detailsâ¦just rambled on about the afterlife, reincarnation and stuff like thatâ¦   Derek didnât changeâ¦his personality is still laid-back but serious when it comes to decisions about the futureâ¦but he still has time to joke around and stuffâ¦   Rainer is always serious nowadaysâ¦you hardly see him crack a smile or a jokeâ¦   âHow did you knock on the door if you were holding both of the trays in your hands?â Derek asked me seemingly interested.   âUse my head of courseâ I answered him while forming a grin on my face feeling proud of my solutionâ¦   So much for acting smartâ¦Derek shot me another questioning look...*sigh*â¦   âThought soâ¦.I knew you wouldnât of thought of something simplerâ Derek shook his head and sighed loudly in defeat as if he could never figure me outâ¦   I stared at him in confusionâ¦   âWhat do you mean by that?â I persisted curiously.   âWellâ¦you couldâve just set the trays down on the tableâ¦instead of banging your head on my doorâ Derek contradicted while taking a gulp of his Ramen noodles casually.   I gave him a dirty look and dropped the subject knowing Derek was rightâ¦   He laughed it off and shook his head at meâ¦   âWhatâs that on your hair?â Derek asked me in wonderment.   âItâs called G-E-Lâ I retorted feeling smart that I had came up with a come back.   âI know that you idiot!â Derek said defensively followed by a push on my forehead.   I groaned loudly while continuing to eatâ¦   Derek gave out little sniffsâ¦   *sniff, sniff* *sniff, sniff*   I glanced up to see what Derek was doingâ¦he kept sniffing his handâ¦   âWhat are you doing?â I asked him.   He ignored my question and touched the side of my cheek and ran his index finger across my jaw bone as if he was smudging off some dirt or somethingâ¦   I gave him a weird lookâ¦   âWhatâs with you?â I said while tilting my head along with  Derekâs movements.   Again, he sniffed his hand and rubbed his fingers togetherâ¦   âIsâ¦that, Foundation?â Derek asked me, giving me his full attentionâ¦   My heart skipped a beatâ¦how did HE know? My cheeks felt hot as my heart beat rapidly increasedâ¦how embarrassingâ¦   I gave out a nervous chuckle trying to ease the tensionâ¦   âDonât be stupid Derekâ¦only GIRLS were foundation...I mean, COME ON would you ever catch MEâ¦Godâs gift to Women wearing Foundation?!â I asked him while giving out a nervous snort.   Derek stared at me with a weird lookâ¦   I could feel my cheeks heating up while I looked around the room trying to avoid his gazeâ¦after what seemed like forever Derek shrugged his shoulders and took another gulp full of noodlesâ¦   I let out a secret sigh of relief while I silently ate my noodlesâ¦   That was lucky!   I got home that day tired and exhausted even though I hadnât really done anything all dayâ¦but hey? Nicky didnât know that so she wouldnât have to annoy me with being lazy now that she knew that I actually had a job.   She couldnât say much either since she was a former bar-girl a couple days agoâ¦   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      CHAPTER 16  [Benâs P.O.V.]  *25 August*  [97 Days to Go]  I woke up at 9.30am and lay in bed with my arms crossed behind my head while staring at the ceilingâ¦  Thinking back I realized that ever since Nicky came my life has turned upside downâ¦Iâve only been with her for 2 daysâ¦today is the 3rd dayâ¦*sigh*â¦thanks to sleep it cuts the long hours downâ¦  I cringed as I thought about last nights eventsâ¦.I actually thought that she had forgiven me already and was being nice and feminine for a changeâ¦obviously I was wrong, after that Super Chili Powderâ¦.  As I laid in bed I began to feel a stabbing, sour sensation in the pit of my stomachâ¦.I lay still trying to find out what type of cramp I was havingâ¦My eyes bulged then narrowed as my nose twitched and my mouth jerked from side to side in wondermentâ¦  Thatâs when it dawned on meâ¦whereâs the TOILET?!!!!!  I jumped out of bed and desperately opened my door before jolting to the toiletâ¦  When I was finished I gave out a sigh of relief and exited the toiletâ¦  âThose packets of chili powder sure do wonders!â I said with a whistle and a sighâ¦WoW!  I patted my stomach and headed towards the kitchen in search of something to eatâ¦  âAwwwâ¦shit! Who died in HERE?â I heard Nickyâs disgusted voice as she entered the toilet.  Ignoring her rude comment I continued to walk to the fridge while yawning sleepilyâ¦  Rummaging around I found some milk and cereal lying around somewhereâ¦busily I dug into my breakfast, narrowing my eyes to see how many smiley faces I could find in my cerealâ¦there sure were a lotâ¦Iâve never seen so many smiley facesâ¦  I gazed in wonderment while busily munching away on my cerealâ¦  âWhat are you doing Ben?â Nicky asked me with her voice that made me feel like she was accusing me and saying that I was doing something stupidâ¦  I pondered for a whileâ¦come to think of itâ¦she always speaks to me in that toneâ¦hmm...  I shrugged off the idea while busily munching awayâ¦  âCounting how many smiley faces I can find in my cerealâ I answered casually not bothering to look up at herâ¦  âIdiotâ she mumbled  *Whack!*  I gave out an exasperated groan after she hit the back of my headâ¦  âWhat was THAT for?â I asked her annoyed that she had made me lose concentrationâ¦I was up to 31 smiley facesâ¦  âYou idiotâ¦theyâre all smiley faces!â she said sounding impatientâ¦  What was HER problemâ¦she was the one who made me get the runsâ¦if you know what I meanâ¦and she got the last laugh when she didnât HESITATE at all to pour all THREE of those chili powder packs into the stupid beansâ¦*sigh*â¦  âHow do YOU know that theyâre all smiley faces?!â I counter attacked herâ¦  She gave out a hopeless groanâ¦*sigh*â¦she wasnât a very good actorâ¦she only pretended to be angryâ¦I knew so, why you may ask? Well simple. I know all girlsâ¦secretly sheâs actually dying to kiss meâ¦  âYou Bimbo! Read the cereal box!â she spat out desperately trying to get a point throughâ¦  âFine then!â I retorted making sure I rolled my eyes in front of her faceâ¦  What was HER problemâ¦sheeshâ¦sheâs just going to make a fool of herselfâ¦  I picked up the cereal box with my hand while the other was clutching onto my spoonâ¦giving her a nasty look I picked it up while munching the cereal bits in my mouthâ¦  âSmiley-Oâsâ I read out loudly so she could hearâ¦  âYeahâ¦so?â I asked her dumbfounded.  âRead the bottom you idiot!â she said again before folding her arms and doing MY poseâ¦the one I called âThe Cool Poseâ  I did as I was told and obeyed like a little boyâ¦  âSmiley-Oâsâ¦Smile, coz every single Smiley is always smiling back at you!â I mumbled while skimming through the wordsâ¦  I looked up at Nicky dumbfoundedâ¦was she trying to make a point again?...what was her problem?...here I was minding my own business trying to count how many Smiley faces I could find in my cereal and she hits me on the head for no apparent reasonâ¦honestly the brain of this girl is seriously damaged!  Again, she let out a defeated groan before walking awayâ¦ I stared at her turning figure as she went to retrieve the milk from the fridgeâ¦  Shrugging off the incident I returned to busily counting how many smiley faces there could be in my cerealâ¦1â¦2â¦.3â¦.4â¦.  âWhere do you keep the milk?â Nickyâs frustrated voice came back into hearing rangeâ¦  âIn the fridgeâ¦.idiotâ I said mimicking her while mumbling âidiotâ  I know that you pea brain! Thereâs only an empty carton of milk in thereâ¦where do you store the OTHER cartons of milk?â she asked me again waving her arms around like a mad womanâ¦  I stared at her confusingly and flabbergastedâ¦what was the weirdo going on about now?  She groaned in annoyance.  âGive me your car keysâ¦Iâm going shoppingâ she said demandinglyâ¦while motioning me to throw her the keys with her handâ¦  Now THAT I understoodâ¦no way was I lending her MY carâ¦she would probably run off with itâ¦could she even drive? Was she even educated enough?!  I started having a panic attackâ¦think FAST Benâ¦she doesnât like waitingâ¦youâll get another slap on the head if you donât come up with an answerâ¦I could hear a clock ticking in my headâ¦beads of sweat dripped from my foreheadâ¦  My forehead creased in lines of stress while my eyebrows arched into a frown, my eyes narrowed desperately searching for an answerâ¦  âIâm g-g-goingâ¦â I started  âSpit it out you retard!â she commanded at me  âIâmâ¦Iâmâ¦.GOING WITH YOU!!â I blurted out in one desperate attempt.  I gave out a sigh of reliefâ¦now I was free of the stress and pressureâ¦calmly I wiped away the bead of salty sweat that I had formed on my forehead from the ordealâ¦  My breathing slowly regulated as I took in deep breathsâ¦  âFine!â Nicky answered before walking towards her room to changeâ¦  *sigh*â¦this was going to be a LONG dayâ¦  âIâm going with youââ¦âIâM going with YOUââ¦ âNOâ¦Iâm GOING with YOUââ¦.I walked and talked to myself while thinking of how easily and swiftly I had managed to dodge another hit from Nickyâ¦*sigh*â¦I was just too goodâ¦and to thinkâ¦no, I Benjamin Uyâ¦certainly did NOT go into stress or panic at the timeâ¦*sigh*â¦I really was the most talented and calm guy in the worldâ¦     CHAPTER 17  [Benâs P.O.V.] *25th August*  [At the Markets]  I pushed my dark shaded glasses up, making sure that they werenât falling downâ¦it was pretty cold todayâ¦  Following Nicky I walked closely behind making sure that no one had recognized meâ¦.I didnât want to be seen with a pig like herâ¦seeing as how I was CLEARLY the Beauty in this whole crisisâ¦.not in a girly way of courseâ¦I was OBVIOUSLY manly and masculineâ¦I mean, just look at these bulging muscles!  I pulled my beanie over my headâ¦this was very, very embarrassing seeing as how Nicky had managed to yank A LOT of my hair out and now I had an extremely LARGE bold patch on the side of my head..*Sigh*â¦   tried dressing casuallyâ¦but everywhere I went people stared at meâ¦was it because I was dressing too cool for someone with a bold patch and a couple bruises on his face *Sigh*â¦I mustâve looked like a gangster on patrolâ¦.it would explain why I kept glancing around to see if any hot chicks were looking my wayâ¦  âHurry up Ben...Iâm hungry and I want to buy milk!â Nicky said turning around with her arms crossed impatientlyâ¦  âSHhhâ¦SHhH!!â I shrieked out desperately trying to get her to shut upâ¦  I didnât want her shouting my dead, sexy name out to everybody in the supermarketâ¦it would give me a bad name if I was taking orders from HERâ¦let alone, following HERâ¦I mean, donât get me wrong but I am what girls dream ofâ¦what they fantasize aboutâ¦I am their dream hunkâ¦yepâ¦thatâs me for you, Godâs gift to womenâ¦  Itâs not that sheâs not pretty or anythingâ¦she isâ¦believe me, but would it hurt if she acted a bit more feminine and if she made me look a bit more manly and in control..*sigh*â¦  âDonât you SHHh ME Ben! Get your BUTT here right now!â Nicky spat out, obviously annoyed and offended.  She stomped her foot on the ground and pointed at her feet forcing me to beckon at her call...  I lowered my head in embarrassment as passer-bys stood and stared at us oddlyâ¦  âHurry up will you!â I hissed at her when everybody had resumed doing whatever they were doingâ¦  âYou were the one that wanted to come along!â she accused me.  I kept quiet not wishing to cause a sceneâ¦hopefully no one from Crystal Bar was around..*sigh*â¦so embarrassing they would seeâ¦Meâ¦ âVoted sexiest man aliveâ with a simple Bar Girl...how demeaning of meâ¦  We went into the markets and she picked up a carton of milk as well as some groceries and meatsâ¦  âThatâll be $29.40 thanksâ the counter lady said flatly  I gazed around expecting Nicky to pay; when our eyes met she stared at me expectantlyâ¦  I stared back at her refusing to give inâ¦no way was I going to part with MY moneyâ¦she was crazy!  We got out of the storeâ¦Nicky had a bright smile on her face while I slouched and walked carelessly with a glum expression on my faceâ¦  You can obviously see who had to payâ¦*sigh*â¦  âIâm Hungryâ Nicky complained.  âGreat lets go home and eatâ I said excitedly in a hurryâ¦  âNoâ¦letâs not go home and eatâ¦letâs eat hereâ Nicky replied with a sneer on her face.  Damn! She must have read my mindâ¦*sigh*â¦no point arguing with the MAN of the houseâ¦seeing as how she seems to overpower me 99.9% of the timeâ¦urghâ¦  We reached the food court and she ordered Mac Donaldâs for us while I sat down, left with the groceries at a secluded table waiting for the food to comeâ¦  When she came back we both ate our burgers devouring the tasteâ¦mmmâ¦she was right, it was nice to eat Mc Donaldâs for a changeâ¦  While we were eating I discovered the most evil plan I had conjured so farâ¦this was going to be goodâ¦I smiled constantlyâ¦  âWhat the hellâs the matter with you?â Nicky asked me annoyed at my happy expressionâ¦  âNothingâ¦â I replied before looking in the other direction waiting for the perfect time to strikeâ¦  âIdiotâ she would mumbleâ¦  After we ate I offered to carry the groceriesâ¦she got up from her seat and I followed closely behind herâ¦  As I walked behind her I tried my best to look as sad and down as a lost puppyâ¦I walked slowly and lugged the groceries with meâ¦people stared at me and gave out sympathetic whines of pity towards meâ¦obviously assuming that I wasnât the most happiest person in the worldâ¦  Nicky took long, quick stepsâ¦occasionally she would glance back at me to make sure I was keeping up with herâ¦  When I was slow enoughâ¦she turned around and walked towards meâ¦  âOh stop being a wimp! Theyâre not THAT heavyâ she grumbled.  I retaliated and held onto the groceries as she reached out to carry them for meâ¦  âLet go!â she whispered with malice  I remained solemn and held onto the groceries with my dear lifeâ¦  When her force was strong enough I let go of the food and it tumbled onto the floor with a thudâ¦  Everyone stared our wayâ¦that was my queueâ¦  I collapsed to my knees and picked up the groceries one by one while giving out soft whimpers and sobs so the whole food court could hearâ¦okay so maybe it wasnât that soft...but as long as it workedâ¦  âWhatâs the matter? Iâve never seen a full grown man cry beforeâ a woman approached me full of concernâ¦  This girl was quite cute tooâ¦  âI canât sayâ¦â I gave out a little wailâ¦  âShhhâ¦itâs okayâ¦you can tell meâ¦â she comforted me while the rest of the audience had crowded around me   From the corner of my eye I could see Nickyâs flabbergasted look as she watched everybody walk towards me to see what the commotion wasâ¦  âOhâ¦itâs nothing, just the childrenâ¦they need meâ¦â I told her in-between sobsâ¦  âWhat children?â she asked me confused.  âThe homeless children, Iâve dedicated my life in raising them and sheltering themâ¦they need meâ I sobbed and whimpered creating more effectâ¦  âI donât have enough moneyâ¦today I was firedâ¦my boss told me that I wasnât putting enough effort into my workâ¦but I canât help it, the children need someone to care for themâ¦thereâs 5 of themâ¦theyâre so young and precious to meâ¦â I said trying hard to form tears in my eyesâ¦  âOh youâre such a saint!â the woman cried out in sympathyâ¦  Everyone else cooed at me and told me it was going to be okayâ¦  âToday I came to the markets minding my own business and spending my last $30 dollars on groceries to feed those precious little thingsâ¦andâ¦andâ¦â I broke down crying again acting more pitifulâ¦  âItâs okayâ¦you can tell usâ¦â the lady said putting a comforting hand on my shoulder as she knelt down beside me and the spilt groceries which were on the floor nowâ¦  I wailed and cried like a lost childâ¦by now I had gotten the attention of the employees behind the counter of every food stallâ¦  âThat...that cruel and heartless woman over there, she was trying to snatch my groceries awayâ¦I tried explaining to her that the children needed themâ¦and sh-she saidâ¦â I stuttered as I spoke while pointed an accusing finger at Nickyâ¦  Everyone turned her way and stared at her accusingly and disgusted at herâ¦she gave me the most evil glare you could ever imagineâ¦inside I was laughing my head offâ¦but outside I had to play it cool in order to get maximum satisfactionâ¦this was way too funâ¦  âShe saidâ¦thatâ¦homeless children wereâ¦.wereâ¦.USELESS AND UNLOVED AND THEY DESERVED TO DIE!!!!!!â I blurted out while tears trickled down my cheekâ¦  I bawled my eyes out while the lady gave me a comforting hugâ¦  I didnât have to look but I could tell that everyone was glaring at Nicky like she was the most disgusting and fowl thing that ever roamed the planetâ¦*sigh*â¦my plan was working perfectlyâ¦now all I had to do was finish it offâ¦  âWellâ¦*sniffle*â¦I donât want to bother youâ¦good, GOOD people but I must be going nowâ¦I canât keep the children waitingâ¦they need me, but I have NO IDEA how Iâm going to explain that they will have no dinner tonightâ¦or supperâ¦or breakfast the next dayâ¦â I said giving a sympathetic look to all the by-standersâ¦  They gave me sympathetic, pitiful looks with little whines of sorrowâ¦  One by one I slowly picked up the soiled vegetables from the ground while placing them in the paper bag glumlyâ¦  âWait! I think Iâve got some money I can help you with!â the lady said trying to help.  âNoâ¦I canât take thatâ¦it wouldnât be right.â I refused.  âYes it would...I want to help the children too!â the woman reassured meâ¦  âwellâ¦if itâs for the childrenâ¦.thank youâ¦your help is kindly appreciatedâ¦wait till they hear the newsâ¦such an angel has come down to help them..â I said with gratitude and relief in my voiceâ¦  I took her money and held it in my hand as if it was goldâ¦soon after all the other people came up to me and said a few kind words as well as handing me money to by groceries for the âhomelessâ childrenâ¦*sigh*â¦  As they walked past meâ¦they shot Nicky evil glares and gave her rude commentsâ¦  âShame on you!â one would say.  âYouâre the one who doesnât deserve to live!â someone would spit at her..  âYou need help!â another would retort  Nicky opened her mouth to speak as her eyes bulged in fury and wondermentâ¦in the end she sighed and crossed her arms in defeatâ¦  NOW who got the last laughâ¦I secretly smirked to myself knowing I had the upper hand nowâ¦not to mention piles of money in my pocketâ¦  When we finally got home Nicky couldnât stop shooting me evil glaresâ¦.  âWhat? Donât you care about the homeless children?â I asked her innocently while taunting and teasing herâ¦  âCheap bastardâ she mumbledâ¦  âSay that to my face young lady!â I dared her.  âCheap threat!â she yelled out before stomping off in one of her fits againâ¦  Today was actually quite funâ¦although I paid P1,537â¦it was sure worth itâ¦I managed to earn P9,895 as well as humiliating Nicky in front of a whole crowdâ¦*sigh*â¦I was just too goodâ¦  *****************TO BE CONTINUED****************

      Chapter 11  [Benâs P.O.V.] When we finally got to my apartment, I made sure she saw me give her a big glare before getting out of the carâ¦  I still have no idea why she wanted 100 days forâ¦and she didnât seem like a BULC member so I havenât a clue why sheâd want to stay with meâ¦  Maybe she was an âundercoverâ BULC member, and she was supposed to report back to my fellow fans, to see how I acted in these types of situationsâ¦  I nodded my head agreeing with my theoryâ¦Benjamin Uyâ¦.you really are something arenât youâ¦  I smiled to myself leading the way to my apartment knowing I had figured out, yet another problemâ¦  When we got to the front of my apartment I punched in the code and slid in easily while she followed closely behind like a second shadowâ¦I had to admit, being the sexiest man alive makes you become anxious and paranoid at timesâ¦But I guess thatâs the down side of being âGodâs gift to womenââ¦  Switching the light on, I slumped on the couch and exhaled and inhaled slowly taking deep breathsâ¦finally, some relaxationâ¦ahhhhâ¦  âHey!!! Shit-Benâ¦where do I sleep?!â  I stirred in my peaceful serenity when an arrogant feminine/Manly voice said in menaceâ¦  âHeLoOOo? Anyone there?!â  There it was againâ¦please tell me Iâm dreamingâ¦I squinted my eyes shut hoping that I was just having a nightmareâ¦.  â¦Quietâ¦.  I breathed in a sigh of relief and busied myself trying to get comfortable on the couch with my eyes still securely shutâ¦I tossed and turned while hugging a soft cushionâ¦  Sleepily I lay in a comfortable position and slowly began to drift offâ¦  Something was tugging at my hairâ¦I brushed my hair with an easy swift of my handâ¦.after twitching my nose I prepared myself to drift offâ¦  Again, there was this annoying tugging sensation on my hairâ¦figuring I was just being paranoid I didnât move and instead of swatting at my hair again I waited for the tugging sensation to go awayâ¦. âAAhhHHhHHhhHH!!!!!â  My eyes widened in shock and pain as I gently stroked my precious hair, I grumbled in annoyance and turned around to face my attackerâ¦it was probably Jake being a jealous idiot because my hair was more silkier and softer then his so he had decided to yank out a whole clump of my hairâ¦daMn idiot...  I turned around and my eyes grew widerâ¦that lesbian girlâ¦Sheeshâ¦she just canât get enough of me huh? I figured that she had yanked my hair out to put in her personal stash of her âBULC member possessionsâ¦â  My eyes narrowed into dime slots as I gave her my best evilsâ¦with my lips pressed together showing I was extremely annoyed I tried to intimidate her and make her feel uneasyâ¦  She stood there with her arms crossed not the least bit moved by my attemptâ¦Obviously my plan back firedâ¦if I was trying to make someone feel small and nervousâ¦That person would be meâ¦*sigh*  âStop looking constipated and tell me where Iâm supposed to sleepâ she retorted.  âWhat?!...ME? Constipated?!â I yelled back in astonishment  âYeah YOU!!!â She said emphasizing the word âyouâ  I had to admitâ¦for pretty girls like her, she sure knew how to make me feel inferior, and I thought that GUYS were meant to make girls feel that wayâ¦  I gave out an exaggerated groan making sure I did it right in her face to show how annoying she wasâ¦  âSleep anywhereâ¦â I replied.  âIf you wanted to know you couldâve just asked you know no need to pull my hairâ I started again sounding aggravated.  Her face turned cherry redâ¦huh? Did I say something wrong? I stood there dumbfounded wondering what had gotten her in such a crap moodâ¦  âI DID ASK!!! YOU IDIOT!!! YOU WERE TOO BUSY IN LA-LA LAND!!!â she blew her top off  Wowâ¦this girl sure had temper problemsâ¦maybe I should steer clear of her for a couple of daysâ¦or maybe the next 100 daysâ¦.  She stamped her foot like a little girlâ¦in other circumstances Iâd say she looked cute when she was angryâ¦but right now, since I wasnât in the âbestâ mood I could be in, she had a shocking resemblance to a stubborn cowâ¦.hmmmâ¦.  I stood there staring at her while she chucked a tantrumâ¦this was amusing, If I had been more tired then I already wasâ¦I wouldâve been certain she had given out a loud, longâ¦ âMoOOOoOoOâ  *Whack!!!*  While I was thinking, the lesbian Girl had somehow gotten close enough to me to whack me at the back of my headâ¦urGhâ¦she sure was violent.  âWhat the Heck was that for?!â I said annoyingly at her while touching the back of my head.  She smirked that same, annoying smirk she always hadâ¦Man, she was really pissing me offâ¦if she wasnât a girl I wouldâve wiped that smirk off her face by throwing a big, fat punch on her faceâ¦Oooâ¦that would be funâ¦.  âYou were staring at me you idiotâ¦donât you know itâs rude to stare?!â she retorted rudelyâ¦  I stood there flabbergasted and dumbfoundedâ¦had I been staring? I didnât realizeâ¦whoops...heheheâ¦  âJust staring at a stubborn Cowâ I said while facing the other way and feeling cool about my come back  *Thwack!*   âAwwâ¦shit!!â I yelled in pain when she hit me for the second time on the back of my headâ¦  I spun around to face her with my deadly glare [Dime slot eyes and pressed lips]â¦She didnât seem to be moved at allâ¦*sigh*â¦again, I had failed my attempt to make her feel inferiorâ¦Damn Womanâ¦  I ignored her this time and walked briskly to the bathroom intending to inspect the damage she had done to my hairâ¦  I checked all parts of my hair and found a big chunk of hair missing from one side!!!...I leaned in to inspect the damage caused by the tyrantâ¦  Oh shitâ¦there was a clear and visible bold patchâ¦greatâ¦not only was my face badly damaged by her Man-fist punches but now she had given me a frigging bold patch!!!  This was by farâ¦the most miserable day Iâve ever hadâ¦how was I going to face my lovely fans?! Theyâd probably ditch me for someone who isnât even half the man I amâ¦they could even begin to worship âFat Catââ¦and thatâs not even a bloody man!!!  Or maybe theyâll like pimps betterâ¦  *Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  Fat Man sitting on the couch watching TV surrounded by empty packets of chips and beer bottlesâ¦  His laughter sounds the room while heâs surrounded by my former fansâ¦that are showing him affectionâ¦they used to do that to me tooâ¦  Iâm sitting in the corner of the room while all the hot girls surround that-that-thatâ¦.DOLL BLUDGER!!!   I crouch in the corner hugging my legs while rocking back and forth with endless tears streaming down my faceâ¦.  âGirlsâ¦w-what *sniffle* a-aboutâ¦your s-s-sexy man *sniffle* Benjamin Uy?â I say in-between snufflesâ¦had they completely forgotten about me?  âWhat about *sniffle* BULC what happened? *sniffle*â I asked them while hugging myself tightlyâ¦my clothes were soaked with tears nowâ¦  One of the girls tilts her head towards me while she caressed the fat manâs chestâ¦.  âBULC? That was in the pastâ¦I donât even know why I was a member of that stupid clubâ¦itâs BBLC nowâ¦â she said in disgust while she talked about BULCâ¦  How could she? It pained my heartâ¦she was once one of the girls who loved me the mostâ¦  âBBLC?â I asked her dumbfounded at her retortâ¦  âBULL BLUDGER LOVERS CLUB!!!â all the other girls screamed excitedly in unison while they pampered that disgusting animal like he was Godâ¦it was a disgusting sightâ¦  From the corner of my eye I saw Fat Cat walk by with more fans surrounding âitâ  âNoOOoOoOoOooOooo!!!â I yelled in agony not wishing to believe I was unlovedâ¦  *End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  âNo!!â I shrieked.  Huh? What? Oh, it wasnât realâ¦Thank Godâ¦  I thought about what I had dreamt ofâ¦BULC? I think this is a sign from God that I have to do something unless I want that dream to become a realityâ¦*sigh*    CHAPTER 12  [Nickyâs P.O.V.] After Ben walked to the bathroom ignoring my hit to his head I smirked to myself yet again, that idiot was such a sissyâ¦  I looked at my surroundings and went exploring in his apartmentâ¦kitchen, bathroom, toilet, 2 bedrooms, and a family roomâ¦hMmsâ¦not bad I guess  One bedroom was Benâsâ¦I could tell because there were posters of cars and girls all over the placeâ¦the arrogant pig-headâ¦*sigh*â¦  In the other bedroom it had a mattress and that was about itâ¦I decided that this would be my new roomâ¦perfectâ¦  Busily I went to the family room and grabbed my few belongings and settled in to my new bedroom making myself at homeâ¦  Just as I was about to go to sleep Ben barged into my new room like an idiotâ¦  âBy the wayâ¦whatâs your name?â he asked me flabbergastedâ¦  He looked like he had just run a marathonâ¦  I stood there dumbfounded for a while before replyingâ¦  âNIckyâ¦Just call me Nickyâ I said not letting my guard down just incase he was planning to get revenge on meâ¦  âNicky hey? Hmmsâ¦thatâs a nice nameâ¦but I prefer stubborn cow or lesbian girlâ he said before jolting out of my room like a flashâ¦  I sat on the mattress confused at what he had saidâ¦when I had taken it all in and realized he was insulting me I ran out of my room and it was my turn to barge into hisâ¦  I turned the door knob furiously before realizing he had locked the door alreadyâ¦why that conniving buggerâ¦  âOpen the door Benjamin Uy!!!â I yelled while pounding furiously on the door making a big racketâ¦  âStubborn Cow! Stubborn Cow! Stubborn Cow!â he taunted and teased on the other sideâ¦  ArgHâ¦that arrogant bratâ¦Damn Him!!!  âOPEN THE FRIGGING DOOR RIGHT NOW IF YOU DONâT WANT A FISTFUL IN YOUR LOUD MOUTH!!!â I yelled at the top of my lungs while turning as red as a tomatoâ¦  âIâm not completely stupid you know!!!â he yelled back, obviously refusing to budge from his positionâ¦  âIâll kick this door down if I have toâ¦then youâll be sorryâ¦â I said in a deadly whisper loud enough so he could hear me seething with wrathâ¦  There was silence on the other sideâ¦he was probably thinking of an escape routeâ¦hahahaâ¦he was in deep shit nowâ¦by the time Iâm going to be finished with himâ¦heâll have a hell of a lot things to complain aboutâ¦possibly a medical billâ¦  âOpen the door now or I swear Iâm going to kick this door down and youâll be in for it!!!â I yelled again deciding to give him a second chanceâ¦  ââ¦1â¦â I said beginning my count downâ¦  ââ¦2â¦â the tension was beginning to increase along with the suspenseâ¦I backed away from the door intending to get a run upâ¦  ââ¦3!!!â I yelled before charged at the door and closing my eyesâ¦  Just as I was about to hit the wood of the door Ben unlocked the door and I ran straight into him causing him to fall down with a thumpâ¦  I heard him curse to himself about the pain he was inâ¦I leaned in closely to see his hurt expression his forehead was creased and his eyebrows formed a frownâ¦  For the first timeâ¦I began to realize that Ben really wasnât a bad guyâ¦he just acted like an arrogant pig now and thenâ¦but other then that, he was alrightâ¦his face showed sincerity and honestyâ¦and he sure knew how to hold his temper! Although he thought he was all that it did make him look like a foolâ¦even if he was quite cuteâ¦  Who knowsâ¦maybe he could be my entertainment for the next 100 days to comeâ¦I stared intently into his eyes while he looked into mineâ¦It seemed as if he was searching for somethingâ¦like he was trying to understand meâ¦to find a weakness in meâ¦  After a few moments we began to realize the awkward situation and both of us quickly turned away as I realized I was laying on top of himâ¦I got up quickly and smoothed out my PJâsâ¦  He sat up from the floor and I got a good look at himâ¦his PJâs were very peculiar for a guyâ¦Blue Care Bear teddy top and Starry Pants with Moon shapes as wellâ¦  I sighed loudly while tsking himâ¦and giggling light heartedlyâ¦  âWhatâs so funny?â he asked me confusingly  âNothingâ¦Iâm going to sleep now...I think Iâve already gotten enough pay back for todayâ¦just looking at your girlish PJâs will already make you embarrassedâ I said before walking back to my room trying to suppress my laughterâ¦  I could picture Ben right now staring down at his PJâs and looking in the direction I had walked inâ¦then staring back down at his PJâs before actually getting the messageâ¦and turning bright redâ¦  I giggled to myselfâ¦*sigh*...Ben really was the most slowest pig everâ¦  I settled down on the mattress and pulled the covers over my body...I began to think how annoying and irritating Ben could beâ¦him and his arrogant waysâ¦it was quite amusing seeing him angryâ¦  I began to drift off to sleepâ¦     CHAPTER 13  [Benâs P.O.V.] I woke up at 11:00amâ¦earlier then Nicky of courseâ¦  Today is the 23rd of August...I decided that a Contract should be drawn up if both of us were to keep our wordâ¦obviously I would, Iâm not that dirty and I donât resort to trickeryâ¦but I canât say so much about herâ¦  I got out a piece of paper while I busily wrote down a contract agreementâ¦My tongue always seems to stick out when Iâm concentrating hardâ¦and it was sticking out againâ¦I never seemed to notice it beforeâ¦but now I doâ¦  When I was done it read-  Evidence of Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd Augustâ¦During the 100 daysâ¦she is not to physically abuse or insult Benjamin Uy, as he is Godâs gift to women and should be treated with respectâ¦  After 100 days when it lies on the 1st of December, Nicky is required to return the belongs that she had dirtily stole ferociously from innocent Benjamin Uyâ¦who is the victim in this whole dealing.  On the bottom of this sheet, please sign your name as prove of agreementâ¦going back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky only as she is not Benjamin Uy who is a literal chick magnetâ¦  Signature here Signature here Nicky- Benjamin Uy-  ----- I stepped back to admire my workâ¦It looked a bit plain to me so I decided to decorate it a bitâ¦on the side a drew a devil with hornsâ¦and an angel with a haloâ¦I think these two pictures represent Nicky and I perfectlyâ¦  I trudged to her room feeling pleased with myself that I had thought of the whole contract thing and made it as fair as it could possibly beâ¦I no longer thought that she was a BULC member...so I didnât have to worry that she would tell everyone else that I was meanâ¦  I knocked on her door and no one answeredâ¦it was 11:30am nowâ¦  I quietly twisted the door knob and opened the door silentlyâ¦it made a slight creaking sound that made me winceâ¦beads of sweat dripped down my face hopping that she wasnât going to ambush me with an uncalled for attackâ¦  Who ever said that girls were submissive mustâve had severe brain damageâ¦I erased all thought of that stupid, false statement and decided to rely on my senses insteadâ¦that is if I want to survive the tyrants ferocious attacks on meâ¦  To my relief I let out a contempt sigh as I saw her on the floor snoozing away like a pigâ¦I crept up towards her face and poked her a little in the cheek trying to wake her upâ¦she twitched her nose in reply and tossed her body to the other sideâ¦that didnât seem to workâ¦  This time I prodded her near her shoulder trying to get her to stir and wake upâ¦nothing happened againâ¦I whispered in her ear trying to tell her to wake up but to no avail she didnât budgeâ¦  She sure was a heavy sleeperâ¦after coming up with the conclusion that I wasnât trying hard enough I decided to be more aggressiveâ¦besides I wanted payback for yanking a big clump of my hair outâ¦  I reached out and her hair was in my grasp but then I thought to myselfâ¦what if she counter attacked and this was just a plan of hers and when I least expected it she would jump out at meâ¦I withdrew my hand as more beads of sweat ran down my foreheadâ¦  Forming a frown on my forehead I had no idea what to doâ¦this was the perfect chance to pounce on her and catch her off guard but I didnât know what evil thing I could do to herâ¦urghâ¦Benjamin Uy you really are thick sometimesâ¦  I decided to see if she was faking it or notâ¦  âNickyâ¦wake up!!!â I said quite loudlyâ¦  She gave out a groan and mumbled a little before settling back down and pulling the sheets over her shouldersâ¦  I let out a sigh of relief knowing I still had the perfect chance to get my revengeâ¦  At that time I couldnât think of anything really evil to do to her besides pull her hairâ¦as I grabbed her hair in my hand gently I stopped againâ¦and I thought of an evil planâ¦I smirked to myself and silently crept out of her room and into mineâ¦  I got my stereo system and placed them all besides her ears completely surrounded herâ¦then I cranked up the volume and put on a loud Rock Music CD inâ¦  When the speakers were placed in position I crept back out of her room with the remote control in my handâ¦then I got a mop and held onto the opposite end while edging towards her faceâ¦I smothered her with the mop and I hear her muffled soundsâ¦it seemed as if she was cursingâ¦as soon as I sensed that she was going to wake up I quickly with drew the mop from her room and closed the door while pressing the âPLAYâ button on the remoteâ¦  All of a sudden I heard her scream as the extremely loud rock music boomed throughout the whole buildingâ¦*sigh*â¦Music to my earsâ¦this was my pay back for sureâ¦and this wasnât the end of itâ¦  I heard heavy footsteps nearing her doorâ¦I held on to the door knob tightly not allowing her to escape the loud musicâ¦  âBEN!!! IâM GOING TO KICK YOUR SORRY ASS FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!â she screamed her lungs outâ¦  I smirked to myself knowing I had got her this timeâ¦  After a few moments of cursing and threats directed my way I decided to end her torture and I turned the speakers offâ¦she was probably deaf by nowâ¦I sneered when I finally let her outâ¦  I turned around and walked to my room intending to get down to business and get her to sigh the contract leaving her free from her loud prisonâ¦  *Thump*  I heard the shrill scream of Nickyâ¦I ran towards the direction and saw her lying flat on the ground clutching her elbowâ¦  When I finally realized that the mop was wet and she had slipped on the puddle of water the mop had left behind I felt guiltyâ¦I didnât mean to go that farâ¦  For the next 5 minutes she kept complaining that her arm hurt so I took her to the doctorâ¦he said that she had a fractured arm so he placed a cast around itâ¦  When we got back she gave me a cold glare and continued to make me feel more worse then I already didâ¦she threw curses and insults my wayâ¦most of which she called me an arrogant pigâ¦.  I constantly said sorry to her and repeated myself saying that I didnât intentionally want to make her fallâ¦  It was amazing how many curses she could say in one breathâ¦I counted a total of 27â¦I never got bored of hearing her insult meâ¦Donât get me wrongâ¦I found it really offensive but she sure knew a lot of swear wordsâ¦not to mention threats that she directed towards me menacinglyâ¦     CHAPTER 14  [Benâs P.O.V.] After she was out of breath I decided to bring up the contractâ¦I sauntered to my room and got the agreement sheet I had drew up earlierâ¦.I was proud of my effortsâ¦  I handed it to her without saying a wordâ¦  âWhatâs this?â she asked me confused.  âRead itâ I replied casuallyâ¦  I heard her busily reading the page while her eyes moved back and forth she mumbled the wordsâ¦  With each second that passed her expression grew more angry and her forehead began to show creases with her eyebrows arched in a frownâ¦  âWhat the hell is this?â she started again, obviously being unfair about the whole situationâ¦  âRead itâ I retorted  âIâve already read itâ¦this is a load of crapâ¦in an agreement you canât be bias you have to be fair!â she yelled back feeling frustration and a right to have justice boil inside of herâ¦  âWhat are you talking about? Iâve read through it, and it seems completely fair to meâ¦thereâs nothing wrong with itâ I retorted back defending myselfâ¦  She scoffed at me rather rudelyâ¦  âNothing wrong with it? Let me read it again for youâ¦â came her reply as she pulled the agreement towards her faceâ¦  âEvidence of Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd Augustâ¦During the 100 daysâ¦she is not to physically abuse or insult Benjamin Uy, as HE IS GODâS GIFT TO WOMEN AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECTâ¦  After 100 days when it lies on the 1st of December, Nicky is required to return the belongs that she had DIRTILY STOLE FEROCIOUSLY from INNOCENT Benjamin Uyâ¦WHO IS THE VICTIM in this whole dealing.  On the bottom of this sheet, please sign your name as prove of agreementâ¦going back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky ONLY as she is not Benjamin Uy who is a literal chick magnetâ¦â she made sure she emphasized particular bits of the agreementâ¦[I have no idea why though]   She stared at me after, waiting for some sort of reactionâ¦  I remained calm and solemn still not understanding why she felt the need to justify my actionsâ¦what was her problemâ¦this contract is 100% fair in every wayâ¦  âSo? Whatâs wrong with itâ came my dumbfounded respond.  Again, she scoffed at meâ¦obviously there was something I was missing or something that she didnât seeâ¦maybe she hadnât written up a contract agreement beforeâ¦I nodded my head understandinglyâ¦that would explain why she thought my contract was unfairâ¦  âHmmâ¦I donât knowâ¦all of it!â she retorted sarcasticallyâ¦  I looked at her blankly not knowing what to sayâ¦I donât get itâ¦whatâs wrong with itâ¦  âWhat do you mean by âall of itâ I asked her trying to get her to elaborateâ¦  She sighed loudly making me feel dumbâ¦  âYour discriminating meâ¦which your NOT allowed to do in a fair agreementâ¦youâre being unfair by saying âgoing back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky ONLYââ¦what kind of a fair agreement is thisâ¦and you make yourself look like the good guy while I look evil and heartless!!!â she retorted at me trying to make a pointâ¦  âDonât be absurdâ¦how can I make myself look like the good guy and make you look heartless?!...I didnât write that down!â I snapped at her trying to get her to see the factsâ¦  Again she scoffed at meâ¦damnâ¦her scoffing problem was beginning to get annoyingâ¦I shouldâve asked the doctor if she had any mental problemsâ¦  âOh Yeah?!...how do you explain the constant praising of yourself and the constant put downs that you add into the agreement to make me look bad and make you look good?â she asked me in a know-it-all wayâ¦  âI did not! I never wrote downâ¦ âNicky is a stubborn cowâ or âNicky is evilâ!!!â I retorted back defensivelyâ¦  She groaned at me hinting that I wasnât getting the messageâ¦but I got it perfectly wellâ¦she just didnât know how to draw up an agreementâ¦thatâs allâ¦  I was going to stick with my storyâ¦she was just jealous of my excellent skillsâ¦and I find it very offensive that she thinks that my agreement is worthlessâ¦honestly, she could show a little more respect towards my fine workâ¦  âHow do you explain the picture of a cow with devil horns and a red hot poker on the side where Iâm meant to sign and on the other side where youâre meant to sign it has a picture of what looks like a male model with a halo on top of his head?!â she screeched at meâ¦  âOhâ¦you like my artwork?!â I asked her excitedly forgetting about the whole point of this argumentâ¦  At least she could tell what the pictures wereâ¦I felt proud of myself again, not only was I blessed with shockingly good looks and charm, I was also talented with artworkâ¦wowâ¦you really are something, Benâ¦  She groaned even louder this timeâ¦she was beginning to get fed up with meâ¦  âYOU ARE SUCH A SLOW PIG!!!â she shrieked at meâ¦  âHuh?â I blurted out confused about the whole situationâ¦  She sighed loudly and got out a piece of paper and penâ¦  âSit down Benâ she ordered meâ¦  I did as I was told and I sat down obediently beside her as she wrote down the titleâ¦  âFAIR contract agreementâ  She really was a stubborn cow sometimesâ¦sheeshâ¦I bet she just couldnât stand the fact that my work was shockingly impressive towards her standardsâ¦and her, being the stubborn cow she is couldnât stand the fact that I had thought of something before herâ¦so she had to be the boss and draw up her own contractâ¦  Just because she was new at this sort of thing didnât mean she had to discriminate my good workâ¦I sighed to myself disappointed that we werenât going to use my contractâ¦  Nicky raised an eyebrow at me but I chose to ignore it and brush it offâ¦I stared into space while I waited for her to finish the contractâ¦  âDone!â she exclaimed happily I snapped out of my thoughts to face herâ¦then I looked at the agreementâ¦  It read-  FAIR Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd Augustâ¦after the finish date of 100 days [1st December] Nicky will be required to return the belongings of Benjamin Uy that she currently possesses.  During the 100 days Benjamin Uy is expected to treat Nicky as an equal and she, the same.

Signature Here Signature Here Benjamin Uy- Nicky-  ---  I finished reading the agreement, I had to admitâ¦It was relatively goodâ¦of course not as good as mine thoughâ¦and there werenât even any decorations either!  Who did she think she was, some rich girl with such a good educationâ¦sheeshâ¦she didnât have to use such big wordsâ¦I meanâ¦weâre no rocket scientistsâ¦I mumbled my feelings outâ¦luckily she didnât hear thoughâ¦she just shot me another weird lookâ¦  Personally I think that my contract was by far better than hersâ¦I donât know what she was thinking about when she wrote her contract upâ¦no ideaâ¦  Whatever she saysâ¦Iâm still going to keep the original contract that I drew up because I really admire my workâ¦heheheâ¦maybe I should even frame itâ¦hmmsâ¦  I reluctantly signed the agreement and she did tooâ¦.after the signing I decided to frame the agreement that she had drew up since we were using that one nowâ¦and not mineâ¦*sigh*â¦  My original agreement with my wonderful artwork, I kept it in my room and stuck it on my wallâ¦heheheâ¦     CHAPTER 15  [Nickyâs P.O.V.] *24th August*  I woke up at 8:00am and this time by my own free willâ¦  Lazily I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, Ben was already awake and he was in the process of squeezing tooth paste on his crystal, blue, brushâ¦  âMorningâ he said not bothering to look up.  âMorningâ came my greeting as I scratched my head sleepily.  I took my green brush and he handed me the toothpaste tubeâ¦he started brushing his teeth and I soon followed afterâ¦  Lazily, my eyes gazed around the bathroomâ¦Ben noticed me staring at a vase of flowers that were placed on top of the sinkâ¦  âTheyâre daffodilsâ he tried to say while his mouth was full of foam and toothpasteâ¦  I looked at him dumbfoundedâ¦then I looked at the flowers againâ¦yellowâ¦they look nice; I wonder if they smell niceâ¦  As if Ben could read my mind he spoke up again.  âDaffodilâs smell nice; go aheadâ¦take a whiffâ he told me inbetween brushing.  I looked at him hesitantly making sure he wasnât going to try anything funnyâ¦.he gave me an innocent look in return so I leaned in closer and clenched my toothbrush in my mouthâ¦  When I was about to take in a deep breath of flowers, the tap suddenly turned on and Ben splashed water all over my faceâ¦I jolted my head upwards andâ¦  *Bump!*  âAWwâ¦shit!â I cried out surprisedâ¦  I had forgotten that the bathroom mirror was also a door for a little storage place...and it just so happened that I was directly beneath itâ¦  âARgh! Benjamin come back here!â I yelled at himâ¦while I washed my face and spat out the foam from my mouthâ¦  I could hear his quick footsteps already out of the bathroomâ¦damn him!  âYouâre going to get it Ben!â I shrieked at himâ¦  When I had finished wiping my faceâ¦I went in search of Benâ¦  âBen?!â I called outâ¦  All of a sudden the bathroom door slammed shutâ¦what the? Aww crapâ¦damn that conniving pigâ¦he was probably hiding next to the door all this timeâ¦  âYouâll have to come out sometime Ben!!!â I hollered at himâ¦  Deciding to wait at the door till he came outâ¦I sat in front of the doorâ¦after a few minutes, I began to get hungry so I gave upâ¦  I figured heâd be hungry too so I made us both some pancakes and syrupâ¦  âMmMâ¦can you smell it Benâ¦smells sOoO good!!!...itâs pancakes and syrupâ¦yum yum!â I taunted and teased on the other side of the doorâ¦  There was no soundâ¦I wondered if he had already gone outâ¦I placed the plate of pancakes and syrup on the table and I checked his roomâ¦emptyâ¦  Thatâs strange, I wonder what heâs doingâ¦hmmâ¦ah wellsâ¦he can starve for all I careâ¦  I hurried to the table where I had left the plate eagerly wanting to take a bite from my yummy pancakes, to my shock it was goneâ¦what the?...I spun around, just in time to see Ben, still in his Care Bear PJâs rush to his room with MY plate of pancakes!...  âHEY!!!...BENJAMIN, YOU IGNORANT PIG!!!! THOSE ARE MY PANCAKES!!!â I screamed at the top of my lungsâ¦  He slammed the door shut and locked itâ¦*sigh*â¦  The mind of that guyâ¦sheeshâ¦I shook my head in disbelieveâ¦that cheeky little brat!  âYOUâLL HAVE TO COME OUT SOMETIME!!!...YOU KNOW, NO ONE CAN STOP YOU FROM GOING TO THE TOILET!!!...OR HAVING A SHOWER AND YOUâRE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT AGAIN ANYWAY!!!â I yelled out loud enough for him to hearâ¦  This time there was a replyâ¦  âI already went to the toilet, if I donât drink then I donât need to go to the toiletâ¦and ummâ¦I donât want to waste money so Iâm not taking a shower todayâ¦and ummâ¦Iâm on a diet!!!â he yelled back through the doorâ¦  What the? On a diet?  âThatâs the most lamest thing Iâve heard from you Ben!â I retorted.  This time there was no replyâ¦I decided to settle down and watch some TV until Ben came out of his roomâ¦what a sissy girlâ¦and he nicknames ME the stubborn cowâ¦sheesh!  For the whole day Ben didnât come out of his roomâ¦I was actually quite surprised because he had only eaten breakfast and that was about itâ¦  When it was dinner time he finally came out while I was cookingâ¦  âOoâ¦what smells so nice?!â he asked me while taking a deep breath and inhaling the aroma of assorted fish, poultry and vegetablesâ¦  I smirked to myselfâ¦  âOhâ¦nothing muchâ¦just cooking dinnerâ I replied casually like it was no big dealâ¦  âYou can cook?!â He blurted out in surprise and astonishment  His eyes were as big as golf balls and his mouth was hanging openâ¦I couldnât help but giggle at his funny expressionâ¦  âYeahâ¦I can cook!â I replied in an accusing way trying to sound as if I took offensive to his questionâ¦I didnât want to make him think I was going softâ¦that way my next move wouldnât seem so suspiciousâ¦  âSit down Benâ¦the rice is almost readyâ¦â I told him while going back to my cookingâ¦  He sat down obediently and waited quietly for me to finish cookingâ¦  When I had finished I spooned rice into two bowls and placed all the dishes on the tableâ¦then we began eatingâ¦  I ate something from every plate except for the beansâ¦  Mm...This tastes greatâ¦Oo...thatâs good! Mmm...Delicious!â he praised meâ¦  âYou think?â I would say while laughing light heartedly at himâ¦  I had to admit, the way he ate was quite cuteâ¦and boy could he eat! His mouth kept on chewing and his hand went back and forth grabbing fish, chicken and vegetables from each dishâ¦  When his chopsticks reached for the beansâ¦I couldnât help but form a sneer on my faceâ¦my mouth began to curve and form a grin as he took a large serving of beans and drew them close to his mouthâ¦  As the beans entered his mouth in one quick motion my eyes glistened awaiting the expected reactionâ¦  To my surprise he just kept eatingâ¦and chewingâ¦and gulpingâ¦my expression soon changed to dumbfoundedâ¦I scratched my head in confusion wondering why the 3 packets of âSuper Chili Powder-Twice as much powerâ hadnât workedâ¦  âAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â Ben jolted up from his chair and ran to the tap like a mad manâ¦  AHhhâ¦it had workedâ¦I must remember that Ben isnât like any other guyâ¦heâs a little slowerâ¦*sigh*â¦  I sat back in my chair and relaxedâ¦*sigh*  âMusic to my earsâ¦â I said to myself dreamily as I heard Benâs shrill voice screaming his head off as if screaming would stop the burning sensation on his tongueâ¦  I had to admitâ¦it took a little longer than I had expected for Ben to cool downâ¦the tap was running non-stop and his head was tilted on a side while trying to stop the burning feeling that he was experiencing he even stamped on his feet and waved his arms in the air like a hysterical weirdoâ¦or someone who was undertaking a sever seizure right nowâ¦this was way too amusingâ¦I should do this more often...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~WAIT FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      CHAPTER 1  [Benâs P.O.V.] I whistled to myself feeling sexier then ever while I winked at the passing girlsâ¦they seemed to show some interest in me tooâ¦secretly I smirked to myself knowing I, Benjamin Uy was literally a chick magnetâ¦  As I whistled and threw my car keys in the air I accidentally bumped in to someoneâ¦  âOh sorry sirâ a muffled, feminine voice saidâ¦  I was stunned for a few seconds before I peered down at the girlâ¦she seemed about my age but her hair covered her face from my viewâ¦I could just make out two large hazel eyesâ¦she seems pretty hotâ¦but briskly walked away after apologizing to meâ¦  âRight back at ya sexy!â I hollered at her as she walked past meâ¦  She didnât seem to notice my extremely handsome features or my sparkling smileâ¦I began to worryâ¦was I growing oldâ¦but Iâm only 23â¦ surely I canât have a wrinkle now can I?  I rushed to the nearest shop to find a mirrorâ¦Mc Donaldâs was the closest and I barged in and knocked a few plates out of customers who were walking to a tableâ¦I didnât careâ¦.they were the least of my problemsâ¦my looks were everythingâ¦everything!  As I neared the guysâ toilets I kicked the swinging door open not bothering to check if anybody was behind itâ¦Frantically I rushed to the nearest mirror to inspect my faceâ¦to my relief nothing was wrongâ¦the same sexy face peered right back at meâ¦  It felt great to see a handsome guy stare back at meâ¦I sighed to myself feeling better than everâ¦I decided to brand that girl a lesbian since she didnât seem the slightest bit moved by my good looksâ¦  Slowly I strolled over acting cool to the door of the guysâ toiletsâ¦I must have tripped on some water and I fell flat on my faceâ¦my world felt like it had crashed right down, how embarrassingâ¦silently I cursed about that girl who had knocked into meâ¦as my eyes adjusted and I attempted to get up a foot slammed right onto my backâ¦I winced in painâ¦What the hell was going onâ¦who ever did that was going to payâ¦my shirt was ruinedâ¦and even worse he could of made me permanently retarded with an imprint on my perfect body!!! Who would want me nowâ¦  âWho the hell are you?!â I demanded in pain as I lay on the tiles smelling the disgusting odor of urineâ¦  I turned my head a few inches to the side to see who to blameâ¦a tall figure peered over meâ¦his face was red and he seemed like he had just had a swim in the toilet bowlâ¦  âThe guy behind the door when you kicked it openâ he said with an evil smirk on his faceâ¦  Uh-oHâ¦Iâm in trouble nowâ¦I thought to myselfâ¦again I cursed at that bloody girl who hadnât noticed meâ¦if it wasnât for her than I wouldnât be in this mess right nowâ¦with an extremely bulky guy hovering over me with heaps of tattoos everywhere you could imagineâ¦  I had to admitâ¦it didnât seem like I could take this humongous mass of muscle onâ¦I meanâ¦I was pretty strong myself but this guy was so massive he could flatten meâ¦the odds were great and it didnât look pretty in the endâ¦  If you can imagine meâ¦a beautiful faced guy walking into the gents toilets in a hurryâ¦and then me, walking out like I had just being bashed to a pulp and had my head flushed down the toiletâ¦it wasnât prettyâ¦believe meâ¦  As I walked outâ¦for the first time in my life I felt uglyâ¦.all the girls turned to look my wayâ¦this time it wasnât because of my charming smile or killer looksâ¦but the stench of urine all over me and the numerous bruises I had all over my faceâ¦  Like a zombie I made my way out, slowly lugging my tired body out Mc Donaldâs until somebody approached meâ¦  âExcuse me sirâ¦â a man askedâ¦he was wearing the Mc Donaldâs uniform and he had a badge on the left side of his chest labeled âmanagerââ¦.  Drowsily I turned my head signaling him to go onâ¦  âIâm sorry but the customers have complained about youâ¦Iâve been informed that you knocked over their food while you apparently rushed into the gentsâ toiletsâ¦â he said in an accusing toneâ¦  My heart began to thumpâ¦donât tell me he was going to make me payâ¦I groaned to myself not wishing to part with my moneyâ¦  âUmmâ¦you have the wrong guyâ I said quickly while I motioned to the door again like a zombieâ¦.  He held me back with his hand before quickly withdrawing it away in disgustâ¦my shirt was soaked in toilet waterâ¦it didnât smell nice at allâ¦  âPlease sirâ¦if you would kindly pay the amount of $30.00 for the food that you spilt it would be appreciatedâ¦please donât lie to me or Iâll have to take you to the police stationâ¦I can understand that you had a major case of diarrhea or something like that but the customers want justiceâ¦â the man saidâ¦  I was horrified and extremely embarrassedâ¦they think I had diarrhea!!!...OMGâ¦my swollen face turned even redder than beforeâ¦I wanted to get out of Mc Donaldâs as soon as possible but seeing as the stupid manager wouldnât let me leave I quickly rummaged through my pants pocket to find my walletâ¦  To my horror and shock I couldnât find it anywhere.....i checked both pockets of my baggy jeans and to no avail I found nothingâ¦not even my cell phone was in thereâ¦my eyes widened in shock as I began to panicâ¦what the hell was going onâ¦this wasnât the best day obviouslyâ¦  The managerâs piercing eyes made my forehead drip with beads of sweatâ¦he impatiently waited for me to pay the feeâ¦while I rummaged for my walletâ¦where was it?!  Finally I gave upâ¦slowly I withdrew my hand from my pocket and gave the manager a nervous laughâ¦he stared at me obviously not impressed at all while he tapped his foot continuously on the freshly mopped tilesâ¦  âHold onâ¦I seem to have left my wallet in the bathroomâ   I made a bolt for it to the bathroom hoping that my wallet was thereâ¦I clearly recall that the bulky guy hadnât taken my moneyâ¦or my cellâ¦when I reached the bathroom I slowly pushed the door open which made a squeaky sound from the old hingesâ¦ I searched in every toilet dorm and every table sinkâ¦nothingâ¦nothingâ¦thatâs when I remembered that lesbian girlâ¦urgHâ¦.silently I cursed to myself coming up with the conclusion that she had mugged me when she bumped into meâ¦damn her!...  I glumly walked out of the gentsâ toilets and back to the awaiting hands of the managerâ¦today just wasnât my day at allâ¦first I get bashedâ¦then told to part with my moneyâ¦and now I find out that Iâve been muggedâ¦I sighed to myself not feeling good at allâ¦if I ever see that girl again sheâll payâ¦.  The day didnât turn out as I had plannedâ¦the manager made me work off the $30 I owedâ¦I didnât do much of a good job thoughâ¦I practically slowed down his business and I drove the customers away with my fowl stenchâ¦I felt like I was on showâ¦all these hot girls walked in and out of Mc Donaldâs pointing at me and laughingâ¦I promised myself I would seek revenge on that girl if it was the last thing I didâ¦    CHAPTER 2  [Ben's P.O.V.] At the end of the day I was fully exhaustedâ¦I drove home to my apartment and tiredly opened my apartment door #463â¦as I got in the lights were already onâ¦now what is it? As a frown appeared on my faceâ¦this just wasnât my day to get burgledâ¦then I heard laughterâ¦the T.V. was onâ¦  My eyes widened in panic as I got a nearby beer bottle from the table that I had finished off last nightâ¦slowly I crept beside the wall and neared the T.Vâ¦who ever it was, they were pretty stupid to laugh so loud in my homeâ¦  âHAHAHAHAHAâ the laughter rang through my whole houseâ¦  Just as I was about to strikeâ¦something stopped meâ¦wait a secondâ¦that laugh sounds familiarâ¦I scratched my head in deep concentrationâ¦where had I heard that laugh fromâ¦that same high-pitched girly laughâ¦Tonti!!!...  I smirked to myself knowing I had got him this timeâ¦as usual Tonti, who lived right across from my door had let himself in againâ¦his T.V. was broken and knowing Tonti he was to lazy to get it fixedâ¦he had a room mate tooâ¦Jakeâ¦we were all friends around hereâ¦our other buddyâs lived a few doors downâ¦the short guy. Rainer lived at #465â¦ Blue was at #466, right next door to Tonti and Jake and Retchi lived with Blueâ¦he was the baby out of usâ¦  I thought of an evil plan and smirked at myself thinking I had got him this timeâ¦slowly I crept behind the living room couch and switched the light offâ¦Tonti just sat there dumbfounded wondering what was going onâ¦  Thatâs when I pounced on himâ¦  âARGHhHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! RAPIST!!!â Tonti yelled at the top of his lungsâ¦  I covered his mouth with my hand trying to muffle his soundsâ¦this was way too much fun...knowing Tontiâ¦he kicked and screamed like a baby trying to fight me offâ¦  âSMELLY RAPIST!!!!...HELP!!!! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â He yelled againâ¦  He must have escaped from my graspâ¦his screams were so screeching I would of punched him in the face if he wasnât my friendâ¦suddenly somebody pounced on me and threw me on the groundâ¦.  âARGH!!!â I shrieked as I landed on the floor with a thudâ¦I grabbed my side, aching in painâ¦what the hell was going onâ¦who was that?...  âGet him!!!â Tonti yelledâ¦  Somebody threw a blanket of some sort over my face as I yelled in astonishmentâ¦what the hell?...  Now it was my turn of tortureâ¦Somebody pounced on me while I was still in shockâ¦and Iâm guessing Tonti joined inâ¦  âAHHhHH!!! Get OFF!!!!!!!!!!!â I yelled threw the blanket as they started beating meâ¦  Tonti was going to die for thisâ¦.  Between the blanket and the other twoâ¦I could hear faint soundsâ¦they seemed to be talking about meâ¦  âWhat are we going to do with the burglar?â a guy saidâ¦he sounded like Jakeâ¦  âI donât knowâ¦who ever he isâ¦he sure is dangerousâ¦did you see that?!! He almost raped me for Godâs sake!!! Heâs probably been stalking meâ¦who knowsâ¦even fantasizing!!!â Tonti shrieked in panic  âI donât knowâ¦should we call Ben and tell him about the psycho?â Jake said not knowing what to doâ¦  Obviously he was over exaggerating like usualâ¦I sighed to myself before taking a deep breathâ¦  âSHIN TONTI AND DHONGWAN JAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR FAT ASSES OFF OF ME BEFORE I BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU FOR RUINING MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â I roared at the top of my lungsâ¦  I must have startled the two and they immediately jumped off of my ribs enabling me to breathe in regularlyâ¦  I pulled the covers off of my face as the lights soon turned on and blinded meâ¦as I adjusted to the light I met the gaze of Jake and Tonti wide-eyed and mouths dropped at the sight of meâ¦  âBEN!!!!!!!!!â they both cried in unisonâ¦  âWHAT?!â I said back rather rudelyâ¦  âd-did we do THATâ¦.â Tonti said while glancing at Jake then back at meâ¦  I groaned to myself and got up with a heavy sighâ¦this just wasnât my dayâ¦Tonti followed me along with Jakeâ¦they continued to observe my face taking a good look at the bruises that I got from the bulky guy in the gentâs roomâ¦  I ignored there stares and went to the bathroom to have a long shower before going to bedâ¦today was a long dayâ¦and if I ever saw that girl again Iâd show her a piece of my mindâ¦     CHAPTER 3  [Nickyâs P.O.V.] Before I went to workâ¦I noticed a stupid looking guy walking towards me...he seemed like the perfect person to mugâ¦I meanâ¦donât get me wrongâ¦Itâs not as if I want to steal from anyoneâ¦itâs because I have toâ¦ever since I left the orphanage and when times are hard I have to do it every now and thenâ¦it sure beats being a whoreâ¦  When I âaccidentallyâ bumped into him he called me sexyâ¦I mean...what sort of a lame pick up line is thatâ¦little did that bimbo know that he had just been muggedâ¦I smirked to myself as I thought of what had happenedâ¦  After I took his wallet and cell phone I rummaged through his wallet to find out his name was Benjamin Uyâ¦he seemed like a rich guy judging by the way he walkedâ¦soon I found out I was way offâ¦WHAT?! Only $5?!...this guy must be a pimp if he only has 5 in his wallet but dresses like a rich assâ¦what an idiotâ¦  Of course I was disappointed to only see 5 bucksâ¦I meanâ¦how was that going to pay for the rent that I owedâ¦I frowned to myself as I thought about what I had didâ¦ mugging someone who was as poor as meâ¦I felt guiltyâ¦.  I went to work at 11:00pmâ¦the usual timeâ¦well the pay was goodâ¦but I always got it lateâ¦which wasnât very goodâ¦what could you expect for being a âbar girlââ¦I worked at Crystal Barâ¦I donât know why I took the job thoughâ¦I guess I was desperateâ¦the people there were alright and they treated me pretty nicelyâ¦but that wasnât enoughâ¦after allâ¦I did lose my dignityâ¦  I worked till early morning until 4:00amâ¦it was always like this for meâ¦I was always the fill-in girl as well if people were busyâ¦I needed all the money I gotâ¦and that was only for the rent and bills that needed to be paidâ¦the grueling hours at work were endlessâ¦constantly being harassed and hooted at wasnât what I pictured my dreamâ¦I donât think it would be any girls dreamâ¦  Some guys offered me some cashâ¦but of course, knowing guysâ¦they always wanted something in returnâ¦I cherished that little bit of dignity I had left in me thoughâ¦never would I stoop so lowâ¦I told myselfâ¦so thatâs how I came into the stealing businessâ¦I only did it occasionally when times were hardâ¦  After a while of thoughtâ¦I decided to sell the walletâ¦I easily sold it to a stupid guy who paid $50 for itâ¦I grinned to myself happilyâ¦knowing $50 would last me a whileâ¦I got $100 a night for working and I went to work every chance I gotâ¦I guess you could say that would be more than enoughâ¦but to meâ¦it wasnâtâ¦I hated the job but it kept me aliveâ¦I wanted to create my dreamâ¦.to create a future for myselfâ¦to start new and go to collegeâ¦to get a decent jobâ¦  When my shift was over I went home to my small apartmentâ¦.i punched in the number code and slowly dragged my tired body up to the elevatorâ¦I pushed in the 5th level as the doors closedâ¦  When I finally reached the right floor I slowly pulled my body forward while leaning against the wall half asleep to #005 my apartment numberâ¦ when I got in, I managed to make it to my bedroom and I slumped on my bedâ¦.i was so tiredâ¦it was how it always wasâ¦I fell asleepâ¦.  When I woke up it was 3:00pmâ¦I yawned and stretched my arms out feeling more refreshedâ¦I still had make up on my face and my hair was all ruffled upâ¦scratching my head lazily I walked out of my room to come face to face with my living habitsâ¦I groaned to myself remembering that I had said that I would clean it up yesterdayâ¦  On the floor were scattered clothes and a few empty bottles and chip packetsâ¦on the table was more food and a couple bits of scrap paperâ¦the kitchen sink was a mess with dirty dishes that had been there for God knows how longâ¦I frowned at the disgusting sightâ¦I never noticed how gross it lookedâ¦  Immediately I set to work cleaning everything upâ¦first I picked up all the empty bottles and chip packets before throwing away the scrap pieces of paperâ¦I borrowed a vacuum cleaner from my next door neighbour who was a kind old ladyâ¦I got to work in getting every corner and crevice cleanâ¦  I stepped back to admire my effortsâ¦I had to admit, it looked pretty goodâ¦I smiled at my achievement before I glanced at my watchâ¦9:30pmâ¦.I frowned at how fast time had pastâ¦soon Iâd have to go to work againâ¦I sat on my couch and switched on the small T.V. I possessedâ¦aimlessly I flicked the channels and found my favourite show onâ¦Friendsâ¦after the show finished it was 10:30â¦I slumped on the couch comfortably for a while before I decided to make myself something to eatâ¦  Taking out a pack of Nissin noodles I poured some hot water inside a bowl and covered the top with the foilâ¦while I sat on a nearby stool waiting for the noodles to soften I drummed my fingers while staring at the clockâ¦tickâ¦tickâ¦.tickâ¦it was so boringâ¦  When it had been 5 minutes I opened the lid staring at the steaming hot noodlesâ¦my eyes lit up as I breathed in the delicious smellâ¦mmâ¦.yummyâ¦  After I finished my meal I wiped my mouth with my sleeve and gulped down the last of the scrumptious noodlesâ¦I turned to the clock again and saw that it was 11:45 nowâ¦  Quickly I grabbed my jacket and ran out of my house to Crystal Barâ¦I didnât have a car so I had to go everywhere by footâ¦when I finally reached my destination I huffed and puffed loudly trying to catch my breath backâ¦I glanced at my watchâ¦11:55pmâ¦I gave out a sigh of relief knowing that I wasnât lateâ¦  When I entered the bar I was greeted with the usual loud disco music and heavy smell of liquor that always came my wayâ¦the smell was so thick it made me feel like vomiting the first time I worked hereâ¦but now it was a usual routineâ¦  I greeted the bar tender who was also my boss and went to the back to get changedâ¦busily I searched for number 7 on the clothes rackâ¦I managed to find it right at the end and I undressed to my undergarmentsâ¦when I put the skimpy outfit on I felt bare and nakedâ¦I had never gotten used to thatâ¦the uniform barely covered any part of my bodyâ¦it was an extremely tight, not to mention short mini skirt with a tube top which showed my belly buttonâ¦  I sighed to myself and began to apply make upâ¦there was even a special method for applying it onâ¦I was told to apply a large amount of bright red lipstick to match my outfit with a lot of blush on the cheeksâ¦I might not be a whoreâ¦but I sure feel like oneâ¦  After I finished with my make up I walked out of the dressing room back to the crazy drunks outsideâ¦I envied the rich guys and girls who came hereâ¦they came to party, drink and go wildâ¦they had no idea what kind of future they were throwing aroundâ¦of course there were the occasional girls would make rude remarks about meâ¦they always insulted the less fortunate peopleâ¦they made me so angryâ¦once I slapped one of themâ¦the boss warned me if I ever did that again Iâd get firedâ¦as much as I wanted to lash out at them, I needed the job for the money so I kept quiteâ¦they would always refer to the less fortunate asâ¦ âPeople like youââ¦  After I served a few more beers and to people at tables a group of guys walked inâ¦I noticed one of them instantlyâ¦the guy I had muggedâ¦suddenly I began to panic but I kept my cover and went around serving beers to people while I secretly eyed them making sure I was a far distance from themâ¦  The bar tender told me to serve table 4âs drinks...and I quietly obeyed taking the order and walking towards number 4â¦to my shock and horrorâ¦it was that idiotâs tableâ¦  I quickly placed the drinks on the table and briskly walked awayâ¦I let out a deep sigh of relief thinking I had gotten away with being caughtâ¦.untilâ¦  âHeyâ¦you with the red mini skirtâ¦.come back hereâ¦â it was that idiotâs voice againâ¦  Beads of sweat began to drip from my forehead and my heart began to beat faster and fasterâ¦slowly I turned around hoping he didnât remember meâ¦    CHAPTER 4  [Ben's P.O.V.] The guys and I decided to go to Crystal Bar the next dayâ¦I gave Tonti and Jake the impression that they had damaged my faceâ¦they wanted to make it up to me and take me outâ¦obviously I agreed, who would pass up the opportunity of FREE drinks?...besides, my wallet and phone was stolenâ¦  Iâm a cheap guyâ¦yes, I can admit itâ¦to myself of courseâ¦not to anyone elseâ¦well, yes I flirt but I donât buy drinks for girlsâ¦I expect them to buy drinks for meâ¦hahahaâ¦I mean, why should I buy drinks for girlsâ¦itâs meant to be the manly thing but most girls who hang around bars are usually rich anywayâ¦they can afford to part with their moneyâ¦  Iâm not in debt or anythingâ¦I just donât like wasting moneyâ¦I donât know whyâ¦I just donâtâ¦  When the guys and I finally arrived at Crystal Barâ¦the place was lively with the smell of liquorâ¦people were shouting at each other trying to get a decent conversation starting over the loud DJ music and cheerful screams of young, under-aged girlsâ¦  This was my styleâ¦where I belongâ¦Iâm the heart of the partyâ¦all I have to do is bust a few of my moves and the girls will be hovering over me like Iâm Godâ¦this was my lifeâ¦I was the life of the partyâ¦   Jake and Tonti ordered the beers for usâ¦all the guys were hereâ¦including Rainer, BLue and Retchiâ¦  The bar girl that came over was really hotâ¦I smirked to myself while thinking I had gotten the girls attentionâ¦no, waitâ¦not thinkingâ¦knowingâ¦  To my surprise and astonishmentâ¦she placed down the drinks on the table and leftâ¦she didnât even collect the billâ¦I called out to her and she stopped in her tracksâ¦for a while I thought she was shocked that I, Benjamin Uy had noticed her and she was flatteredâ¦I smirked to myself...satisfied that I still had the charmâ¦  I waited for her to grasp the concept that she had been addressed by âmeâ so she could turn aroundâ¦  Finally she turned around but her head tilted downwards avoiding my eyesâ¦as if she was scared of meâ¦slowly she walking towards my table with the guys againâ¦there was something unusual about herâ¦I felt like I had seen her from somewhereâ¦somewhere recentlyâ¦but I couldnât quite pinpoint whenâ¦  âArenât you going to collect the bill?â I asked her, still trying to remember where I had seen her beforeâ¦  She remained silent not moving an inchâ¦then after a few moments she spokeâ¦  â$13.85 pleaseâ she said in a small muffled voiceâ¦  Tonti had to lean closer to hear herâ¦he sighed loudly seeming fed upâ¦I guess he was in a bad mood because of earlier on when Jake and him had versed each other in rock, scissors, paper to see who had to pay the billâ¦obviously Tonti lost â¦the bar girl noticed his actions but said nothing and kept quietâ¦she most probably assumed that he was annoyed with herâ¦  Her voice sounded so familiarâ¦I was on the brink of finding out where I had seen her beforeâ¦but I just couldnât rememberâ¦  âI guess your new hereâ¦I donât know why a girl like you is doing here but next time, donât forget to collect the bill or youâll be in trouble with your bossâ¦okay?â Tonti saidâ¦noticing that he had acted rather rudely beforeâ¦he gave her a warm smile after handing her the moneyâ¦  Thatâs it!!!...I know who she is!!...that girl who had mugged meâ¦I smirked to myself knowing I had got her this timeâ¦I opened my mouth to show her a piece of my mind, when she interruptedâ¦  âThatâs right!!! You wouldnât know anything about why a girl like âMEâ is doing here so mind your own bloody business!!! .you donât even know anything about meâ¦you have no ideaâ¦all you guys are just a bunch of rich assholes who donât appreciate the great advantages you have in life!!!â she burst out in aggravationâ¦emphasizing the word âMeâ as if Tonti was judging herâ¦  Tonti's eyes widened in shock at how the girl had changed all of a suddenâ¦first she was quite and seemed unsure of herselfâ¦but now she was fired upâ¦I was surprised myselfâ¦  'L-lookâ¦I didnât mean it that way okayâ¦and please donât assume weâre that kind of peopleâ¦you donât know usâ¦and we donât know youâ¦â Tonti said calming down a littleâ¦  Tonti and Blue could manage their temper so easily out of all of usâ¦Jake was quite calm but he had a temper problem sometimesâ¦  Rainer became cold and distant ever since he lost his girlfriend Eugeneâ¦she was murdered and he was there when it happenedâ¦heâs never been the same ever sinceâ¦at that time he kept rambling on about remembering his past life or somethingâ¦he was adopted when he was small by Derekâs parentsâ¦he used to live with Derek, his adopted brother...but he decided he needed some space and moved into an apartment next to us guysâ¦  I donât have a temper problemâ¦but I can get rather cocky when Iâm in a bad moodâ¦and I really want to show that bar girl a piece of my mindâ¦not to mention get my wallet and cell phone back from herâ¦  The girlâs annoyed expression soon calmed down to a frown crease on her foreheadâ¦I figured that she new Tonti was right and now she was regretting what she had said rather rudelyâ¦  This time it was my turn to have a go at herâ¦but I wasnât going to be nice or polite to her like Tonti wasâ¦this time it was going to get messyâ¦  I stood up from my seat and confronted her, putting on my meanest face everâ¦I had practiced my âmeanâ face in the mirror beforeâ¦I new what I looked like to other people when I had the expression on my faceâ¦my forehead was creased and my eyebrows arched inwardâ¦  Once I had showed Rainer my âmeanâ face asking what he thoughtâ¦ever since Eugeneâ¦he had developed the most coldest and cruelest expressions you could imagine...the feedback I got from him wasnât very nice thoughâ¦his exact words wereâ¦ âYou look constipated like your dying to go to the toiletâ¦now go awayââ¦  With that he walked away leaving the rest of the guys laughing their heads off and clutching their chests trying to suppress their laughterâ¦I wasnât very happy obviouslyâ¦but I knew better then to mess with Rainerâ¦he was deadly when in a bad moodâ¦but he was scary almost all of the timeâ¦none of us guys messed with himâ¦we knew better than thatâ¦  Snapping back to realityâ¦in front of me was a blank expression coming from the girlâ¦    CHAPTER 5  [Benâs P.O.V.] âWHAT?!â she soon snapped at me noticing my unwelcoming facial expressionâ¦  I had to admitâ¦when she was annoyed or angryâ¦she looked hotâ¦but I was never going to tell her thatâ¦I wouldnât give her the satisfactionâ¦  âDonât âwhatâ me girly...give me back my cell phone and wallet!!!â I yelled back at her annoyed at the disrespect she was showingâ¦  Not to mention if any hot girls were watching right nowâ¦they would lose interest in me because I was shouting at a girlâ¦which wasnât manly or gentlemen like at allâ¦but who knowsâ¦I might catch the attention of some girls tooâ¦some chicks like to see a man being dominantâ¦I smirked to myself thinking of the up side of this little shouting contestâ¦  The bar girls face became as white as a ghostâ¦I guess she knew I had got her thereâ¦gathering up her senses she spoke againâ¦  âI donât know what youâre talking aboutâ¦leave me alone!!!â she said motioning that she was leaving the sceneâ¦  âDonât think you can get away so easily you lesbian!!!â¦not this timeâ¦Iâm not as stupid as you thinkâ¦you know EXACTLY what Iâm talking about!!!...Come back here...and give me back my stuff you thief!!!â I yelled at her retreating figureâ¦  She stopped moving and turned aroundâ¦by now the whole bar had gone silent and everyone was listening in on our conversationâ¦our voices were louder then the DJ musicâ¦all eyes were on the girl nowâ¦I guess she didnât like the spotlightâ¦I smirked to myself knowing that I had the upper hand this timeâ¦  âHOW DARE YOU CALL ME A LESBIANâ¦HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOU SICK PERVERTâ¦LEAVE ME ALONE!!!â she yelled back in aggravationâ¦  I donât believe this girlâ¦she knows exactly what Iâm talking about and she still denies itâ¦how stupidâ¦Jeezâ¦what an idiotâ¦itâs a shame that sheâs hot thoughâ¦  I was about to yell back at her when the boss came across hoping to break up the brawl that we were havingâ¦I guess he had noticed that the whole bar had gotten silent and all eyes were on his bar girl and customerâ¦who was obviously meâ¦  âAlrightâ¦calm down pleaseâ¦what seems to be the problemâ¦?â the man saidâ¦making eye contact with the bar girl more then meâ¦  It was clear that he addressing me thoughâ¦  âTell that lesbian of a bar girl give me back my thingsâ¦she stole them the other dayâ¦!!!â I ordered himâ¦obviously unhappyâ¦  The boss nodded to meâ¦signaling me to wait a few moments while he discussed the situation with the lesbian girlâ¦  After a few moments of small mumbles and whispersâ¦the girl carried a smirk on her faceâ¦what was going on?...  I looked at the boss of Crystal Bar demanding an explanation from himâ¦  âMy employee tells me that she has never met you beforeâ¦and that you tried to assault her a few moments agoâ¦and your story is a way to cover up your harassingâ¦â the Boss informed meâ¦  By now I was fuming with rageâ¦what the hell?!!...assault her?!!...Iâm not that stupidâ¦Jeezâ¦who does this guy think he isâ¦and who does she think she is?!...no wonder she had such a smug look on her faceâ¦URghâ¦damn that girl  âBULLSHIT!!!...sheâs making shit up!!!...if she doesnât return my things Iâll sue your bar for all itâs worth!!!â I said in a threatening voiceâ¦all the other guys joined in and supported me saying that the girl was making things upâ¦  Of course I donât have a lawyerâ¦but itâs not like the guy knows that I donâtâ¦besidesâ¦he wouldnât jeopardize his business reputation would he?...I smirked secretly to myself knowing that I would get what I wantâ¦  The bossâs forehead creased in stress and he frowned desperately trying to find a solutionâ¦after a whileâ¦he let out a sigh of defeatâ¦  âAlrightâ¦alrightâ¦but my employee says she didnât take anything of yoursâ¦what do you propose I do?â he asked me trying to negotiateâ¦  This time it was my turn to put a smug look on my faceâ¦I knew exactly what I wanted and she couldnât stop me nowâ¦no one couldâ¦  I scratched my chin which was forming new stubsâ¦I smirked to myself...knowing that everyoneâs attention was on me...and the fate of the girl was in my handsâ¦even the bar girl remained silent waiting for me to decide her fateâ¦she knew she had lostâ¦and I knew it tooâ¦this was too much funâ¦  As the anticipated waiting continuedâ¦I decided to break the tensionâ¦  âFire herâ I said flatlyâ¦with an evil look on my faceâ¦  He turned around to face the girlâ¦obviously delivering the rejectionâ¦the girls face fumed with hatred and annoyance towards meâ¦with her cold eyes she looked at the bosses frown and creased forehead.  âFINE!!!...I quit anyway!!!!ââ¦with that she stormed out and grabbed her thingsâ¦  After a while...everything died down and people began to dance againâ¦I was rightâ¦I had caught the attention of more girls than I had imaginedâ¦they must of automatically assumed that I was rich and powerful...if I could sue the bar for all itâs moneyâ¦I was loving the attention and devoured every single bit of affection or lustful stare given my wayâ¦  This was too good to be trueâ¦I was surrounded by so many hot girlsâ¦and then came the saying in my head againâ¦one that I had always told myselfâ¦  âIâ¦Benjamin Uyâ¦am literally a chick magnetâ¦â    CHAPTER 6  [Nicky's P.O.V.]  can't believe that prick!!! Who the hell does he think he is?!   This just isn't my dayâ¦getting fired because of that a*shole!!!...  He just made me so madâ¦if I ever see him againâ¦I swear he'll get a piece of my mindâ¦and I'll make sure it doesn't end pretty...  I grinded my teeth together in rage and formed fists with my handsâ¦bystanders stared at me like I was a psychoâ¦I didn't blame them though-picture thisâ¦I'm walking in God knows how high, platforms with an extremely tight and short mini skirt with a tight, revealing red tube top to matchâ¦  A guy hooted at me and whistledâ¦my eyes fired up with rage and I shot him a cold, evil glareâ¦his face went deathly white and he backed away from me not wishing to get involvedâ¦  I scowled at him menacingly and stormed off in an extremely pissed off moodâ¦that loser at the bar was going to payâ¦I don't know when, but I was going to make sure he was going to payâ¦now how was I going to pay the rent that I owed with no jobâ¦  I stopped in my tracksâ¦I'm not going to put up with thisâ¦why should he get away with ruining my lifeâ¦he was going to payâ¦all I am is all talk and no actionâ¦I should make him pay shouldn't I?...I smirked to myself wondering what evil plan I would come up withâ¦  'Nice legs baby!' a guy hollered at meâ¦while whistlingâ¦  I snapped out of my thoughts and glared at the guy with cold, glassy eyes in a threatening way hinting him to back away if he knew what was good for himâ¦  'Reow!!!...Feistyâ¦I like that in a girl!' the prick said in a seductive tone trying to impersonate a catâ¦  I was beginning to lose my temper with himâ¦he picked the wrong day to mess with me... 'How much you charging?' he said in a dirty toneâ¦  By now I was fuming with aggravation â¦my eyes were fired up with annoyance and angerâ¦what the hellâ¦he thought I was a whore that A**hole!!!...  'Dare say that againâ¦?' I said in a cold, raspy whisperâ¦motioning towards him taking small stepsâ¦  'I said how mu-' He attempted to repeat himself but I couldn't take it anymoreâ¦  This loser was really pissing me off and I had given him all the possible hints to tell him to back offâ¦what a pigâ¦  I backed away from him escaping from the body heat he was giving off and I drew my arm back and punched him in the face as hard as I couldâ¦.  'I'm not a whore so why don't you just mind your own f*cking business!!!!!!' I yelled back at him in rageâ¦  Everyone on the street was staring at me now in utter shock and silenceâ¦it was completely silent besides the cries of pain from the loser I had punchedâ¦  I glared at each and everyone's face with disgustâ¦people only new to assumeâ¦just because I was wearing this kind of outfit people thought I was a whoreâ¦did I look like a whore? Was I walking like a whore? Did it look like I was practically throwing myself at everyone who was passing by?  My whole body filled up with rage and hatred for the whole worldâ¦it felt like it had turned its back on me that I was the only sane one in this stupid societyâ¦why did this have to happen to me?  'What are all of you looking at?! Haven't you seen a girl hit a guy before?!! Mind your own F*cking business if you don't want to end up like this loser!!!' I screamed at the top of my lungs shooting an evil glare around me to the people who had formed a circle around me at a distanceâ¦  They remained to have blank faces but soon shuffled around and quickly dispersed and scattered back to their own businessâ¦  I huffed and puffed trying to catch my breath backâ¦while my eyes remained wide on guard for any sudden movementsâ¦After I had regained my senses I decided to go back to the bar and vent out my anger on the loserâ¦as well as collect my last pay check from Crystal Barâ¦  My platforms clinked on the cold concrete floor as I stomped off in rageâ¦when I reached the bar it was 3:00am alreadyâ¦it was amazing how time passed by so quicklyâ¦but that wasn't important to me right nowâ¦  Just as I thoughtâ¦the bar was still lively with the loud DJ music on and the heavy smell of liquor wafting in the airâ¦when I entered nobody seemed to notice me which was good because I was in one of my fits and if anyone shot me a weird stare or look I would literally vent my anger on themâ¦which wouldn't be good because I was intending to let it all out on that prick who got me firedâ¦I think his name was Benjamin Uy or somethingâ¦his driver's license photo wasn't very attractiveâ¦he had a pot-head hair cutâ¦I mean, what kind of a girl would find a pot-head hair cut appealing to her tasteâ¦sheeshâ¦  I trudged to the bar and asked for the managerâ¦his name was Brian Jooâ¦he was a pretty decent guyâ¦really hotâ¦I guess he attracted all the female customersâ¦but I was never interested in himâ¦though he might seem like a down to earth guyâ¦how could he be if he owned such a bar which seemed to focus on the bar girls wearing such outfitsâ¦  Brian and I were on good termsâ¦but he had once told me that his business came firstâ¦and he didn't develop friendships with his employeesâ¦I had nodded my head in reply not wishing to question his motivesâ¦although I never admitted it I considered him as my only friendâ¦and now that I was fired by himâ¦my only friend at thatâ¦you can obviously see why I'm in such an aggravated state of mind right nowâ¦  I understand why Brian fired me thoughâ¦like he saidâ¦'business comes first'â¦  'Hey Nickyâ¦sorry about beforeâ¦you understand why I did it though right?' Brian's warm voice seeped into my skin and I began to soften upâ¦  'Yeahâ¦I understandâ¦' I said softly turning to the side not wishing to look him in the eyesâ¦somehow Brian always seemed to calm me down and make me feel betterâ¦it was like a special bond I shared with him that was never expressed through wordsâ¦  I took a deep breath in and inhaled the thick smell of liquor before speaking againâ¦  'Lookâ¦I'm sorry about beforeâ¦I didn't mean to cause a scene or anythingâ¦I just came for my last pay check and I'll get out of your wayâ¦' I said glancing at him and then at the floorâ¦  I could feel Brian's eyes filled with pity and sorrow on meâ¦after a few minutes he disappeared to the backâ¦  I remained still and stared at my feetâ¦I didn't want to face himâ¦I wanted to get away from him as soon as possibleâ¦no one had ever seen me cry before and I didn't want him toâ¦  I had shut everybody out of my lifeâ¦and that was how I wanted to keep itâ¦I didn't want to love anyoneâ¦trust anyoneâ¦or open up to anyoneâ¦this was just the way I wasâ¦I guess I pushed everyone awayâ¦  From time to time I would wonderâ¦is that why I'm not loved?...is this why I don't have any friends?...I never really knew whyâ¦and while I was growing up at the orphanage the nuns would try to encourage me to join in with the other kidsâ¦but I never wanted toâ¦I didn't think I belongedâ¦that they would accept me for who I wasâ¦that I'd be criticized and ridiculed just for beingâ¦.just for beingâ¦being meâ¦.  Just like my parents didn't want meâ¦didn't accept meâ¦they didn't think I belongedâ¦I meanâ¦isn't that the reason why they left meâ¦gave me up for adoption that is?...  Brian soon came back with a small white envelopeâ¦he handed it to meâ¦and I extended my hand for him to place it inâ¦  I lowered my head in shame and disgust with myselfâ¦ 'Thanksâ¦bye Brianâ¦' I said in a soft muffled whisper while turning to leaveâ¦  Slowly I walked out of the bar and squinted back the tears that were on the verge of falling from my eyesâ¦a tear escaped my eye and fell on the floor with a plop on the floorâ¦  'Nickyâ¦' Brian's voice came back to my headâ¦  I had never felt so down in my lifeâ¦I raised my head and took a deep breathâ¦before I turned around I wiped my tears with my free handâ¦after taking a few sniffs I turned around ready to face Brianâ¦  'Yeahâ¦' I said plastering a happy face onâ¦  'I'llâ¦I'll need the outfit backâ¦' He said in a soft voiceâ¦  My heart sankâ¦and I remembered I was still wearing the slutty costume, not to mention make upâ¦  I nodded my head in reply and walked back to the change rooms with my shoulders slumpedâ¦Brian new I took the job because money was a problem for meâ¦I guess he felt sorry for meâ¦but there was nothing he could do nowâ¦his reputation would be at stake if he took me backâ¦I had to learn to understand this and live with itâ¦  As I disappeared in the shadows to the doorâ¦the sensation of feeling Brian's eyes on my back died down and I relaxed a bit moreâ¦  After I changed back to my T-shirt and jeans, washed my face getting rid of the make up and brushed my hairâ¦I looked pretty okayâ¦it didn't look like I had been crying which was a good thingâ¦and the only thing on my mind now was getting back at that Benjamin guyâ¦  I walked out of the changing room after hanging up my outfitâ¦well it wouldn't be my outfit anymore I guessâ¦  With a determined face I confronted the outside bar againâ¦  'The outfits on the rackâ¦' I told Brian while I searched for Ben and his bimbo friendsâ¦  'It's been fun working with you and I'm going to miss youâ¦take care aiite?' Brian said nodding his headâ¦  I seemed to have cut him off with my head bobbing up and down busily searching for Benâ¦  My concentration was broken when a hand waved in my faceâ¦my expression soon changed to an annoyed oneâ¦  'What?!' I snapped at the person not bothering to see who it wasâ¦  'Ummâ¦are you okay Nickyâ¦?' Brian's voice sounded in my ears againâ¦  My expression soon turned soft as I turned to face Brian with a sorry face for snapping at himâ¦  'Ohâ¦uhâ¦I'm alrightâ¦' I replied not really paying attentionâ¦  My expression soon turned to a satisfied one when I spotted the bimbo crew dancing on the dance floorâ¦  I began to make my way towards Ben who was really sweating it out on the floorâ¦I had to admit he had pretty good moves for a complete idiotâ¦I smirked to myself knowing I was going to catch him in complete surpriseâ¦  I was a couple metres within totally bashing it out with him until a warm hand held me back on the shoulderâ¦  I turned around to face the person who had interfered with my plansâ¦with an annoyed expression Brian was my interfererâ¦  'Don't do this now Nickyâ¦I know you want revengeâ¦but not hereâ¦' Brian said giving me a contempt sighâ¦  He seemed to have caught up with my evil planâ¦I gave him a *don't-mess-with-me* look telling him to back offâ¦  'Nickyâ¦don't give me that lookâ¦you know perfectly how it's going to endâ¦I know he seems like a totally insensitive prick and your really ticked off with himâ¦but not here Nickyâ¦now isn't the best timeâ¦' Brian said understandingly trying to negotiate and reason with meâ¦  My face soon softened under his stare and I gave out a defeated groanâ¦  'Fine fineâ¦I won't nowâ¦but soonâ¦believe me soonâ¦' I said informing Brian that he had managed to cool me down for a whileâ¦but it wasn't going to lastâ¦not for long that isâ¦  With that I walked out of the barâ¦still determined to show that loser who he was messing withâ¦    CHAPTER 7  [Benâs P.O.V. I laughed and danced through the whole nightâ¦The guys and I had split up, I had no idea where they were by nowâ¦I didnât really care though  I walked out of the bar with Amy (a girl I had met in the bar) in my arm and a beer bottle in the other, we walked in the cold night towards my car, she lightly smacked me on my chest and I chuckled light heartedly at her attempt to hurt me.  As we neared the car her soft giggles died down and her face went blankâ¦noticing her change I glanced towards my car and the blood instantly drained from my faceâ¦  It was the feisty girl who tried to pick a fight with me in the bar, she probably wanted revengeâ¦I secretly smirked to myself gathering my sense back, knowing she couldnât do anything to meâ¦  Her expression was blank and dullâ¦I couldnât seen to find any signs of anger or annoyance in themâ¦she seemed like a zombieâ¦Amy twitched and wriggled under my arm, I could tell she was uncomfortable under the feisty girlâs stareâ¦I had to admit, I was rather intimidated and felt uneasy as well.  I plastered a brave expression on my face and gave Amy a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder and a flash of my stunning smile, she smiled uneasily and looked towards the girl againâ¦  We began to saunter towards my car, Amyâs heels clicked on the concrete floor steadily as we neared the girl, while we walked she never took her dull, glassy eyes off of meâ¦although I loved the feeling of girls checking me outâ¦somehow I didnât get the impression that was what she was doingâ¦  Nervously I looked around pretending not to notice her, I couldnât shake her stare off, or the uneasiness that lingered in the airâ¦Amy fidgeted around awkwardly not liking her stare eitherâ¦  The feisty girl was leaning on my car door, she seemed laid back but as cold as stoneâ¦it was a frightful feelingâ¦  When we were a metre away from each other I stopped and stood there with an unwelcoming expression on my face, she continued to stare at me with glassy, cold eyesâ¦  What was this girlâs problem? I wondered to myselfâ¦Is she always like this?...sheeSh..She needs to get a life  We stood there in complete silence, to any stranger we would have seemed like we were having a staring contestâ¦I looked at her menacingly and she shot me an icy cold glare, if this WAS a staring contest I was getting the feeling that she was winningâ¦  The silence was awkward and eerie, I didnât like the surroundings eitherâ¦I mean, I donât mean to sound like a sissy girl butâ¦there was no one around and it was past midnight alreadyâ¦the only people in sight were Amy and the other girlâ¦  Luckily I was half drunk so I wasnât really in tune...although I knew perfectly what was going onâ¦I regretted not drinking more alcoholâ¦it would have made me feel better and not so high strungâ¦  âWhat do you want?â I asked her, deciding to break the deathly silenceâ¦  She ignored my question and continued to glare at meâ¦boy, this girl had serious issues to deal withâ¦not only was she a lesbian she was also a weirdoâ¦coming to the conclusion, I settled for that she was a âBenjamin Uy Fanaticâ  Secretly I smirked to myself knowing there were probably a lot more girls like her around... hopefully nicer though...I sighed to myself feeling contempt that one day they would probably get together and form a âBenjamin Uy Lovers Clubâ¦ BULCââ¦  ***Benâs Dreamy Thoughts***  âAaAaHHHHHHhHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â screamed my fan club  I smirked to myself loving the attentionâ¦this was WAY to cool to be trueâ¦  âOMG..I LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!! MARRY ME!!!â  âNO..MARRY ME!!!...I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT I WOULD DIE FOR YOU!!!!!!!â  âBENJAMIN UY!!! YOUâRE MY HERO!!!â  âAAHhHHHhhH!!!...HE WINKED AT ME!!! DID YOU SEE THAT?!â  Screams of joy filled my earsâ¦it was like heavenâ¦I strutted my stuff and flashed my stunning smile to all the surrounding girls and even did a little pose..the crowd went wild and a couple of my fans faintedâ¦  I winked at them all and even saw a large banner hoisted up in the air readingâ¦ âBENJAMIN UYâ¦OUR LEGENDâ¦â  Again..my motto rang in my mind again...  'I,Benjamin Uy am literally a chick magnet...'  ***End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts***  âLeave usâ¦âa cold raspy whisper sounded in my earâ¦waking me up from my pleasant thoughtsâ¦  I soon found myself back in realityâ¦as the cold dry air blew in my face I noticed Amy was tremblingâ¦I gathered my senses and picked the pieces togetherâ¦ âLeave usâ¦â the voice rang in my head and I assumed that the creepy girl had told Amy to leaveâ¦  She looked at me hesitantly looking for an answerâ¦I decided to let her go, although I was extremely pissed off that I wouldnât be able to have fun tonight I let her goâ¦her facial expression said it allâ¦she didnât want to stay with me at all, especially if the weirdo was aroundâ¦by that Iâm referring to the feisty bar girl...or should I say ex-bar girlâ¦  I tilted my head to a side as I watched Amyâs retreating figureâ¦she walked briskly away while her heels clicked constantly on the cold floorâ¦her hair blew in the cool breezeâ¦The faint sound of her heels died down eventually and I realized how insecure I felt right nowâ¦this girl could be dangerousâ¦  The obvious dangers dawned on me and it didnât feel so good to be near her right nowâ¦especially after the scene at the barâ¦she must have been full-on pissed off at meâ¦although I looked buff and manlyâ¦this girl seemed weirdâ¦and I had a bad feeling about herâ¦     CHAPTER 8  [Benâs P.O.V.] So there I was... all alone with the crazy stalkerâ¦and trust meâ¦it wasnât a nice feelingâ¦  For some reason I felt like one of those spinefex balls would blow past like how they do in corny, old cowboy moviesâ¦  UrgH! What are you talking about Benjamin Uy?!...Your thinking like an idiot nowâ¦you have a serious situation hereâ¦this is your first encounter with a crazed BULC girl!!! Think of a plan you sexy thing!  I wanted to slap myself on the face for being so stupidâ¦you might think Iâd slap myself because I got the girl fired and now she was mega pissed offâ¦butâ¦noâ¦I wouldnât slap myself for thatâ¦neverâ¦it was her fault anyway, I have no feelings of guilt at all towards herâ¦besides, sheâs not worth ruining my face forâ¦  Well as I was sayingâ¦Iâd slap myself for not thinking of an emergency route just incase I encounter fansâ¦I mean, if itâs one fan this time then what about next timeâ¦2? 14? 20?!â¦  Urgh! Benjamin Uy why do you have to be so slow sometimes I thought I had everything coveredâ¦the looks, the fashion statementâ¦the charmâ¦but I forgot the escape route just incase I encounter a Benjamin crazed fan...  âWhat do you want?â I spat.  My voice was full of menace and arroganceâ¦I didnât mean to sound that wayâ¦I guess I was panickingâ¦  Then I thought to myselfâ¦if this was one of my crazed fans then I would have to make a good impressionâ¦she could tell my other fans that I was rude and not all thatâ¦o.0â¦I guess thatâs how it has to go when youâre the sexiest man aliveâ¦*sigh*  âRevengeâ she muttered  âUh-hUhâ¦and how are you going to do that?...youâre not like any fan Iâve seen beforeâ¦instead of revenge I thought you would be worshipping the ground that I walked on, and besides me getting you firedâ¦if I was you, Iâd be thankful that I took notice in youâ¦â I replied back nonchalantlyâ¦while sneeringâ¦  I was beginning to feel at ease and I loosened my muscles while crossing my arms in a pose I had practiced many times in the mirror beforeâ¦I called it my âcool poseâ  Before she could open her mouth to say something I cut her off and started againâ¦this time letting it all outâ¦  âAnd Iâve never seen a fan stoop so lowâ¦honestly, if you wanted something that I possessed why not go to eBay auction?...no need to stealâ¦you donât even act like a fanâ¦the only thing that makes you my fan is that youâve probably been fantasizing about me and stalking me for god knows how longâ¦â I snickered to myself knowing I had got her thereâ¦  Any second now she was going to let it all outâ¦and show me pictures she had taken of me going to my house, going to the shopsâ¦practically anywhere you couldâ¦imagineâ¦maybe even an old Mc Donaldâs foam cup that I had drunken fromâ¦who knows what extremes my fans would go toâ¦  I turned my head to face her because I had been leaning on my car the whole timeâ¦  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  âAwWw...SH*T!!!â I cried out in painâ¦  Did that just happen?!...I thought to myselfâ¦did she just punch me? But I didnât have to answer that, the pain near my eye was enoughâ¦and sheesh...arenât girls meant to slapâ¦not punchâ¦what a tomboy   When I had gathered back my senses, I straightened my figure and stared at her while snarlingâ¦she was really pissing me offâ¦what was with this girl anyway?!  âWhat the Heck was that for?!â I spat out.  Now it was her time to sneer at meâ¦daMmitâ¦I covered my hurt eye hoping I wouldnât have a black eye later on...but the chances were pretty highâ¦this girl could do some serious damage!...she had a lot of strength for a girlâ¦  âWas that your revenge?!â I scowled at her.   She had the biggest smirk on her faceâ¦that pissed me of even moreâ¦If she wasnât a girl I wouldâve hit herâ¦but then againâ¦she could have been a guy cause she had a lot of strengthâ¦and she acted like a guy toâ¦not to mention I thought she was a lesbian, so she couldâve been straight, just that she was a drag queenâ¦  I thought to myself for a moment with a blank expression plastered on my faceâ¦then I inspected her smirking face...she had large hazel eyes, a petite nose and small cherry lipsâ¦all her features seemed to scream out âperfectionâ and âfemininityââ¦  I shook my head vigorously coming to the conclusion that she wasnât a drag queen because she had the figure of a girl tooâ¦*sigh*â¦I settled with the conclusion that she was a tomboyâ¦and again, a âlesbianââ¦obviously because she had punched meâ¦and if my other fans were here...theyâd want to get a piece of herâ¦  I could picture them right nowâ¦  *Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  ***[Rewind]***  *** [Play] ***  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  âAwWw...SH*T!!!â I cried out in painâ¦  *screams* âBenâ¦are you okay?!â   Iâd soon be bombarded with my fansâ¦  âYouâre beautiful face, Oppaâ¦are you okayâ¦â another fan would be close to tears  Others looked like they had been punchedâ¦thatâs how much my fans loved meâ¦*sigh*â¦they felt my pain so much that it hurt themâ¦  A couple of my other fans fainted from the shockâ¦poor girls...I guess it was too much for themâ¦  All of a sudden my fans got upâ¦one by oneâ¦leaving a few of them still comforting me and smothering me with affectionâ¦  âYouâll pay for that you B*tch!â one of them would say  âYeaHâ¦weâre going to teach you not to mess with Benâ¦.who the heck do you think you are anywayâ¦to ruin his sexy faceâ¦youâre going down!!!â another determined fan would yell out  The rest of them chorused in with a â¦ âyEah!â  All of a sudden they were all screaming and charging towards the weirdo fanâ¦*sigh*â¦where would I be without my fan club...  *End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  I was taken back to reality when the ex-bar girl, ex-lesbian and ex-drag queen spokeâ¦wow she was a lot of âexâsâ  âNoâ¦that was just for making up a lot of sh*tâ she snarled in a matter-a-fact tone which pissed me off even moreâ¦  Urgh! I canât stand her!  âGet in the carâ she said, her voice seemed to be calming downâ¦she seemed more feminine nowâ¦  I did as she said thinking that she was going to let me go nowâ¦*phew*â¦this was enough for one dayâ¦as soon as I get home Iâm taking a long showerâ¦  I clicked the alarm and got in my carâ¦while I put on my seatbelt the weird girl opened the passenger door right next to the driverâs seatâ¦  What the hell?!...sheâs not getting in with me! Iâm not that crazyâ¦sheâll probably bash me to a pulpâ¦  She got in the carâ¦and I glared at her mouth-open and eyes wideâ¦what the heck did she want now?!     CHAPTER 9  [Benâs P.O.V.] Againâ¦I thought to fast and I thought I was allowed to goâ¦but here I am againâ¦in a car with some psychoâ¦  âNow what is it?!â I scowled at her while frowningâ¦  Again, she wore the same annoying smirk on her faceâ¦I could tell that she had the upper hand alreadyâ¦obviously she wasnât going to leave me alone unless she got what she wantedâ¦*sigh*â¦she was lucky that I wasnât the abusive type of guy if you know what I mean..  âYou got me firedâ she said in an accusing voice  âYou stole from meâ I said mimicking her tone  âIâm going to be homeless now because of youâ she said accusing me in a louder voiceâ¦  I paused for a few moments taking it all inâ¦homeless? Is that why she stole? Is that why sheâs a bar girl?  It dawned on me why she did all those thingsâ¦and how she was so pissed off at meâ¦bar girls earn quite a lot of money nowadaysâ¦and I got her firedâ¦I was beginning to feel sorry for herâ¦*sigh*â¦â¦she probably needed the money...  But I wasnât going to let her know I felt sorry for her...Iâd probably get another black eyeâ¦â¦it was so unfair thoughâ¦because she was a girl I wasnât allowed to hit herâ¦and that pissed me offâ¦  âYou stole my cell phoneâ I accused her in a challenging way while leaning closer to herâ¦  âBecause of you I lost my only friendâ she said again in aggravationâ¦she leaned closer challenging me back  Retreating my head a few centimetersâ¦I thought of a comebackâ¦HmmSâ¦  âYou stole my wallet!â I accused in a loud voiceâ¦  âThere was only 5 bucks in there anyway you cheap prick!â she yelled at me trying to defend her actionsâ¦  I was taken aback by her words but I managed to find a come back pretty easilyâ¦  âI donât like carrying around a lot of money okay?! And 5 bucks is probably a lot more then you have!â I spat back  As soon as I had finished my sentenceâ¦her face softened and I immediately wished that I hadnât said thatâ¦maybe I was too cruel and harshâ¦  Before I could apologize I got anotherâ¦-  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  Whelpsâ¦I guess you know what happened huh? Yups youâre rightâ¦another black eye *sigh* but this time I deserved itâ¦   âARgh!!! F*ck!â I cried out in agony againâ¦  DaMnâ¦this loony wasnât going to get an apology from me...never, not after my 2nd black eyeâ¦  âSo what the heck do you want now?!â I grimaced at herâ¦hoping to change the subjectâ¦  âLike I saidâ¦revengeâ¦âshe sneered at meâ¦  âYeahâ¦Iâm not stupid you knowâ¦you donât have to repeat yourselfâ¦â I retorted.  âWhat do you want then?â I asked her giving up the fight trying to get it over and done with while covering my â2ndâ black eye...  She snickered at meâ¦urgh! I canât stand herâ¦she pisses me off so much...  âIâll be staying with you for a hundred daysâ¦either that or you give me $100,000â¦your choiceâ she said seeming as though she had thought about it for a whileâ¦  My mouth gaped open not wishing I had heard correctlyâ¦  âW-w-what?â I managed to choke out while stutteringâ¦  Her eyes met mine and she stared at me for a few moments before wearing a big grin from ear to earâ¦  âI thought you said you werenât stupidâ she questioned meâ¦  My face had a blank and confused expression onâ¦what was she talking aboutâ¦  âIâm not stupidâ I retorted back in a matter-a-fact tone  âDidnât you say I didnât have to repeat myself because you werenât stupid?â she asked me already knowing the answerâ¦  âYeahâ¦so?â I replied her curious to what she was getting atâ¦  âWell you wanted me to repeat myself just thenâ she said flatly  I paused for a short while taking it all inâ¦she was right...I didâ¦I wanted to strangle her right nowâ¦dammit...She was so annoying and I hated the fact that she was rightâ¦  âaRgH!...whateverâ I retorted, while crossing my arms like a little boy and facing the other way not wishing to look at herâ¦  âWellâ¦whatâs your choice?â she asked me while slouching on my car seatâ¦  âWhat makes you think that Iâm going to do what you say?!â I snapped  âWellâ¦besides the fact that you stripped me from my only friend, got me fired, and soon Iâm going to be homeless all because of youâ¦I also have your personal belongingsâ¦e.g. your cell phone and driverâs licenseâ¦unless you want people to see Benjamin Uy the man with the afroâ¦then I suggest you agree to my conditionsâ she replied with a big grin plastered on her face.  My eyes grew wide with shockâ¦  âThis is blackmail!â I accused her in disgust.  âDonât you think I already know this?â she sneered at me not expecting an answerâ¦  I thought for a while and spoke againâ¦  âYou knowâ¦your offer is âextremely temptingâ but I think turning you in as a thief to the police seems more satisfyingâ I retorted sarcastically.  I waited to see what she would sayâ¦it didnât really matter thoughâ¦because this time I had the upper handâ¦HuahahAHaâ¦and it felt good tooâ¦  âAre you threatening me?â she said in a low whisper while slowly leaning closer to my faceâ¦  She was so close that I could feel her hot breath on meâ¦  âSo what if I am? You started it by trying to blackmail meâ I snarled in disgust while leaning in closeâ¦we were so close that our noses were millimeters away from touchingâ¦  She paused for a while and gazed into my eyesâ¦then she pulled away and leaned on the car door while facing me inside the carâ¦  She grinned at me and all the while never took her eyes off of meâ¦what was this weirdo up to now?...  âWhat?â I asked her demandingly   âOhâ¦itâs nothingâ¦itâs just that I thought you wouldnât want your drivers license to be enlarged and stuck around the city so everybody could see that humungous, embarrassing afro that you hadâ¦and I thought you would want your cell phone backâ¦thatâs allâ¦nothing muchâ¦â she said casuallyâ¦  With that she turned her body around and opened the car door motioning that she was leavingâ¦  I was flabbergasted by her wordsâ¦but as soon as it sank in...I knew my reputation as being the sexiest man alive would be ruined if she wasnât bluffing...I meanâ¦what would happen to BULC?!...  *Benâs Dreamy Thoughts* âWE LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!!â  âMARRY ME BENJAMIN UY!!!â  âYOUâRE MY HERO!!!â *faints*  âBENâ¦I THINK YOUâRE THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE!!!â  My fans surrounded me with banners and presentsâ¦I donât like to boast or anything but a couple of the banners readâ¦  âBENJAMIN UYâ¦GODâS GIFT TO WOMEN!â  âBENJAMIN UYâ¦OUR LEGENDâ  âSEXY=BENJAMIN UYâ  âI LOVE YOU BENâ¦PLEASE BE MINEâ  I chuckled light heartedlyâ¦to them, I was Godâs giftâ¦*sigh*â¦so perfectâ¦  [Next Day]  Flyer papers were stapled and stuck up anywhere you could imagineâ¦ranging from pink, blue, yellow, white, green and redâ¦  ARgh! My driverâs licenseâ¦and that hideous picture of me!!!..  âHeyâ¦thatâs Benjamin Uyâ¦the guy on those papersâ¦how embarrassingâ¦I feel sorry for himâ I heard a girl sayâ¦  âIsnât that Benjamin Uy...the guy with the afro?â another pointed at me and laughedâ¦  âWowâ¦he sure has changedâ¦and to think I used to like a guy who had an afro!â one of my former fans chuckledâ¦  âNoOoOOooOOoooOooO!!!!!!!!!!â  *End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  âWAIT!!!â I shouted back to the weird girlâs retreating figureâ¦  I wasnât going to let her ruin my reputation...never...how embarrassingâ¦I shook my head vigorously trying to brush the image out of my mindâ¦what a frightful imageâ¦  She turned around and sneeredâ¦it was like she already knew I was going to agree to her conditionsâ¦that pissed me off as wellâ¦how she was always right...and she got her way all the time..â¦urgh!     CHAPTER 10  [Benâs P.O.V.] âSo whatâs your choice?â she snapped againâ¦  I thought for a whileâ¦and obviously I didnât have $100,00â¦I mean...who would have that amount of money...besides some rich person...and obviously Iâm not the richest person in the worldâ¦I donât like to part with my money eitherâ¦Iâm cheap okay?..  â100 daysâ¦â I muttered obviously not happy that she had wonâ¦  She smirked at me satisfied that she had succeeded in getting what she wantedâ¦againâ¦she got in my car and shut the door behind herâ¦  âAfter the 100 daysâ¦I want everything you stole from me back okay?â I snapped at her demandinglyâ¦  âYeah...whateverâ she muttered back while putting her seatbelt onâ¦  I started the engine up in my carâ¦  âWhy do you want to stay with me anyway? I can understand youâre one of my âmanyâ fans and allâ¦but you sure donât act like oneâ¦you act like you despise meâ I retortedâ¦making sure I emphasized the word âmanyâ deliberately in an attempt to piss her off and tell her that she wasnât that great herselfâ¦  I sat there waiting for her to answer my questionâ¦it was quiet for a whileâ¦the engine was still running and that was about the only thing that you could hearâ¦  âThree strikes bimbo!â she hollered  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  âArgH!!! Damn youâ¦youâre really pissing me off you know?!â I scowled at her while clutching my eyeâ¦ (The one she had punched first)  The pain from the first punch was already bad enough...and she just had to punch me againâ¦on the same eye tooâ¦oh noâ¦waitâ¦which ever eye she punched it would be the âsameâ eye anywayâ¦because she had already punched both of my eyesâ¦  âSo what the heck was that punch for?!â I asked her extremely annoyedâ¦  âSimpleâ¦I hate repeating myselfâ¦the answer was ârevengeââ¦at the start I told you I wanted revengeâ¦then you asked me again what I wanted after I punched you the 2nd timeâ¦I told you again that I wanted revengeâ¦then you told me you werenât stupid and that I didnât have to repeat myselfâ¦and here I am againâ¦you want me to repeat myselfâ¦â she snapped at me  I thought back to the previous eventsâ¦againâ¦she was rightâ¦*sigh*â¦that would have been three timesâ¦  âWellâ¦now you know that I donât like to repeat myself three times in a row okay?...if I do repeat myself again then youâre going to get another punch for being an idiotâ¦got it?â she said demandingly  âWhateverâ I muttered under my breathâ¦  I started up the engine again and I drove her to her old apartment to grab her stuffâ¦then we drove to my apartmentâ¦  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Every one of us has a love story to tell, some are very inspirational and some love story was a sad ending. Why am writing this kind of journal? Well, madami kasi akong friend na gustong malaman ang love story ko. Madalas nilang itanong ang tanong na toh, who is this lucky girl??? Where did you meet her??? Well guys if you really want to know just read this journal.  2nd week, June 2002 first day ng class sa AMA University ng nagdecide ang barkada na huwag ng pumasok sa last class namin dahil that time hindi pa naman regular ang class sa AMA. We decided to have a drink in our tambayan (tapat lang ng AMA) puro boys lang kami that time. Around 1:00 or 1:30pm ng may pumasok na girl sa tambayan namin. Sheâs tall around 5â7 to 5â8 ang height, slim, fair complextion, sort hair, parang model na may kakaibang karisma. Sheâs alone that time buying her lunch food, confident and may strong personality. Syempre that time medyo nagulat ako sa character ng girl na pumasok, sabi ko pa nga sa sarili ko noon ang lakas naman ng loob ng babaeng itoh na pumasok sa tambayan ng mga lalaki siguro freshmen or transferee ang babaeng toh. Pero that time alam ko na sa sarili ko na crush ko sya. Lahat kami that time nakatingin sa kanya and siguro napansin nya na may nakatingin sa kanya, tumingin sya sa amin and sabay taas ng kilay. Grabe ang lakas ng loob talaga!!! That time binulungan ako ng bestfriend ko, sabi nya ung girl na un transferee and nagboboard sa boarding house ni ate lhot. Syempre, that time napaisip ako. I said to my self that this girl is different with the other girls I met and I said to my self that I want to meet this girl as soon as possible. That time paalis na yung girl, sabi ko sa sarili ko mga 30 minutes pa susundan ko sya. Nang nasa boarding house na nya ko, ang palabas ko eh naghahanap ang cousin ko ng boarding house nakausap ko yung landlady (ate lhot) nila then I ask her about the tall girl I saw. Awa naman ng diyos pinakilala nya ako sa girl. Nicky ang name nya, 18 yrs old. Kabado nga ako that time habang kausap si nicky and I donât even know why? I try my best para maging interesting ang conversation naming dalawa pero that time it didnât work. Hawak-hawak ba naman ang cellphone and ni hindi man lang ako makuhang tignan mas gusto pa atang magtext kesa makipag-usap sa akin. Pero grabe talaga ang tama ko sa kanya pakiramdam ko nga inlove na ko that time sa kanya eh. After that day I decide na ligawan sya, after a couple of weeks awa naman ng diyos sinagot nya koh, that very moment pakiramdam ko am the luckiest guy in the world.  As the day pass lalo akong na-iinlove sa kanya because of her personality because sheâs very charming, sweet, cool and very interesting ang character nya. Masarap syang kasama i never had a single moment na nabored ako sa kanya siguro isang explanation doon ay ang pagiging pareho namin ng personality para kasi syang girl version koh. Pareho kami ng hobbies and ng trip. Sa lahat ng naging girlfriend ko sa kanya ko lang naramdaman ang ganon na pakiramdam. Ang dami naming mga memories na masasabi kung may kakaibang spark. Para bang laging may bago sa relationship namin kaya hindi nakakasawa (gets nyo ba ibig kung sabihin?) Basta yon na un ang hirap kasi i-explain eh. Iâm so happy that time until one night when I visit her in her boarding house nakita ko syang umiiyak and hindi lang sya basta umiiyak, she was sobbing hard until she notice my present tumayo sya sa kinauupuan nya and she hug me crying badly. The only question in my mind that time is, why is she crying??? Ako ba ang rason ng pag-iyak nya??? That very moment I feel so bad at that moment and pakiramdam ko lahat ng lakas ko sa katawan ay nawala, yakap-yakap ko ang babaeng pinakamamahal ko and I donât know what to do to make her feel better. Nasasaktan ako na nakikita ko syang umiiyak *did anyone of you fell this kind of pain*. Yakap-yakap ko sya while whispering in her ears not to cry because I feel lost when she do that then she stop and look in my eyes with tears in her eyes and said im sorry because pinag worry kita that badly, I promise I will never do that again. After she said that I hug her and told her how much I love her and cherish her. I asked her why sheâs crying that hard, but she didnât tell me. The next day nalaman ko na lang sa landlady nila na ninakaw ung hamster (Russian dwarf hamster) na binigay ko kay nicky and that night hindi alam ni nicky kung paano nya i-explain na nawala ang hamster na binigay ko sa kanya and sheâs so worried na baka magalit ako sa kanya thatâs why sheâs crying. At that moment lalo kung na prove sa sarili ko na this girl is really different and that moment I realize how much I love her, sheâs the only person na nagbigay ng halaga sa akin *you want to ask why?* because I told her that hamster is represent me as her special love one and that she need to take care of that hamster the way she take care of me.  Well, our relationship went smooth as I expected dahil sabi ko nga pareho kami ng hilig simula sa pc games hanggang sa kind ng music na pinapakinggan namin. Pero siguro talagang may relationship na dumadaan sa mga trials na nagiging dahilan upang hindi magwork ang isang relationship. Of course nangyari na rin sa relationship namin ni Nicky ang bagay na yan. 3rd week ng July 2003 when Nicky and Ritchie (one of my bestfriends) decided to go to my house in Caloocan to surprise me. That time naman on the way na ko sa Boarding House nya to pick her up. They went in my place and ang nadatnan nila ay ang mommy ko. Let me first tell you guys something about my mom. My mom doesnât like Nicky as my girlfriend because sheâs a pure Filipino, gusto kasi nya Chinese or kahit half Chinese man lang. But nicky doesnât know that my mom doesnât like her, ang alam nya gusto sya ng mom ko as my girlfriend. Hindi ko kasi sinabi sa kanya na ayaw sa kanya ng mom ko coz I know sheâs gonna be really upset. I donât know what really happened in my place all I know is my mom told Nicky that she doesnât like her and she want her to get out in my life. Pero Ritchie told me na hindi lang yon ang sinabi ng mom ko kay Nicky may mga masasakit din na salita na sinabi sa kanya. That time naman nasa labas ako ng boarding nila Nicky waiting for her, around 7:00pm ng umulan medyo nag-aalala na ko sa kanya dahil hindi pa rin sya dumadating I didnât notice na dumating na pala sya sheâs standing back at me kasi. That time naramdaman ko na may problema sya, I ask her whatâs wrong??? She look me in the eyes and told me about what happened in my place. That moment alam ko na masamang-masama ang loob nya and I know that she wants to cry pero pinipigil nya. Gusto kong yakapin sya and tell her that itâs okey to cry, na okey lang na ilabas nya ang sama ng loob nya coz Iâm here to listin pero hindi ko magawa. Pakiramdam ko kasi noon eh galit sya sakin dahil hindi ko sinabi sa kanya yung tungkol sa mom ko. She then told me that we have to talk about our relationship. Mahal na mahal daw nya ko but tama daw ang sinabi ng mom ko about me that our relationship will never work. Sabi nya kailangan nya muna ng space dahil magulo ang isip nya. That moment I want to shout, to cry, tell her that we donât need to do that pero i have no guts to tell that kind of words to her. Pakiramdam ko that moment nag stop ang mundo ko. She said that we need to have a space between us, wala akong masabi that time sa kanya ni hindi ako umiimik that moment. Then a couple of minutes pass she hug me and walk away from me. I called her name but she didnât look back, I know sheâs crying that moment and I know she didnât want me to see her like that. Nakatayo lang ako habang pinagmamasdan palayo ang babaeng pinakamamahal ko, naramdaman ko na lang na umiiyak na ko (napansin nya kaya yon?). Itâs almost 1 hour when I decided to leave that place, tinawagan ko si Ritchie at sinabi ko yung nangyari sa amin ni Nicky. I want to get drunk that time kaya inaya ko na rin ang barkada na umiinom. I decided to go to her place again, to talk to her and convince her pero sinabihan ako ni Ritchie na na ipagpabukas ko na lang ang pagpunta kina Nicky dahil nakainom na ako at para magkaroon si Nicky ng time na makapag-isip. Well, I decided to go the following day pero hindi ako nakapunta dahil may pinaasikaso ang mom ko na papeles na kailangan sa business namin. I called Nicky on her cellphone that day pero naka-off. Tinext ko pa rin sya kahit alam kong naka-off ang cellphone nya and told her na pupunta ako kina-umagahan para makapag-usap kami, I know naman that time na wala akong matatanggap ng respond mula sa kanya pero still pursigido ako na makausap sya ng personal (gusto ko kasi talagang ayusin ang relationship naming dalawa.)   *TO BE CONTINUE*
