      Iâm posting again, seems that everybody is still sleeping, so I had to get y self busy with somethingâ¦. I was cleaning my room yesterday and I found this gig wonderful Flag!! Itâs a Colombian Flag YEAH!!, I put it on the wall, when the cooler fan Itâs on it stars moving really cool, heheâ¦ I love it!! I have to get all of u guys to come and sign it, I would like to have some kind of memory before I die, in three months, There is no cure, Iâm sorryâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. HEHEHE got all of ya!!!!?? Did I?? Oh well I donât think soâ¦. It was a bad one â¦ hehe Iâm kind of tired Today, anyway, I was cleaning and I was getting bored like crap, so I decided to call Christa, (Itâs really fun talking with her, itâs like u forget about ur problems when she is there, hhehe,) so we talked for a little bit about school, life, asking questions and getting to know a Little bit more of each other, it was really fun that girl is AWESOME!!, I wish I couldâ¦ Oh well, I talked with her online last night, and somehow donât remember how we got to the point of me telling her a story (This is not usual from meâ¦â¦â¦.. The reality is that in my stories people always die and with sad endingsâ¦ hehe sorry, I think is just a way to change the subject or something, sorry,, hehe) returning â¦â¦â¦ Oh wait I do rememberâ¦â¦â¦â¦ ok anyways. I started telling her a story about two characters having some kind of conflict, they both liked each other, â¦â¦â¦â¦. Wait a sec brb heheheheâ¦. Hope I willâ¦..Sister needs my helpâ¦â¦â¦. â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. ok Iâm back it was for about 15min, I think u canât tell the difference, hehehâ¦â¦.. A crap the phoneâ¦â¦â¦.brbâ¦â¦â¦UHUHUHUHUHU!, remember the phone call, It was an old friend who use to live in Colombia but now lives in â¦â¦â¦.. donât remember somewhere around this country, heeh sorry,  She has two sons, they are friends of mine, they are really cool, And guess what they are coming!!! Yeah!!!, we use to hang out in the Church, I havenât seen them since forever, they should be all grown up, oh well This story got Really way off the course sorryâ¦ herhe Where were we?? Mmmm O yeah, This two characters have been talking for a while, getting to know each other, they have lots of things in commonâ¦ Itâs just a special connection, U could tell if u see them walking on the road u would probably say that they are something else,  The guy does nothing but thinks and dreams about her, he is reallyâ¦â¦.. falling..â¦. Hoping and daring to expect something could be possible,  The only think that he hasnât done is probablyâ¦.. ask her out and start a new life â¦.. In her company,  There is a problemâ¦â¦. Ahhhhhh phone againâ¦. Brbâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ okâ¦â¦â¦.sorry guysâ¦â¦â¦â¦. This not the right time for them, He knows they must wait and ask for divine direction,  â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. To be continuedâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ The story Will be finished one of these daysâ¦â¦.. Lets give time to the timeâ¦ This had been funâ¦â¦ Iâm getting this about writingâ¦â¦.. I thinkâ¦â¦. Luv u all, talk to ya later  PD (I donât think Iâll be online today)

      Hey guys!! Itâs early in the morning and I feel like posting something, hehe,.. Jesse, came yesterday to my house in the afternoon and we spend like an hour together, It was a really good time,   He has an awesome gift given by GOD, is just amazing how easily he develop songs, and write them, hehe, He showed me some new tips for the guitar (Iâm so excited!!),  Today is Tuesday and I still have some days before I go to summer school âFun stuffâ, I guess.. I talked with Jody and Kristy, and they say is really horrible, u only have like 2 breaks of 10min, and its really HOT!!, oh wellâ¦ I have to do it anyways,  Iâm really excited with the recent news !!! Michael is MOVING!! YEAH!!, UHUHUH!. this is going to be funâ¦. Canât wait for that to happenâ¦ Next week Heâll be in EAGLE ROCK, Hope He has a really good time, I wonât be able to see him until like 2 weeksâ¦. Uhuh this is sadâ¦ I have to find something to do on those daysâ¦â¦. Great News!!  I have been praying to God about â¦â¦.. my life, future, My purpose here on this earth,â¦.  He Has Spoken!!, Iâm so Happy!!... Finally now I know where and what to doâ¦.  I have been kind of lazy on the last days concerning about my Music, I need to be more constant with it, I got some new books and Iâm going to dedicate to read them and learn from them My left knee started to hurt againâ¦.. Yesterday I had an âaccidentâ riding my bike, â¦.. Iâm not death as u probably see, sorry I killed ur expectations, hehehe, And about my knee, I used to play basketball, we were at this important game, It was almost over and the teamâs scores were tied, we didnât want to go in overtime, soâ¦ the Coach created a special play, It was kinda of complex, But something went wrong at the moment we were doing this movements, we loosed the ball, but no one of the teams had it, it was going towards the side line, so I ran really fast and catch it, but the laws of gravity and velocity were not on my side that day, I gave the ball to one of my teammates, but It was to late for me, I sliced and cuze I went fast the only thing that stopped me was a wall, My left knee was dislocated, and I had an incapacity for about 4 months, but GOOD news A least we won the Game!! Hehe,  So itâs bothering me for this days, Iâm trying to make some exercises to get better, I was supposed to finish a story, but I think it should be more fun If  I finish when Christa goes online again..  Ok guys talk to ya later

      Its early in the morning, I just had breakfast, I though I could post something before I go to sleepâ¦â¦â¦. And yes AGAIN??.. Letâs say that I didnât have a peaceful night after I talked with Christa and Ashley, heheh. Itâs a long story that I think I donât have to recount again.â¦â¦.. I  have been praying and asking GOD for direction, and I think we both agree with the same decision.  For all of us (Christa, Ashley, and me), when we are all together, itâs now so different, Itâs like we all get kind ofâ¦â¦ weird â¦..  I donât want that, that makes me so sadâ¦.. we all made a mistake, somehow, It was just aâ¦â¦â¦â¦pooooff, everything came out and now we are stuck.  The right thing to doâ¦â¦. Is just â¦â¦â¦â¦ lets all be friends, lets forget about what happened, and start over again. Christa and Ashley we all r really good friends and I donât want to loose any of youâ¦â¦â¦  I think that is a good end for this story, and the beginning of a new one, hehe I still want to talk with u Christa and Ashley in person, so we clarify any other questions or doubts u guys may have. This is a decision led by GOD and I know is the right thing to doâ¦. I have to go for now. Bed is calling me againâ¦â¦â¦  Cya all later bye

      Hey!! Guys I finally decided to write something on this......... And I think first of all I should introduce myself to all of you,  My name is Giovanni Andres Bermudez CastaÃ±eda,......... Kind of big I know.... but best known as "Joey", y? ohh well....... Lets say I just got used to it, it is most like a nickname in the fam, and with all my friends. I was born In the City of Cali-Colombia, on November 18 of 1987, as u probaly know, or if u now how to add and count u will figure out that I'm 16, hehe,  I moved here about eight months ago, and it's been a great adventure, I had to leave my whole life behind, Family, Friends, my land, it was really sad, believe me....  However it was God's purpose on my life, I would rather do what he wants than what I want to. I think someday I'll return, but just to visit and probably do what GOD's purpose down there. When I first got here, I was full of expectations and fears, the fact that now was just my fam and me, made it different. I started going to the Church again (FOC), this stands for Faith Outreach Church, I met a lot of people, they all are really nice and friendly. There I met the Monroe's family, our families have o lot in common, Michael Monroe is the older of the kids, hehe, he is the coolest guy I ever met before, He is my Best friend, I love him so much, he is more than a friend, he is more like a brother, I mean he is there when u need him, giving u advice, and making u laugh when u r sad, I couldn't ask something better for me..... thanks God ....... we have a special future together.......  Moving on, Sam and Alesha, forgive me if I misspell ur names, hehe, they are Michael's sisters, about the same age of mine's, My sisters talk a lot about them, even thought they don't talk to much to each other......... u guys know they are still learning English as I am, but they will be soon speaking fluently !!.. I love them to much, they had blessed me in many different ways...... (Random Fact.......Michael's Birthday is one day before mine... hehe.. that is really cool!!)  In (FOC) I had the privilege of been part in the Worship team, I was supposed to play the piano, but I think the circumstances were open for singing, hehe, I love to sing, I still miss a bunch of people in there.......... I LOVE U GUYS!! About a Month ago we decided to start going to other church, (It was GOD's purpose... I still don't get it but I know it was). It's not the same without all the guys, (Michael, Jerry, Jay, Amy, Lisa, Debbie, Victoria, Kristy ohh men it's a long list). (ECBC) stands for East Coast Believers Church, the new Church's name, There I met a lot of new people, specially this two persons, Christa and Ashley. They are really cool, I'm getting to know them, and it's been really fun. We all have tried to hang out together, including Michael, but its been impossible, hehe, hopefully we will. Oh well I'm going to leave u guys by now, This thing about writting in english is kinda hard.........for me........ please forgive me and don't blame if I have wrong words and things that don't make sense........sorry, I'm practicing using this.....  heh cya all later
