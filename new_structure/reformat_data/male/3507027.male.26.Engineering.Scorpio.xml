      I suffer from a panic disorder, which can lead to some weird things to come out of my head, most of them, unfortunately, are R-rated.  I can have a vicious mouth on me, that can lead to some crazy put-downs.  For example...   August 27, 2003   I think my medicine kicks in at the wrong time.  By 3:00, it is in full steam and Iâm a damn goof ball, some think Iâm a flake.  I wish it would kick in like at 8:00 in the morning.  Maybe it would, if I took it at 3:00 a.m.  Shit, I can barely wake up at 7:00, who am I fooling.  Janice, my little bitch stalker, called last night three times.  Dared to leave a voice mail on my phone.  Claims she âlost the glowâ in serving.  Fuck, I didnât know there was a glow in serving.  WTF?  14 in a 35 year oldâs body, sheâs big trouble.  Fr. Jack knows about the voice mail now.  Sue thinks I should involve her parents.  I do too, either that or I fuckinâ change my phone number.  Clark thinks I should have her arrested for harassment.  Not a bad ideaâ¦  Work wasnât too bad today.  Bob was a total airheadâ¦as usual.  Mighty Mind wasnât talking much today, thank Christ.  If he did, I would have to bitch at him.  Rachel thought I was nuts to cross Telegraph to deliver a set of plans to Aquila.  Told her Iâve done it before.  When is Barry going to talk to me about my review?  I guess I should continue to avoid him, for now.  Still pissed over the fact he called Clark in on Friday to discuss me with him.  What a pussy!  Talk to ME about me, damnit.  If you have something to say, say it, donât be a pussy about it.  Only makes me not respect you any more than I did already, you micro-managing prick.  Clark made his usual smart-ass comment to me rather early this morning about my shirt being wrinkled.  Fuck you!  Tomorrow I come in naked.  See whatâs wrinkled on me now, asshole!  I need to find a job or something, because I am going crazy.  Is it wrong for a man to cry at work?  I sat at my desk, pondering different things, when I felt my eyes water up.  I was thinking, âWhat the hell, man?  Pull yourself together.â  I canât vent at work, because everyone would think Iâm absolutely crazyâ¦or more than what I am already.  Maybe I need to change my personality.  I canât figure it out.  Maybe I need to see a shrink.  Maybe Iâm psycho and just donât know it yet?  No one understands and Iâve already complained, bitched, pissed, and moaned to the usual people.  I think they are starting to get tired of me complaining to them all the time.  Oh, great, the last line I just typed has me crying again.  You big pussy!  I thought the fuckinâ medicine was supposed to stop this.  My emotions swing too damn much for my liking.  This is crazy.   Why all of a sudden do I feel this need to type my thoughts out?  Maybe Iâm trying to self-diagnose something, like a mental problem?!  Maybe because no one cares to listen to me explain this either online or in-person?  I probably will not figure it out until it hits me in the head like a fuckinâ crescent wrench being dropped from a 10-story building. Love stinks!  Itâs that simple.    Why does everyone think Iâm gay?  Is it because I slur my sâs?  Is it because the last time I had a major crush on someone is like on the twelfth of never?  Now, I refuse to bash gays.  That is not my right.  I didnât earn the right to bash them because Iâm a Catholic, or because I see their lifestyle as âoddâ, but this for certain, I AM NOT GAY!  FUCK YOU, YOU COCKSUCKER (and you know who you are).  Yeah, I slur my sâs, think I can fuckinâ help that?  No, I canât.  Get over it!  Fuck you and everyone that looks like you, you spineless pussy.  I canât instantly get a new voice, so get used to it, you asshole in a HAT!  And, yeah, maybe I should look for a girlfriend, but you know what?  Everytime I get one, stupid shit happens.  They either move, or pull stupid shit and not talk to you for long periods of time, or they decide that youâre such a geek and refuse to even acknowledge you.  Maybe Iâm too picky and need to settle down.  But, you know what?  Maybe my standards are set too high for a reason.  I DONâT WANT A LETDOWN AGAIN, DAMNIT!  I couldnât handle it.  Iâm too emotionally strained at this time to carry the burden of getting a girlfriend and risking the chance of losing her.  My self-esteem is terrible.  I have little faith in myself anymore.  Iâve had too many letdowns in such a small time but I wouldnât know how to take another.    September 2, 2003   Bob Behrendt is a fucking prick.  So maybe at times I feel like working in the dark.  Iâve had a headache every day for the last three days.  To avoid another one is either turn out the lights and turn on my lamp or shut my door and not listen to you, asshole.  Well, today it was turn out the lights, the partyâs over.  He comes into my office and says, âWhat is this, mood lighting?â  Oh, yeah, Bob, sitting in the dark really gets me in the mood.  Donât ask me what mood, maybe anger if you donât leave my office in two fucking seconds.  Then I go up to Rachel and tell her what happened.  She tells me not to take everything Bob says literally.  I tell her that I do consider the source but stillâ¦the man is a joke of an engineer and a person.  Heâs a moron who hasnât EVER earned my respect.  Heâs a pansy, his wife runs his life, heâs pussy-whipped, and it shows!  Then he attempts conversation with me.  What a joke!  Every conversation ends with me getting pissed off and with my feelings hurt.  WHY DO I PUT UP WITH THIS?!?!  Document everything.  Iâve been told by various people at Kroger is to document everything that happens at that place.  Letâs see, hereâs my documentationâ¦ 1.	Shirt is wrinkled â The egging-on comment: âWhat happened, iron burn out?â  Response: Frustration and a door slam. 2.	Three earrings - The egging-on comment: âFairy boy!â  Response: Frustration and a door slam, followed by gnashing of teeth. 3.	Lights out in my office - The egging-on comment: âMood lighting?â  Response: No, the glare is bothering me.  Continued egging: âTake a nap like you usually do with the door shut?â  Response: âI DONâT TAKE NAPS!â  Frustration and a door slam. 4.	Door is shut - The egging-on comment: âTaking a nap?â  Response: âI DONâT TAKE NAPS!  Iâm actually trying to concentrate, but you people are making too much noise.  How about moving my office?â  Comment: âHA HA!â  Frustration and a door slam.   5.	Me snacking on potato chips (or something else): The egging-on comment: âBreakfast of champions?â or âYou eating your lunch?â Response: âI snack so I can leave at 4:00 while the rest of you take your lunch at noon or so.  I can manage to work straight through.â  Their response: â¦can you hear the crickets chirping.  I shut them up for once! So, you see, this is the bullshit I have to put up with on a daily basis.  I do nothing right there at all.  If I do, people are shocked and amazed.  I am underestimated in my abilities and it shows around there.  Excuse me, the diploma on my wall isnât from fuckinâ Cracker Jack University.  Yeah, itâs from Owens, but still, I worked my ass off for that piece of framed paper on my wall.  FUCK YOU ALL!  Hey, MSG, wonder why everyone is leaving?  How about putting a sign on the front door:  âCheck your attitudes here!â  I have maybe two friends there anymore.  All the people I liked there have left.  After Shawn Medley left in January, I basically said, I have no reason to stay here anymore.  Now, 9 months later, Iâm still there and am not enjoying it one bit.  Arenât you supposed to like your job, not dread going to it every day?  Check your attitude at the door because I donât want to hear it.  Makes me respect you less because you cant do your job without an ego.  Check your attitude and ego at the door.  I thought they taught you that in school.  Guess not!  Till again, God Bless.  Well, I guess that is a look inside the mind of someone suffering from a panic disorder.  Here is something I wrote when I was feeling rather, well, confused.  It describes me to a T.  With that, I leave you for today.   Depression is something that does not go away.  It comes from different sources, some real, some caused by stress, some caused by the fact that you are the way you are.  No matter what medicine you take, no matter who you gather with, the depression lasts and lasts.  Welcome to my world, a world of shyness, sorrow, and deep down pain.  If I annoy you, I annoy you in kindness and desperation.  This is my way of reaching out.  Please, reach back.  I need it, now more than ever.  Keep me in your prayers when you kneel down at night.  I need them.  I feel them.  I desire them.  They may be my only hope...

      What do I believe in?  What do I stand for?  I am a Catholic living in a time of extreme strife in my Church.  I believe that the youth of the Catholic Church need to step up RIGHT NOW and stand for their beliefs, or our Church will die.  I believe other priests and ministers have done the same things Catholic priests have done...and have done even more harsh things.  I believe that the Catholic Church is undergoing a witch hunt and that the media wishes to have scarlet letters on all of our backs when we go to church.  I believe in the freedom of speech...to a point.  I don't want your point of view crammed down my throat.  I am open to listening to your point-of-view...but I also believe in ignoring your point-of-view if I wish to.  Because, more than likely, your point-of-view sucks.  Oh, and by the way, don't try to influence me with the things YOU want to do or want ME to do.  I'm stubborn and have seen a lot.  I'm set in my ways and I hate yours.  So there.  I can make my own decisions.  And, more than likely, I'm not going to want to do your stuff.  Get over it.  Let it go.  I believe that it is only a matter of time before the music we hear will control our bodies, if it hasn't happened already.  If we listen to a positive, up-beat sound, we will become positive and up-beat.  I believe rap music will be the death of us all.  Someone will become influenced by the lyrics and will go on a maniacial spree and kill us all.  Yeah, maybe it's far-fetched, but in this crazy world of ours, who knows.  I believe that the "goth" movement is a ridiculous joke.  What is with all the black garb lately?  GROW UP!  The ONLY reason someone should be dressed in all black is if you are morning a loved one.  Ever hear of white?  I believe in prayer in schools.  God may not be able to fix all that is wrong in our schools and in our society, but maybe it's worth a shot.  It couldn't hurt.  These are my beliefs, open to addition when I think of more.  If these are yours, wonderful.  If they aren't, good for you.
