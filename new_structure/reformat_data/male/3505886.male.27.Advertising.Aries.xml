Him and some others have totally been engrossed in that fictional world for more than 2 yearsâ¦.the latest victim being another dear friend who has been doing nothing but âxpâingâ for the last couple of months. And nowâ¦..uberness prevailsâ¦..  What is it all about, I mean WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT?!!...u suddenly find urself as  part of another world. A world with âotherâ friends, where you go about roaming the landscape killing whatever stands in your way, moving from one âzoneâ to another, searching for items which wud make your âcharacterâ more powerful, grouping up with other players to kill more stronger enemies to gain more l337 l00t, giving you more abilities, more experience â¦.interesting aint it?  ...ahem!...   âsorry broâ¦cant cya tnightâ¦gotta attend a xegony raidâ¦yeaâ¦.kâ¦.byeâ¦.â WTF!? ânah manâ¦.cant go to the gymâ¦im in the middle of getting my epicâ WTF!?x2 ânot in the mood to go outâ¦have to spend time with the family, â¦plus gotta kill this mob â¦uber dropsâ â¦.. o_Oâ¦.kâ¦nevermind thenâ¦.  and then there was one late night callâ¦âoye yaarâ¦guess what item I picked up..check this out â 18/20 double hander, +50 to all stats, sv- 40, 100 mana, 100 hp, right click heal instant cast, quad procâ â¦.I donât know what I wrote hereâ¦but it sounded something like it!.....  never ending discussions of what one did at a particular moment in the game, how one used the abilities to overcome a really difficult situationâ¦.gives one a sense of satisfaction â¦definitelyâ¦but that is all u getâ¦â¦.constant bickering abt mistakes made in the game, â¦.âu cant kill a mob if it were snared, slowed, ddâed, rooted, poisoned and down to 10% hps, â¦u suck at this gameâ â¦or maybe even âbroâ¦I diedâ¦my corpse is in a weird placeâ¦no one willing to gimme rezâ¦.do something la!!!â....blah blah blah blahâ¦..  â¦..sighâ¦.the bastards at verant (game developer) and soe (sony online entertainment) â¦.destroying innocent livesâ¦ermmâ¦.well not innocentâ¦.kindly ignore that!....  hard to understand in the beginning, but it all makes sense when u hear about all this for more than 2 yearsâ¦I guess its my turn nowâ¦to see what really makes em tick!...i bid thee farewell â¦â¦for nowâ¦  I have to go xpâ¦.plus need to buy this really uber bpâ¦.damn â¦.im running short of cashâ¦.  /shouts â¦..wtf bro?â¦.i need some ppsâ¦.
