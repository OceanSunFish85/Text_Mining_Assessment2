      Let's just say I can honestly say I can understand why there are wife beaters out there now. My future ex wife is the biggest Psycho Stalker I know. First of all I'm giving up allot to the bitch and willingly too and it's still not enough. Remember the party I went to with a friend and then went to breakfast the next day with this friend? Well according to my current Bitch future ex, I'm automatically sleeping with this friend. I was seen at the restaurant by my current bitch future ex's last boss and she went and told the bitch I was at breakfast with a chick.So now I'm confronted with the question of "who did you go to breakfast with". Now I know she knows something at that point and I know nothing happened so I proceeded to spill the beans and be truthfull and honest about the whole situation. Well that wasn't a good idea either. I was screwed no matter what I said. So the bitch proceeds to reem me a new ass hole and calls me a peice of shit and hangs up on me. Yeup she hung up on me. Now I'm not really a big fan of the C word when it comes to actually calling a girl that but the bitch was being a CUNT! Sorry ladies for using that word but seriously, I think I deserved that privaledge. So anyway, that all happened on Monday with her hanging up on me and stuff. I haven't even commented on Sunday. But I'm not done with Monday and Tuesday yet. So after she hung up on me I gota little worried about what she is going to do next. She called me back and proceeded to accuse me of doing things that I didn't do and continue to put me down and call me names. So that was Monday.   Tuesday comes along and she calls me up and tells me not to get all pissed off and scared and worried. Ok, I don't know about you but when someone says that, what's the first thing you do? You start to worry and get scared and try to figure out why you'd get pissed off. Am I right? Of course I am. So she proceeds to tell me that she contacted a lawyer. I'm shit'n bricks at this point. Then she tells me that the lawyer thinks I'm being very reasonable and very cooperative with everything. That's coming from the enemy which made me feel a little easier............until this morning.   So this morning she called me first thing and implied that she was contesting the divorce and what would I do if she did. Once again bricks are coming out of my ass. Lawyers were mentioned and she made the comment of "You'll be fucked if you get a lawyer". Now the bricks are turning into cement blocks, you know the big cement block with the two holes in the middle. So any way, I know exactly how to handle that so I'm just trying to be nice and work the friend thing at this point. I don't know what else to do.   As for Sunday, it got a little ugly on the phone with her. I had already had a bad day by getting up to the counter after shopping, and had a pile of clothes and a line behind me. I wrote a check and gave it to the clerk. She proceeded to punch in the numbers and put the check through then tells me they can't accept it. This is after I just wrote a check in the shoe department of the same store. WTF!! I still don't know why but I ended up holding up the line for about 20 mins and walked away with none of clothes that I brought up to the counter.   So when I got home after the shopping experience the phone starts ringing. I ignored it cause it was the bitch. Well it didn't stop ringing for over an hour. So I called her back and chewed her a new ass hole. I called her a psycho stalker and a bitch and I think I might have mentioned a restraining order. I don't really remember, I had some alcohol in me at the time. All I know is that she really pissed me off and I wanted to beat her. So you might want to say that I'm a "Wanna Be Wife Beater". I wish I could remember all the details of Sunday to end this blog in an interesting fashion, but I'll leave it up to the imagination from what you've all heard about Monday, Tuesday and this morning.   See ya for now and stay tuned for more interesting tails from "The Wanna Be Wife Beater".............................To Be Continued!!

      Well first of all I do need to comment about my Friday night. I went to a party with someone I now consider a friend and we had a good time I think considering......... The party was more of a small get together and the only thing that was great about the whole night was getting to know my new friend, oh yeah and a little bit of interesting drama of 2 girls fighting over my gay friend from high school. He did hook up with one though......good for him, bad for me. He got two I got none.   My new friend passed out on me along with everyone else. So I'm stuck watching Something About Mary by myself with a bunch of passed out people all around me. Then out of the blue there's panic cause one of the girls was having an asthma attack and came running out in her little tiny undies and bra, very nice I must say. Everyone in the room I was in slept righ through it.  So the next morning I wake up, which was actually only 3 hours after I fell asleep, and me and my new friend decide to go to breakfast. But before we leave she needs her shoes, and guess where they are? Near where she fell asleep? Nope. Near where I fell asleep? Nope. Nextto the cool guy who passed out with no pants on in the other room sporting morning wood? Yeup! So then we leave and go have breakfast.   So the rest of my day consisted of moving furniture for my future ex-wife. But I did get a couch out of the deal and I'm psyched about that. I watched the game today on my new couch, with the future ex-wife. She was actually packing her shit. Which brings me the whole meaning of the title of this Blog Post. She took my Cats away!! I didn't think I would be as bummed as I was, but I was really bummed. They were all meowing and crying as they were leaving which didn't make me to happy about parting with them. But what got me by was that fact that they've been pissing on any pile of clothing that I've left around anywhere all friggin month. So I have to wash a shit load of clothes now and the piss smell isn't easy to get out. Yup, I'm sooooooo over my cats already.   Stay tuned........................... to be continued!

      So my fucking Douche Bag of a future ex wife was supposed to come home last night to finish packing her shit so I can pack up her brand new fucking Mini SUV that I helped her get into by providing her with my life savings, But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO course not. She ended up acting like the old bitch that she is by going to Bingo at the last minute and leaving me hanging for the evening after canceling or turning down any plans that I may have been asked to do. Word to the wise Gentlemen, DON'T GET MARRIED!! My top ten reasons fornot getting marriedguys:    10.BINGO!  9. When you get married you lose all rights to the remote.  8. The nagging gets worse.  7. Every sentence out of her mouth starts with "Can you" or "Will you".  6.You lose half of everything.  5. Your house becomes a Martha Stewart factory.  4. You have to visit with her parents on a regular bases.  3. You don't get laid on a regular bases.  2. You are stuck having sex with the same woman for ever.  1. NO MORE BLOW JOBS!!    These may not be the most amusing reasons for someone to read but their mine. I'll have a more amusing list when I'm not so pissed at my future ex douche bag.    Stay tuned to more breaking news about the "BIG D". This is only the Beginning.

      My married life has come to an end.  My wife and I are getting the long awaited divorce.  We're still in the beginning stages of the war and so far she's winning, cleaning me out of just about everything I own.  But I'm keeping the house, just losing everything in it.  I'm going to try this divorce kit that I found online and see if it works.  You never know though, I'm a little worried about trying something that was just randomly found on some website on the net.  But what the HELL!  Well that's my news for today, if anyone knows anything about divorces and knows how to keep me from getting anal raped, please feel free to help a fella out.  Hasta Pasta!!
