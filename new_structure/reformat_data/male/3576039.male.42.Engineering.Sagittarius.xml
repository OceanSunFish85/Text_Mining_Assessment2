      I happened to be talking to a mutual friend of mine and Annahâs and he commented that she told him I had called her some weeks ago.  He described her as being very angry about it (which I know she was) but for a girl that wants to keep her husband in the dark about some things that she does, it seems like she wouldnât go telling people that someone she has met online is calling her.  Unless of course her intent is make me out to be some kind of stalker and get me in trouble.  I hope that isnât the case.  I wish she would just have one civil conversation with me so that I can understand what the hell I am supposed to do.  I just canât forget herâ¦why would I do that since she is the only real friend that I have ever had?  That isnât a delusion, it is the sad reality.  I guess if she said she didnât want to be my friend, and could tell me why, I would get it.  But that isnât what she doesâ¦she has said we canât be friendsâ¦but not why we canât and I donât really believe in âcanâtâ anyways.  I think it is that she doesnât want to be friends anymore.  Iâm not trying hard to avoid her like I wasâ¦like she wanted.  I am trying to run into her online any chance I get.  What?  Did someone call that stalking?  Iâm sorry, I donât think so.  You canât stalk someone that you canât find.    I have said it to her so many timesâ¦I just want to talk to her and understand what the hell happened.  She has totally shut me out and I get nothing. Nothing.  And it beats on my head constantly that I have done something wrong and I want to make it right.  But I donât know what that is.  And I canât talk to anyone about it.  Yeah, I would like to make it rightâ¦and have a friend again.  Anybody have any ideas?

      OKâ¦Iâm back!  I took my wife up on her âofferâ to take a vacation by myself and ended up in Chile.  Patagonia is *!cold!* this time of year but it was a nice time.  I spent a lot of time doing two thingsâ¦riding around the mountains by myself (well, semi- by myselfâ¦the guide wouldnât let me get out of his sight, but I guess that is what I paid him for) and sitting by this huge fireplace drinking Pisco Sours by the pitcher and staring at the mountains.  Yes, that means I took up drinking again, at least for a few daysâ¦it seemed to be worthwhile.  I kind of liked the Pisco when I first started, but I am sick of it by now.  I donât know how the Chileans can stand to drink that crap day in and day out.  And you may ask â Roto, what did you do with all of this idle time?  That is easy to answer â I thought about Annah.  I thought about the how and the why of our relationship.  I expect if one was to ask her, there is no relationship to even think about â so why do I feel differently.  I went through all the psychology of itâ¦Iâm quite capable of thatâ¦and decided that I fell in love with her simply because of who she is.  And I am not able to just fall out of love because she wants me to.  Maybe I donât have a real objective opinion of the situation.  In any case, I am resigned to just think about her and not do anything about it.  I think of calling her every morning, but I promised her that I would never do that again.  I will try to hold to that.  On a separate note, I had a conversation with my wife when I got home.  She was in a pretty good moodâ¦must have been caused by my absenceâ¦and we talked about our marriage a bit.  She said a few things that I didnât understand and so I just ask her flat outâ¦âYou really donât like me do you?â  Her response, without hesitating, was âNo, I really donât like you at all anymore.â  You know, if I was like a total jerk, I could understand that.  But I am not a jerk [which might be disputable since I have this girlfriend thing going while I am married, you need to read more to understand].  I do anything and everything that a good loving husband is expected to do.  I might even do more, at least compared to all the men that I know.  Maybe she has just learned to not like me because of our history and has chosen to not expose herself to any potential crap from me, if should ever fail again.  I donât know.  Well, enough of this.  It is the weekendâ¦I will go see what it holds in store for the broken man.

      A bad day that is getting worse.  Another day lacking any accomplishment.  Well, maybe a bit.  The weekend passed quickly but not painlesslyâ¦ignored by my wife even though I tried to do everything right.  Funny, I was only called an asshole once this weekend.  She really is a nice girl.  I thought about Annah too much.  Wondering if I will ever hear from her again, how long can I go waiting to hear from her before I fuck up and call her.  Itâs been a week or more, or at least it seems that way.  Packing up my bag for a trip.  I have to be in San Francisco tomorrow for some bullshit interface with the board of directors.  Canât they understand I am too busy to put up with their bullshit?  Fly all the way across the continent just to answer some bullshit questions for a bunch of old men that only care about money.  What about caring about me?  My wife says that she has no time for a vacation this summer and I should go on my own.  So that is what the morning was spent doingâ¦planning.  I decided to go to Torres del Paine in Chile.  I have never been that far south in Chile before and always wanted to go.  Just some fishing and hiking by my lonesome ass self.  Maybe I will come back a changed man.  Well, if I am gone from here beyond the end of the week, it is because I decided to go ahead and take my vacation now.  I will be at the Hotel Salto Chico if anybody gives a shit.  Look for the guy that travels alone.

      I was thinking about taking up drinking again.  I used to drink pretty hardâ¦growing up, through college, into my 30âs I guess.  I stayed drunk a lot, but it was just for fun.  It took a very minor toll on my marriage because I didnât drink at home, just came home drunk occasionally.  I pretty much stayed drunk while I was traveling which was most of the time back then.  I was one of those guys that drank his whiskey from the bottle and never had a hangover the next morning.  I quit years ago, it has been so long I canât even recall...maybe 12-13 years?  It doesnât seem that long ago but I suppose it was.  I woke up one morning after a 2-3 day binge and didnât really recall what had happened, which most of the time suited me fine.  One eye was swollen shut, a couple of scratches on my face, bruises on my body.  My knuckles were skinned up pretty bad and I thoughtâ¦a typical night.  I used to really enjoy bar fights, they just seemed like such a release of pent up energyâ¦not frustration, more like a good workout.  Nobody was out to kill anybody, just a little smack down.  Nothing like âfight clubâ or anything cool like that, just a little head banging.  That morning though, I hurt worse than usual and thoughtâ¦Iâm getting too old for this shit.  As I lay in bed, I thought about how I enjoyed the clarity of a sober mind versus the haze of the drunken mind.  And I stopped drinking that day.  It wasnât difficult because I wasnât an alcoholic, I just liked to drink.  I never looked backâ¦  Until now.  As I lay in a cold bed this morning, I thought how nice it would be to wake up and not feel the pain of being unloved.  It would be so much nicer to wake up with someone that loved me, or even the knowledge that somewhere there was a lady thinking about me too, but I have almost given up hope of that.  But I wonât start drinking again, I know that.  Not that it scares me or anything, but I still love the clarity of my sober mind.  My mind overwhelms me sometimes and I am amazed at the complexity of the thought process.  Not on some analytical level, Iâm much too lazy for that.  It is just the fact that my mind works at all that sometimes surprises me.

      I can't bring myself to go home.  Everyone has left the office, to go home to their normal houses in their normal neighborhoods and their normal kids and their normal marriage.  Tonight, there is nothing at my house.  Kids are gone off to various places for the summer, the wife is working until 8 or 9.  I have to cook my own dinner, get hollered at for making a mess, hardly seems worth it.  I have a lot of things that need to get done but I know I will just end up on the couch or in front of the computer.  In the end, every day sucks just as bad as the day before.  Hmm..I'm starting to sound a bit depressed.  That really isn't the case so I suppose I should change the tone.  Let me figure out my attitude and maybe and I will be back...  btw, both my wife and Annah have told me I should be medicated.  Women...what do they know about emotions.

      What a shit day.  I hate when I canât accomplish a single thing.  All I do is sit here and waste timeâ¦sucks!  My secretary took off early so I have to answer the dang phone every time it rings.  Itâs always some idiot that thinks I should be doing something for him.  Assholes.  What do they think this is â some kind of business?  Itâs a wonder that I havenât gone bankrupt yet, the way I work.  Lucky for me that when I do work, clients pay lots for my services and expect not much out of me.  It is nice to have a talent like that.  Just think if I had actually applied myself over these past 20 years instead of being a lazy fuck.  I thought I was going to get rich once I figured out that there was money to be made in the â90s.  Too bad I got started late and wasnât paying enough attention in 1999 to pull my shit out of the market before it too late.  Now I will probably work until I die, which sometimes I hope isnât very fucking far off.  Well, enough of that.  I donât feel any better.  So much for writing out my feelings as a release of my whatever.  Maybe I should find somebody to read this shit so they can say â Hey, Iâm having a shitty day too, then I can feel better about my fucked up situation.  Why do people do this anywayâ¦write down non-sensical shit that makes no sense to anyone but themselves.  I read other blogsâ¦and I think âHey, that dude is fucked upââ¦but then I read my own and think I better watch where I throw my rocksâ¦  Well, unlucky for me, the day doesn't end when I leave this office.  I have to put up with myself until I fall asleep, knowing that I will wake up and be the same asshole tomorrow.

      Iâm pretty sure the purpose of this blog is to console myself since no one else sees this.  What kind of therapy is thatâ¦to talk to yourself?    I was going to talk about Annah for a minute, about who she is and why I feel about her the way that I do.  But instead, I have the urge to tell more about myself.  Having read any of my meandering words, you might wonder what type of man is this.  Is this a guy that wants us to feel sorry for him because his wife wonât forgive him for a past transgression?  A guy that is looking for someone to say that he is right, his wife is wrong and his girlfriend is wrong too?   LOLâ¦  No, that isnât what I am looking for.  Man, I know how wrong I am.  I canât justify what happened 15 years ago and I donât try to.  I do try to justify where I am today and can make an argument that suits me, even if it suits no one else.  Blinders, anyone?  I might say that I am just a typical man, but that is much too broad of a stroke.  There are some typical aspects I guess, but there is much more to me than that.  To try and describe myself, who I am, would appear to be quite immodest.  I can say thisâ¦at 43 years old, I havenât aged nicely.  All of the toned muscle is gone, the six-pack has become a pony keg and the stylish hair that I primped every morning has disappeared (well, not completelyâ¦relocated may be a better word for it).  Many women call me handsome, some call me other things, Iâm sure.  Annah actually said that she wasnât physically attracted to me, which I guess is helpful.  But it is my mind that sets me apart.  Iâm not sure how to describe what it takes people years to understand about me.  As a matter of fact, I wonât even try.  It will come out, be recognizable, if I continue to use this place as outlet for my thoughts and emotions.

      My wife is probably the most wonderful person that God has ever created.  She has never had an enemy, never had a single person think badly of her in almost any way.  She is about as near to perfect as God has ever made.  Except when it comes to forgiveness.  But not forgiving in general, because she has a compassionate heart and can forgive anyone almost anything.  Note the âalmostâ part closely, because I am the only one that she can not forgive.  When we were married, we were about 21 years old, and I wasnât mature enough to understand love at all, or maybe I chose not to, whatever.  In any case, I  really liked  her a lot and she was totally in love.  It didnât take me long, however to really fall in loveâ¦she was all I wanted, all I needed.  Many men might make that claim about their woman, but I think it is a rare situation.  I was totally in love and there was not another woman for me.  I remember one day over lunch with a bunch of co-workers, all men, and they were talking about their infidelities.  I was maybe 24 years old at the time and the youngest at the table by far.  As they laughed about their conquests and their wives ignorance or duplicity (which still confuses me), I asked them: âHow can you do these things if you love your wives?â  The conversation stopped and they just looked at me.  One guy, I specifically remember him because he had been married four times, he said with gravity, âThere will come a day when you will cheat on your wife, I guarantee it.â  The rest of the crew just nodded their heads at that.  I blurted out, âThere is no way I could ever do that.  Since I was married, I havenât even been attracted to another woman.â  And I meant it with all of my heart.  I would have staked the lives of my future children on the truth of that statement.  That was who I was.  But, oh, how the mighty can fall.  It was only 4 years removed from that time that I was in a situation not of my doing that I failed.  I was in a different job, wielded a good bit of influence in the industry, and was making an obscene amount of money.  I had hired a new receptionist for the officeâ¦just a normal girl.  It turns out that she was looking for a sugar daddy and had set her designs upon me.  Now, Iâm just an ignorant country boy, not savvy to the subtleties of seduction, and I was hooked and landed like a big olâ catfish.  I was played for a fool and I failed the only promise that I truly wanted to keep.  Donât get me wrong, I take responsibility for it.  I was stupid, she was smart, she got what she wanted.  Everything I did, I did consciously and knowingly.  I just thought I could have some fun and move on.  Oh well, you fuck up, you pay the price.  The price I had to pay was the love of my wife.  She lost all trust in me, of course, and I did very little to resolve it.  That went on for years, she becoming bitter, me not caring, both committed to staying together.  It took forever for me to actually realize what an asshole I had been, but as you might guess, it was much too late.  So, I am married to this most wonderful woman that God created as nearly perfect and I guess, in a more true sense than it is for me, she is broken.  And she accepts it, like  urlLink my black pony .  That makes me feel like shit, kind of makes you not want to continue living if the best you can do is fuck up peopleâs lives.    She could never really forgive me, but that was my fault too, because I never showed the contrition that would come from true repentance.  By the time I figured out how badly I had treated her, she had built herself a substantial defense against any of my charms.  So I now stand outside her keep, calling to her, but the walls are so thick, she can't hear me.

      Gee, I spent the afternoon reading other blogs.  I'm kind of new to this blog-thing although I have been on the internet since before Al Gore called it that.  Somehow I ended up in a list of people with "broken" in the blog title.  I suppose I should change mine, because some of those people are  seriously  broken and I may just be cracked a little.  Well, I will leave it for now because broken is how I feel.  I remember growing up, we had a few horses on the farm.  My grandpa rode a bit and used them for working.  One year, one of the mares dropped this solid black colt, a beautiful animal.  He was gentle with me for months and I played with him like a pet.  As he got old enough to ride, he got mean.  No one was going to ride him if he had anything to do with it.  My grandpa got thrown a few times, and then my dad.  When the horse tossed them, he would turn and charge them while they were on the ground.  He was dang mean.  One day this cowboy shows up...turns out my grandpa had called in a bronc buster.  Mind you, now, this was the early '70s and animal cruelty wasn't a big deal to anyone.  The cowboy tied up that black horse and literally beat the shit of him.  He was there for 3 days and every time that pony would look at him, the cowboy would beat him.  He used a whip, he used a stick, he even used a board.  On the second day, the cowboy threw the saddle on him and the pony bucked...and took another beating.  It went on all day until the pony didn't move when the saddle was put on him.  Then the bit, same thing.  Then the cowboy climbed on him and beat him from on top of him.  I couldn't stand it and didn't watch much.  I remember my grandmother telling my grandpa to get that cowboy off the farm, but my grandpa just put his head down and said the horse needs to be broken.  On the third morning, the cowboy climbed on the horse and took off, beating the horse with this small club.  He didn't come back until after lunch.  I saw them coming from way off, the horse's head down like he had run a million miles.  As the cowboy walked him past me to the barn, the horse looked at me and I will never forget that look.  I thought I had never seen a sadder look in my life.  That was horse was broken.  He never gave anyone a second of trouble for the rest of his life.  When I named this blog, I thought I was no different than that black pony.  I am broken and I will never be the same again.  Annah tells me that I have a good life, and I do, and that when I think everything has gone to shit...look around...and compare myself to others and then see if I still think I got problems.  Well, Annah, everything is relative.

      Having had a marvelous lunch of burritos, beans, and rice; I thought I would note specifically why I am doing this now, this being blogging.  I have known Annah for over a year, but today I felt a change in the wind.  We haven't spoken in some time...weeks, months, I don't know.  I email her a lot, but she doesnât respond.  I am pretty sure that the emails aren't getting read.  Maybe an intelligent man would take that as a sign that she doesn't want to talk to me, maybe I am not an intelligent man? [That's rhetorical btw, so don't think about responding...]  In any case, I made a major mistake today.  I called her.  At her home.  I knowâ¦pretty stupid.  I try not to take many chances, but I had to hear her voice, I had to talk to her.  I want to blame her â say that if she would email me, I wouldnât end up at such a stupid place.  But that is me, blaming anyone but me for my mistakes.  Funny how people tend to do that, eh?  I only take the blame in retrospect, then it is to late and there is more blame to bear.  Oh well.  Yeah, I called her.  I knew her husband was gone to work and I hoped that her older children would still be in bed.  She has plenty of kids around the houseâ¦I donât know how she finds time to stay online so much (other than the addicting power of a MMPORPG).  So she answers the phone and doesnât really know who it is, certainly isnât expecting it to be me.  It takes a second for her to realize it is me and then I hear the quiet âShit!â under her breath.  I say hey and I can tell that she is freaking out and getting angrier by the second.  I just want to know what it was that I did wrong that caused her to ignore me so.  That is basically all my emails ask her also.  She kind of lays it out like this â I have crossed the line too many times.  I ask âwhat does that mean?â  I forget the exact words but it was something like âyou just wonât let it beâ.  Dangâ¦of course I wonât let it be.  I am 40-something years old and finally have met the first person that I can be absolutely open with.  I am not going to just walk away.  I shouldnât say that.  If she tells me to forget about her, walk away and never ever look back, I would do that.  But she doesnât say that.  She says to stop, to wait, to not push her.  I donât read anything into that at all and she isnât leading me on.  She needs time to do whatever she is doing.  Maybe she will decide she doesnât want me in her life ever.  I canât say I would like that, but I think would honor that.  But she hasnât told me to walk away, nor has she told me to expect anything from her.  Iâm OK with that because I love her.  One day she told me that she had heard a song that reminded her of meâ¦White Flag by Dido.  I downloaded it and listened and it became my theme, because it is me.  The chorus goes:  âI will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will beâ   So, to finish the phone call with Annah...she says not to email her, certainly not to call her.  She has some things going on and I don't help any...I distress her.  Her father had a major heart attack she is dealing with (her mother died a few years ago and her and her father are pretty close).  I can't say anything other than I am sorry.  There is nothing I can do, nothing she will let me do, to help her.  I wish I could talk to her, for her sake, during this time.  I don't think her husband talks to her much, I especially don't think he listens (just my opinion).  I say something to the effect of "So, I just wait until I hear from you then?" She says yeah.  I say goodbye, I hear a click.  What do you think?  I'm a fool, huh?

      I'm not crazy.  I'm just committed.  I have a life beyond my obsession of Annah.  I have many things that take up my time.  My job for instance.  I show up almost every day and usually accomplish something every week.  Not much, but something.  I think that is important.  I also have a family.  Kids and everything.  My children think I am the greatest father in the world.  Quite a few other people do also, but I think that the kids had more to do with it than I did.  I will tell you the type of person that I am...my kid's friends, ranging in age from 12 to 22, come to me for advice and counsel and guidance before they go anywhere else.  They trust that I will guide them straight, with wisdom, and without bias.  And that I do.  Another thing that is important to me is God.  You might be thinking...what a crazy guy.  He is married and chasing this other chica around, yet he says God is important to him.  And I say - yep, that's right.  And get this...I am a total conservative, fundementalist christian.  And yes, I expect that at many levels my desire to have a friendship with Annah is wrong.  But friendship is all I want, really.  Yeah, God and I are working on what all this means.  Don't condemn me for it, I do well enough condemning myself.

      When I am bored, I write.  I am not a writer, I am an engineer.  But I have a lot to say and no one to say it to.  My friend's name is Annah.  She lives 905 miles away, not that I have ever driven it.  I travel a lot by plane and have had the opportunity to be near her town.  That is when we met for real.  She has a thing about parking lots.  That is the only place I have ever met her...her leaning up against her car, me pacing around trying to keep my hands in my pockets.  She only had one rule...I couldn't touch her.  If you hold a real strict interpretation, I suppose I broke that rule...I tried to touch her hand and once, when saying goodbye, I wanted to pull her close.  I didn't get that far.  Anyway, she was big on her rules and I didn't do anything to make her feel to safe about that.  Annah is a beautiful woman.  In my eye, she is phenomenal.  She sent me a picture one day after we had been talking for some weeks and I nearly fell out of my chair.  She is simply beautiful.  We met online playing a MMPORPG.  Even though there are probably a few million people playing these games, I will not say which one, at least not yet.  We were introduced by a her friend.  I knew almost immediately that I was talking to a woman that would change my life if I let her.  now, don't get me wrong...she was not the assertive or aggressive one in pursuing a friendship.  She pretty much wanted nothing to do with me.  But when your mind (and your heart) tells you that you have found THE ONE, you just don't run away from that.  So, yeah, I pursued her.

      I suppose that a little background is in order.  If I was to write all about the situation that puts me here, it could be a novel.  Maybe not a good one, but a lengthy one for sure.  In essence, I am in love with married woman that is not my wife.  She is committed to her marriage, as am I, but she has decided that we can not be friends any longer.  That tears me to pieces...I wait for the "time heals all wounds" adage to become evident in my life, but I am quickly losing heart that such a thing will ever happen for me.  I think about her everyday, sometimes all day long.  I simply cannot put her out of my mind.  Obsessed you say?  I suppose that I have some obsessive qualities.  Lucky for everyone involved, I am harmless.  Simply put, I have a void in my life that my wife will not fill.  She used to, but doesn't anymore because of some events that were very painful for us and that she can't get past.  I don't blame her because it isn't her fault...it is mine.  The woman I have come to love, well, I met her online.  I have met her twice.  I have never touched her, but I dream of it.  I didn't understand exactly how I felt about her until one night when I was watching "Jerry McGuire".  There is a scene in an elevator when a deaf couple sign something to each other...they sign "you complete me".  Imeediately, I realized that is how I felt.  She completes me.  In a way I have never known before, she completes me.  And from what she tells me - I only distress her.  See my problem?

      I have things to say, but no one to say them to.  I can't talk to HER, because she told me that I couldn't...it distresses her.  I can't talk to my wife, but then again, I never could.  Friends...what is that, who are they?  I only had one real friend, I think.  That was HER.  So I will tell you.  Maybe you don't care, maybe you will come to care.  Maybe one day SHE will have a chance to see this and know that I am real and honest and that I care about her a great deal.  Maybe.

       It has a been a while since I wrote here, just a few weeks I guess. I have been travelling a good bit and I really didn't have anything to say.      But to catch up...because something did happen with Annah -       She and I both post on a particular forum, me quite a bit more than her. I am pretty well known there and very opinionated in my posts. There also happens to be an ongoing post about "tell me your problems" kind of thing. One day I was just checking to see if she had been online and posted anything...yep, I'm at that level of obsession since she quit communicating with me...and she had. She had posted saying that someone that 'everyone knew' used to be her friend and then something happened and they weren't friends anymore and now he is being inappropriate.      Inappropriate? What the hell does that mean? In any case, I stared at her post and what people were saying - like "what a jerk", "maybe he's a stalker", blah blah blah. No one knew it was me that she was talking about or they would have taken up for me...saying no way Rotohombre could be like that, it must be some misunderstanding, etc. - because everybody loves me :) - In any case, just looking at her post, I sensed that whatever love that she had for me, and she professed it often so I believed it, but I saw it was dead. Reason unknown.      I sent her one last email in a way that I knew she would get it...and I said goodbye and that I would stop looking for her or waiting for her. No response of course...but that's that. Goodbye Annah - have a nice life.      So where does that leave me? Well, that is what I have been thinking about and the only answer that I can come up with is...it leaves me quite alone. And quite lonely.      I know I write here pretty much for myself. I doubt anyone sees stops by. If you do - and you are alone like me - let me know. Just say hi. Maybe we can commensurate about our fucked up lives and loves, eh? The one I want to talk to is the Rambler with a broken soul...but she seems to have disappeared...
