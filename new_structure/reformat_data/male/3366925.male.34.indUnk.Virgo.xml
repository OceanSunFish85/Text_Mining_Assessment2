      TIGER HAS LOST âITâ       With 8 major championships and 47 tournament wins worldwide, Tiger Woods, at the young age of 29, has lost âitâ. I know itâs hard to believe. The golfer that everyone predicted would break every known record in the sport. The one who captured all four majors before his 26th birthday. The man who has faced every challenge in the sport and known nothing but success. But itâs true. Heâs lost âitâ.       What exactly is âitâ, you ask? Well, âitâ isnât talent. Tiger will always be the most talented golfer in any tournament he enters. He can pull off shots on a golf course that nobody else even thinks to try.       âItâ isnât competitiveness. Tiger is the most competitive golfer on tour. He thrives on competition and winning. Itâs almost as if he sometimes wills putts into the hole to keep himself in a tournament.      Desire isnât the âitâ that Iâm talking about. Many have said that his engagement to Elin Nordegren has diminished his desire to win. Hogwash! Tiger is driven by the desire to be the best ever and that hasnât changed. His quest in golf isnât to beat todayâs PGA players in the majors, but to beat Jack Nicklausâs all-time record of 18 majors. No, itâs not the desire that heâs lost.      So what is âitâ? What has Tiger lost? The âitâ that Tiger has lost is the intimidation factor he once had on tour. Not too long ago, other players would wilt under the pressure of playing against Tiger when he was on the leaderboard. Ernie Els said that when Tiger played in a tournament, the rest of the players were playing for second place. Vijay crumbled like a Leggo house down the stretch of the 2002 Masters which Tiger went on to win. So did Ernie and Phil Mickelson. Speaking of Mickelson, he choked in the face of Tiger during countless majors in the past six years. And Davis Love III, basically speaking for the entire tour, once said that if Tiger played his best, no one on tour could come close to beating him. And those are the best golfers in the world not named Tiger. How do you think the rest of the tour was feeling? Think he intimidated more than a few golfers?       Before two weeks ago, Tiger had won 18 straight tournaments in which he held the lead after 36 holes (halfway). And he didnât always have to play his best golf to win those tournaments. There were times that he could win by shooting even par on the weekend, because other golfers simply didnât step up to challenge him. And when they did step up, Tiger would step up also, and the others would eventually fold. Tiger was great at playing as good as he needed to play to win on the weekend, but he didnât always have to play his best golf to do it.      However, all of that has changed recently. Tiger led the Wachovia Championship after 36 holes two weeks ago and led the Byron Nelson Championship at the halfway point last week. He failed to win either tournament. But the shocking thing isnât that he failed to win; the shocking thing is who passed him on the leaderboard each week. It wasnât Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, or any of the other prominent players on tour. No, Tiger was overtaken by the likes of Aaron Oberholser, Joey Sindelar, Robert Damron, and Dudley Hart. Not exactly a whoâs who of the PGA Tour.       The fact is, Tiger no longer holds the intimidation edge over the tour that he once held. In this yearâs Masters tournament, Tiger made a mild charge at the beginning of the final day, but instead of folding under pressure, Ernie, Vijay, and Phil continued to birdie holes and pull away from him. Vijay is even close to doing the impossible â overtaking Tiger for the world #1 ranking.       Now donât get me wrong. Iâm not saying that Tiger Woods is finished. Iâm not even saying he isnât the best in the world. Heâs still the golfer I would put my bet on each week to win. However, heâs not the sure bet that he once was. And itâs not because the rest of the world is closing the gap, itâs just that they donât fear him like they once did. Itâs like the old playground tale â once one person stands up to the bully, he doesnât look so tough to the rest of the kids, either.

           Barry Bonds is on pace to not only break the single season record for intentional walks, heâs on pace to shatter it. Bonds has 29 intentional walks through 38 games. Heâs on pace to have 124 for the season. That will almost DOUBLE the all-time record of 68 that Bonds had in 2002. This amazing pace has many baseball âexpertsâ asking baseball to eliminate the intentional walk rule. They say that the intentional walk is unfair to Bonds and unfair to the fans who come to the park to watch him hit. They say the intentional walk isnât playing baseball. If weâre going to play baseball, then letâs play baseball, gosh darnit!       The pleading for this rule change has me thinking: What rules can we change to fix other sports?      Weâll start with football. Letâs eliminate that stupid âUnnecessary Roughnessâ rule. Hey folks, football is a rough sport. Thatâs just the way it is. So to have this rule in football is like sending a kid to a candy store and telling them to stay away from the sweets. Now I donât want to sound like XFL creator Vince McMahon, but if weâre going to play football, then letâs play football!      In basketball, the goaltending rule seems ridiculous. Letâs get rid of it. Hey, the object of basketball is to get the ball in the basket and on defensive, the object is to stop it from going in the basket. Defenders shouldnât be so limited on how they stop it from going in the basket. I mean, if weâre going to play basketball, then letâs play basketball!      Golf has all of these âgentlemanâ rules that need to go. No talking while your opponent is hitting, no walking in your opponentâs line. For crying out loud, you canât even laugh or make fun of your opponent when they hit a bad shot. This all seems silly to me. To win in golf, you have to have less strokes than your opponent, so you should be able to do this by all means necessary. If weâre going to golf, then letâs golf. (And how about some realism on the PGA Tour. Letâs see those guys drink a few beers during the round.)      Itâs time to change a really stupid rule in NASCAR. In a NASCAR race, your goal is to go faster than the other cars and to finish the race quicker than the other cars. So letâs change that stupid speed limit rule on pit road. Cars should be able to cruise down pit road as fast as they want, right? It is a race, isnât it? Come on, man! If weâre going to race, letâs race!       And why is it that we penalize players for fighting in hockey? Isnât that the whole reason fans go to the arena? Havenât I heard it said that fighting is part of the game? The penalty for fighting needs to be eliminated and we need to have a penalty if someone refuses to fight. I mean, if weâre going to fight, er â¦ play hockey, then letâs play hockey.       Canât you see how much better sports can be with just a little tweaking? By eliminating these silly rules, we can make the world of sports a much better place. Good, rough play in football. Some solid defense in basketball. Maybe some physical play in golf â definitely some more fire. Real racing in NASCAR, and a reason to watch the action on pit road. Great fights in hockey, and a lot of them. And a reason for Giants fans to come back to the park. No more walking Barry Bonds.       Changing these rules would certainly make a lot more sense than the Giants having to go out and get a decent hitter to put behind Bonds.
