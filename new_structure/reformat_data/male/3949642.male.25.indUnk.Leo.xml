      This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work...    The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------      âThose that I fight I do not hate,   Those that I guard I do not love;â  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)  It was all white in the room, The corpse in his winding sheet, My aunt in a new white sari, Staring into the silence where he had gone. I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didnât cry.  She had gone crazy, my mom whispered, Between her sobs, âShe is just 25, the poor girlâ I just continued to look down, At the mosaic floor, not registering a word. I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldnât cry.  My cousin sister came to me, Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion. She was five, did she understand? I took her out to buy her chocolate. I could hear the neighborsâ shushing as we went by, But I still didnât cry.  On my way back in the train, Three passengers were discussing the police, âAll corrupt sons of bitches â they deserve to dieâ I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform. I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre, Thatâs when I cried.   --V.
