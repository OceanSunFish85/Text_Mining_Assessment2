Isso o ensinarÃ¡ a man ter sua boca fechada." ( Ernest Hemingway )      "Algumas vezes quando reflito acerca de toda a cerveja que jÃ¡ bebi, e me sinto envergonhado. Mas logo vejo alÃ©m do copo e penso nos trabalhadores da cervejaria e seus sonhos e esperanÃ§as.Se eu nÃ£o bebesse esta cerveja,eles poderiam perder seus trabalhos e todos os seus sonhos veriam-se desfeitos.Portanto eu digo, "Ã melhor que eu beba esta cerveja permitindo que seus sonhos se tornem realidade do que eu seja egoÃ­sta e me preocupe com meu fÃ­gado." ( Jack Handy )      "Algumas vezes um homem inteligente Ã© forÃ§ado a ficar bÃªbado para passar um tempo com os burros." ( Ernest Hemingway )      "Quando bebemos, ficamos bÃªbados. Quando ficamos bÃªbados,dormimos.Quando dormimos nÃ£o cometemos pecados.Quando nÃ£o cometemos pecados vamos para o cÃ©u...Portanto, vamos ficar bÃªbados para ir ao cÃ©u!!!" ( Brian O'Rourke )        E ESSA Ã A MELHOR...MENSAGEM PUBLICITÃRIA EM UM A CERVEJA DA NORUEGA  : "Ajudando as feias a fazer sexo desde 1862"
