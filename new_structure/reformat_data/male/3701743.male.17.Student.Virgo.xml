      I did my economics exam and I guess I passed (at least a 5.9). Yesterday I watched soccer with friends (Netherlands-Letvia, 3-0!). We (in future read: the Dutch team) are through to the quarterfinals.  I believe that we play Saturday against the Swedish national team. Today I worked in the shop but it was raining so it was very quiet. Iâm very tired now because I did not sleep much last week, especially yesterday but Iâll live.

      One more day untill my economics exam. I did not learn much yesterday (read: nothing). Today I got out of bed late and got my daily espresso (read:caffeine-shot) at the italian ice-cream shop where I work with Dale.  After that I went back home and turned on the computer so here I am. I decided to not read all the 900 pages again but practice on my economics by reading some old exams I found on the internet. Wish me luck! The pics are taken on the terrace from the  urlLink karseboom  where I spent a lot of my time.  I wish I would be here now!  urlLink    Ale   urlLink    Ale and cards   urlLink    Some more ale .  urlLink    Dale and me   urlLink    View from the terrace and a little piece of Tim

      Sitting here behind my computer. I already graduated but Iâll do my economics-exam again to raise my grade from a six to a seven (scale: 1-10). The problem is that my mind is on vacation and I canât get my mind on economics.  Luckily the highest grade will count so itâs not a big deal when I tinker my second economics exam (got a 4.2 for the first one, I need a 4.9 for a seven). Iâll stop typing now and try to focus on the 900 pages in front of me.
