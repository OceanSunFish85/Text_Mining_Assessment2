      Bart arrives home from school, littering the hallway with his skateboard  and knapsack.  Bart enters his messy room and feeds his pet frog.   Out in the hallway, Homer complains about the mess, picking up a Krusty  doll to illustrate his point.  Bart's skateboard introduces Homer to the  quick way to get downstairs.  (``D'oh!  D'ah!  Son-of-a!  D'aargh!'')  His back injured, Homer is unable to move, his only company Bart's  Krusty doll, which says, ``I like to play with  '' over and over and  over and over again.  SLH wanders in.  ``Go get help, boy.''  The dog licks  Homer's face and takes a nap.   Maggie crawls over Homer's face, then quiets him with her pacifier.  Maggie naps next to her father.  Pull upward to show Homer lying on  the floor, surrounded by Maggie, the pets, and a Krusty doll whose  batteries are near death.   Marge and Lisa arrive home, and Homer says, ``The boy.  Bring me the boy.''  Marge storms into Bart's messy room and yells, ``If you had cleaned  your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still  be aligned!''  While tossing his junk into the closet, Bart discovers...  a cherry bomb.  ``I thought I blew all you guys up!''   Recess.  Principal Skinner patrols the schoolyard, accompanied by his  mother.  Bart shows the explosive to his pals, who ask him what he's  going to do with it.  Before he can answer, Principal Skinner arrives,  and the foursome (Bart, Milhouse, Lewis and Richard) quickly line up and  greet Principal Skinner in unison.  Mrs. Skinner asks Spanky to introduce  the boys, and he does so.        Mrs. Skinner: This is the Bart Simpson you're always talking about?    Pr. Skinner:  Mm hm.    Mrs. Skinner: Why, he looks so sweet!    Bart:         I am, ma'am.    -- He also lies, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      In the boys' room...        Milhouse: You going to flush it?  [a cherry bomb]    Bart:     What can I say?  I got a weakness for the classics.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Mrs. Skinner pays a visit to the little girls' room just as Bart flushes  the cherry bomb.  Obvious consequences ensue.   At the Simpsons' residence...        Homer: [lying on the couch]  Oh, Maaarge, I'm still hurt!               \          [rings a handbell]  Maaarge!   Maaaaaarge!    Marge: [finally arrives]  Oh, Homer.  How many times do I have to fluff           your pillow?    Homer: Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled-cheese           sandwich?    Marge: [reluctantly]  Well, okay.    Homer: Make sure it's squished flat, and crunchy on the outside.    Marge: I know how you like 'em, Homer.    Homer: Oh, and can I have some of those wieners that come in a can?           Oh, and some fruit cocktail, in heavy syrup.    Marge: Mmmmm...    -- Milking an injury, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      The doorbell rings, and Homer rings the handbell.  ``Maaaaarge!  Maaarge!  MARGE!  GET THE DOOR!''  Marge peers through the peephole and gets a  distorted view of Principal Skinner.  Bart escapes to his room as Marge  brings Principal Skinner into the living room.  Homer remains on the couch.        Homer:  Oh, hello, Principal Skinner.  I'd get up, but the boy crippled me.    Principal Skinner: Mm hm.  I understand completely.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Pr. Skinner:  Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible.           I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick.  I think it           behooves us all to consider... deportation.    Marge: Deportation!?  You mean, kick Bart out of the country?    Homer: Eh, hear him out, Marge.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Skinner admits to being overly melodramatic.        Pr. Skinner:  Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange           program.  Normally, a student is selection on the basis of academic           excellence or intelligence.  But in Bart's case... I'm prepared to           make a   exception.  And if you're willing to play along, he can           be spending the next three months studying far, far away.    Homer: Sounds great!    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Marge scolds Homer for agreeing even without knowing what country Bart  is going to.        Pr. Skinner: He'd be staying in France, in a lovely chateau in the heart           of the wine country.    Marge: But Bart doesn't speak French.    Pr. Skinner: Oh, when he's fully immersed in a foreign language, the average           child can become fluent in weeks!    Homer: Yeah, but what about Bart?    Pr. Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      The Simpsons will be asked to host a student in exchange.        Wait a minute, Skinner.  How do we know some principal over in France isn't    pulling the same scam you are!    -- Homer learns that Bart has been selected for an exchange program,       ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Pr. Skinner: You'll be getting an Albanian.    Homer: You mean, all white with pink eyes?    -- Student exchange program, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Marge thinks Bart should have some say in the matter.        Ah, the life of a frog.  That's the life for me.    -- Bart, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Bart loves the idea of going to France.        He makes   crazy twelve months a year.  At least you get the summer off.    -- Homer chats with Principal Skinner, ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Bart:  And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?    Marge: Yes, Bart.    Bart:  And one back?    -- We'll think about it, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Marge returns with Bart and announces that Bart has given the green light.  Principal Skinner and Homer leap to their feet and exchange high fives.   [End of Act One.  Time: 5:44]   At Springfield International Airport, Marge kisses her ``special little guy''  good-bye.  Lisa scowls, ``What do you know about France?''  Bart sneers  back, ``I know I'm going and you're not.''        Always remember that you're representing your country.  I guess what I'm    saying is...  Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.    -- Homer sends Bart to France, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Bart is (literally) loaded onto the plane.  Meanwhile, in Tirana, Albania,  a young boy bids farewell to his family.  (Mom, Dad, boy, sister, and baby  girl.  Hmm...)   Upon arrival in Paris, Bart is greeted by a surly young gentleman.  ``Okay,  kid, let's go.''  Bart rides sidecar through the French countryside to  Ch\^ateau Maison, a dilapidated vineyard.  An older man tells his donkey,  ``Ah, Maurice.  Once the American boy arrives, your days of back-breaking  work labor will be over.''  Bart arrives.   Meanwhile, the rest of the family await the arrival of the exchange student.  Lisa reads from a reference book.        Lisa:  You know, in Albania, the unit of currency is called the lek.    Homer: Heh heh heh.  The lek!    Lisa:  And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.    Homer: Give me the ol' stars-and-stripes!    Lisa:  And the main export is furious political thought.    Homer: Political what?    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      The plane carrying the exchange student lands.   Meanwhile, the older gentleman (Cesar) introduces his nephew Huguolin (the  gentleman who picked up Bart at the airport).        You will find life here at the ch\^ateau hard, but if you shut up and    do exactly what we say, the time will pass more quickly.    -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      ``He's right, you know,'' adds Huguolin.   The young boy deplanes and greets the family members by name.  He kisses  Homer once on each cheek.  ``Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he.''   Bart's hosts go through his luggage and divvy up the proceeds.   The students are gathered to welcome Adil Hoxha.        You might find his accent peculiar.  Certain aspects of his culture may seem    absurd, perhaps even offensive.  But I urge you all to give little Adil the    benefit of the doubt.  This way, and only in this way, do we hope to better    understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.    -- Principal Skinner's introduction, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Adil addresses his fellow students.   Cesar, Huguolin, and Maurice walk cheerfully along, followed by Bart,  straining under the weight of water buckets.   Dinnertime at the Simpsons.        Adil:  How can you defend a country where five percent of the people           control ninety-five percent of the wealth?    Lisa:  I'm defending a country where people can think and act           and worship any way they want.    Adil:  Cannot!    Lisa:  Can too!    Adil:  Cannot!    Lisa:  Can too!    Homer: Please, please, kids, stop fighting.           Maybe Lisa's right about America being the land of opportunity,           and maybe Adil's got a point about the machinery of capitalism           being oiled with the blood of the workers.    -- The thoughts of a worker who does not control the means of production,       ``The Crepes of Wrath''      This succeeds in defusing the situation.        Marge: I'll just clean the dishes...    Adil:  No, Mrs. Simpson, you have been oppressed enough today.             will clear the dishes.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Did you see that?  This is the way I always wanted it to be!  We've become    a fully-functioning family unit!  We've always blamed ourselves, but I    guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.    -- Homer trades Bart for Adil, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Lisa leaves the table in disgust.        Oh, she's just jealous.  She'll get over it.    And if she doesn't, we can always exchange her!  Heh, heh, heh.    -- Homer on Lisa's recent ourburst, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Cesar and Huguolin enjoy their dinner of sausage, while Bart eats a raw  turnip.  Huguolin orders Bart to go to sleep, and points at a pile of hay.  But Maurice beats Bart to it, leaving our hero to sleep on the floor.   Homer tucks Adil into bed.        Homer: Look, Adil, you can call me `Dad'.    Adil:  All right... `Dad'.    Homer: Awwww, you called me `Dad'.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Adil asks to see the nuclear power plant.        None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work...    -- Homer, upon Adil's request to see SNPP, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Homer gladly agrees.  Adil says quietly to himself, ``Excellent...''   Cesar instructs Bart on the proper way to pluck grapes.  ``Now do it a  million times.''   Homer takes Adil to SNPP.        See these?  American donuts.  Glazed, powdered, and raspberry-filled.    Now, how's   for freedom of choice!    -- Homer introduces Adil to the American workplace, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Adil asks to see the plutonium isolation module.        Homer: Hey, Lenny, does this place have one of those plutonium           isolation deals?    Lenny: Yeah, in Sector 12.    Homer: Sector 12?    Lenny: Third floor, by the candy machine.    Homer: Oh,   Sector 12!    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Bart carefully plucks grapes.  He looks around and pops one into his  mouth.  Huguolin whaps him on the back, causing Bart to spit out the  grape. ``Ungrateful swine!  We give you food, we give you shelter, and  this is how you repay us?''   A radiation-suited Adil snaps photos furiously as Homer takes him through  the plant.  They reach the plutonium isolation module, marked ``TOP SECRET''.  Adil snaps away, and Homer keeps leaning into the frame to wave hello.  ``D'oh, wait a minute.''  Homer removes his radiation hood and smiles  for the camera.   Bart unhappily stomps grapes.  ``I hate France, ungh, ungh, ungh.''   Marge and Homer chat in bed.  A framed portrait of Adil hangs on the wall.  Marge makes Homer admit that he loves Bart, and Homer makes Marge admit  that Adil is a very sweet boy.  (``Darn tootin'!'')   Pan out Bart's window to the treehouse, which is filled with electronics  equipment.  Adil prepares a fax machine and tunes his radio.  ``Sparrow to  Nest.  Sparrow to Nest.  Stand by for transmission.''  In Tirana, the fax  is received.  ``I told you the Sparrow would not fail.''  The two generals  admire the photo of the plutonium isolation module, with a smiling Homer  standing in front of it.   [End of Act Two.]   His feet purple with grape juice, Bart reads a letter from Marge.        We think Maggie may say her first word any day now.    -- Marge's letter to Bart, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Bart finishes the letter, moans quietly, and blows out the candle.   Cesar and Huguolin inspect the wine vats.  Cesar is optimistic about this  year's harvest, but Huguolin notes that the wine has been fermenting for  only three days.        Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supr\^emes faiblit,    je pense toujours au miracle de l'anti-freeze.    -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Whenever my faith in God is shaken, I think of the miracle of anti-freeze.    -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      ``Too much can be poison, but the right amount gives wine just the right  kick.''  Cesar mixes some antifreeze with the wine.  Bart coughs outside,  and Cesar shoos him away, then reconsiders.  He invites Bart in.  (``Watch.  I bet it won't even blind him.'')        Cesar: [shoves a cup of wine in Bart's face]  Drink this.    Bart:  Oh, no thanks.    Cesar: Do not worry.  This is France.  It is customary for children to take           a little wine now and then.    Bart:  Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.    Cesar: Drink it!    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Bart swallows hard, downs the wine, belches, and waits.  Cesar waves his  hand in front of Bart's face.        He sees well enough.  Now go buy a case of anti-freeze.    -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Huguolin doesn't want to go out in the rain, so they send Bart.   Bart pedals to Paris in search of 14 Rue Voltaire, but gives up.  He flags  down a passing policeman.  Unfortunately, there's a language problem.  The policeman unwraps a candy.  ``Voil\`a un bonbon.''  Bart reluctantly  takes it but is unable to communicate.  ``Je suis d\'esol\'e.''  Bart  walks away, dejected.        I'm so stupid.  Anybody could've learned this dumb language by now.    Here, I've listened to nothing but French for the past |{deux mois,}                                                           |[two months,]    {et je ne sais pas un mot.}    [And I haven't learned a word.]    {Eh!  Mais, je parle Fran\c{c}ais maintenant!}    [Wait!  I'm talking French now!]    {Incroyable!}    [Incredible!]    -- Bart learns French, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      He rushes back to the policeman.        Bart: You gotta help me.  These two guys work me night and day.          They don't feed me.  They make me sleep on the floor.          They put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave          my red hat to the donkey.    Policeman: [shocked]          Anti-freeze in the wine?  That is a very serious crime.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Homer arrives home with something tucked under his arm.        Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted.    I'm telling you, he's such a curious little Dickens.    I bet he could   a nukeeler power plant if he wanted to!    -- Homer fetches classified information for Adil, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      A voice calls to the Sparrow to surrender.  Homer goes outside to see  what the to-do is about.        Homer: I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?    Agent: [through the megaphone]  Well, sir, the...           [turns off the megaphone] Well, sir...    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      The agent explains that they're closing in on a spy code-named ``The  Sparrow''.  Homer thinks Adil might get a kick out of this.  Adil  nervously drops his microphone out of the treehouse and attracts  attention.  Homer waves hello, and is quickly trampled by dozens of  FBI agents.   In France, Cesar and Huguolin are placed in a paddy-wagon.  ``Au revoir,  suckers!'' says Bart.  Bart makes headlines and receives a medal.   At Springfield Airport, the agent explains that they will trade Adil  for one of their own spies that had been captured.  The spy looks an  awful lot like Bart.        Spy:  So, Sparrow, we meet again.    Adil: Yes.  Sometimes I think that I am getting too old for this game.    -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Adil bids the Simpsons farewell, and Marge and Lisa mumble farewell.        Good-bye, Adil!  I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted!    -- Homer bids farewell to an Albanian spy, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Flight mille neuf cent quatre-vingt huit arrives from Paris.  Bart leaps  off the plane and greets his family.  Lisa checks the bags Bart was  carrying.  ``He brought us gifts!  His first unselfish act.''   In the kitchen, Bart concludes his story.        So, basically, I met one nice French person.    -- Bart's summary of his trip to France, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      Lisa says, ``It's good to see you,'' and Bart reflects the sentiment.  Marge asks to try the wine Bart brought, as Homer struggles to open it.        Some wise-guy stuck a cork in the bottle!    -- Homer struggles to open a wine bottle, ``The Crepes of Wrath''        Mon p\`ere!  Quel bouffon!    -- Bart, ``The Crepes of Wrath''      ``Ya hear that, Marge?  My boy speaks French!''  Homer finally uncorks  the bottle with his teeth.   [End of Act Three.]
