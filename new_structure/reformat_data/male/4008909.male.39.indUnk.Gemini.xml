      Friday's Oregonian carried an editorial opinion on how Portland baseball fans could make a major league stadium a reality without using public dollars. Yeah, right.   After claiming that all public dollars should be used for education (a noble cause), the writer went on to state that Portland baseball fans should follow the Green Bay Packer model and fund a privately owned stadium through stock sales. Sounds great until you check the very numbers offered up in the article. Its really simple - just sell 1.75 Million shares at 200 bucks a pop. That is roughly one share for each person in the metro area... regardless of whether or not they have a job. Or if they like baseball.   Reality check: Average family investment - $800.There are not 450,000 families in the Portland metro area that invested $800 instock, or even savings, last year. Itmight be different if you got something for your $800... but you won't. You will still pay the same amount in taxes. You will still have to buy the $2,000 charter seat license to get tickets. You will still have to pay$15 per gamefor parking. You will still pay$6 for a beer. You will still pay $200 for a seat behind home plate. Otherwise, those 1.75 Million stockholders willlose money.   This might all work if stadiums made money. They do not.  You disagree?Oregon Arena Corp. Rose Garden. Portland Family Entertainment. PGE Park.   Need more examples?  The fact of the matter is stadiums do not make money unless they are owned and operated by the primary tenant.Major League franchise owners like to own the stadium because theyeffectivelyeliminate their rent,keep all the revenue from concessions (the real money maker), luxury boxes, ticket sales, and parking fees. If you own a stadium but do not own the franchise, forget it. Theprofessional sports franchise owner has the leverage. You will share - or give up - all of these sources of revenue or you will be stuck with a National Curling League franchise as your primary tenant.   So does this mean city and stategovernments should never invest in stadiums? No.Investing in stadiumsto attract or retain professional sports franchises can still make a lot of sense for metro areas.Not because of the direct revenue but as amechanism to create(or retain) jobs related to the construction and operation of the facility.And for the indirect revenue generated by people traveling from out of state to catch two or three ball games over the course of a season (inPortland's case, from Washington  Idaho) orfrom the additional taxes generated by new businesses opening near the stadium.  Would I pay the $200 for stock in a new stadium? Or $800 for an entire family? Yes. Because I believe inOregon and the Portland metro area as well as the benefits Major League baseball (or NHL or NFL) would bring toallresidents. ButI am not foolish enough to believe there are 1,749,999 other peoplein the Portland metro area that feel the same way. If there were, the Expos would be in their third season in Portland.

      Tonight we learn the Expos will spurn the Rose City in favor of the DC area. Last week the MLS ignored Soccer City USA and announced an expansion franchise in Salt Lake City (are you kidding me?). Councilman Frankie's big shot act drove long time partner, Champ Carout of town on Monday.... you don't  really  think IRL is interested in Portland, do you?   Meanwhile, the Oregon Sports Authority is geeked up that Portland made the short list... of 20... cities that may land the Dew Action Sports Tour. Great. I can go hang outat Pioneer Square or Old Townfor free if I want to watch a bunch of stoners skate. I don't need NBC's made-for-TV psuedo sports for that. Besides... how embarrasing is it going to be when we lose to Tacoma or some other redneck burg after Drew Mahalic basically said that we would do anything to get them here?It is goodto see the OSA is shooting for the stars.   PDX's major league future looks bleak. But does it have to?
