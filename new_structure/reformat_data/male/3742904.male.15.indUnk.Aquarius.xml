      Here's some more of those pesky personality tests...   Gravitation Character:   Well, I got Yuki, but for some reason, the page cannot be found or something like that... Could someone tell me what Yuki is like? Thanks :).    X-men Character:     You are Wolverine!  A loner by nature, you feel uncomfortable when around those you don't know and even those you do.  You are awkward when it comes to relationships, but fiercely loyal to those you love.    urlLink   Which X-Men character are you most like?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Cool! I've always liked Wolverine.  He's so cool.   Anime Legend:    urlLink       urlLink theOtaku.com: What Anime Legend Are You?      Tenshi Muyo Girl:    urlLink       urlLink theOtaku.com: What Tenchi Muyo Girl Are You?    Yes, I took a test on what girl I was, but at least I got Ryoko!   Forest Creature:    urlLink       urlLink theOtaku.com: What Forest Creature Are You?    Awesome! This is my favorite character in that movie.   Cowboy Bebop Character:    urlLink       urlLink theOtaku.com: What Cowboy Bebop Crew Member Are You?    Wow, that's a weird looking Faye pic!   Anime Type:        urlLink What Anime Type Are You?    No, just kidding, what I really got was:       urlLink What Anime Type Are You?    =D   Elemental Wolf:     Youre the wolf of fire! You are the one who is most likely to be a leader. The wolf of fire has a deep passion for almost anything and is very noble. They are athletic and rough but are still tender on the inside. These are probably not the most rare type but they are still very special. A fire wolf is such a cool being the way they eat and hunt together. If you are the fire wolf then you are very social and proud although you are not always loyal. But, still being the fire wolf is a good thing because they are strong and do most things independently.     urlLink   What Elemental Wolf Are You? (with pics/read memo)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Now that is cool!    Greek God:     Hecate    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Alright, that's it for now, there'll be more to come later on :).
