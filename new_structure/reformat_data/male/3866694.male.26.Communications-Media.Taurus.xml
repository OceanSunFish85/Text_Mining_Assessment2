      Well, youâre either here because you know me or because of a search engine mishap. I signed on here in the hopes that I could maintain some sort of web journal, since thatâs what the kids are doing these days. That, and it makes me feel important, a side-effect of living in a media-saturated post-modern society. Youâre not really somebody unless other people pay attention to you. Iâm going to try to keep it updated regularly, but donât hold me to that.   Iâm basically going to use this page to rant or rave about various topics, though I think there will be a focus on five main interests: my wife Shannon, who is also my best friend and easily the most interesting person in the world (you should probably be reading her page instead of this); my daughter Emily, who turned three months old last week; movies, a topic I occasionally claim to know something about; music, something I couldnât imagine living without; and video games, which essentially suck up my free time like some sort of all-consuming rift in the fabric of space and time.   I discovered this site through Bill Harris, a talented and eloquent writer who maintains his own site over   urlLink here . He was a long-time contributer to Gone Gold, where his thrice-weekly column was the main draw to that site for me. Anyway, I highly recommend that you check it out.   So, as I said earlier, Emily turned three months old last week. I donât know how that happened so fast. Sheâs doing really well, though. At least, I assume she is, having never done this before. Itâs so funny how something will strike her as absolutely hilarious, and then 30 seconds later will have her tearing up. Iâm starting to think that she knows how her tears and pouting face can pretty much bring me to my knees. Shannon says sheâs got me wrapped around her little finger, and sheâs pretty much on the money. This could be bad in later years, but I donât know what to do. Sheâs just so adorable.   As I was driving to work today, I was listening to Ben Foldsâ solo album â Rockinâ the Suburbs. I havenât listened to it in a while and I realized today, again, that itâs a damn fine record. Obviously, his piano is up to snuff, but the lyrics are so well-written; the songs run the gamut from hilarious to heart-rending. The last track, âThe Luckiest,â may well be the best love song ever writtenâ¦well maybe not, but itâs up there. I guess I must have been feeling sentimental today, because the part about the 90-year-old man dying and then being followed by his wife two days later brought tears to my eyes. Iâm not ashamed to admit it. Ok, maybe a little ashamed.
