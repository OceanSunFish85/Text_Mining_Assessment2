      Today I want to talk about hugs.  I donât know when to give a hug - or receive a hug.  I thought I did.  Now Iâm not so sure.  I know the basics of hugging, I think.  Family members, hug.  Close friends, hug.  Salesperson at the Apple Store, depending on the price, hug to full on tongue kiss.  Too bad itâs not always so clear.  Have you ever gone to give a person a hug because you think your relationship is at that point and then they donât return the hug?  Youâre kind of in trouble because youâve already made this commitmentâ¦(gesture with your armâs)â¦and then they lean away from you so really the only thing you can now do is say, âI caught a fish this big,â and hope that they donât want to see it.  You could just hug them, knowing theyâre not going to hug you back, pick them off the ground and yell out a random number hoping to be close to their weight so they are at least impressed with your carnival like skills and want to hug you for that.  Or, you can also just make it weird for them for not.  You can hug them very tight, pat their head and whisper softly into their ear, âeverythingâs gonna be alright.â  Cause it will.  Be careful of the hug.  Once you establish a hug relationship you are in it till the end.  That can mean five to six hugs in the course of a day with one person, which in turn can mean sixty hugs, depending on how many hug relationships your in at the time.  And you think your just hugging that person, but your not.  Youâre hugging everyone that that person is in a hug relationship with.  Pretty soon youâre up to one, two hundred hugs a day which even a teddy bear will tell you is crazy.  It can get to the point that from all the hugging that buttons are wearing off your shirts and worn out arm patterns are grooving into the fabric around your sides.  Everything is fine then one day you donât give the hug or even worse you donât receive the hug.  You think to yourself, âI wonder what that was about?â  Then you ask the person, âhey I noticed today you didnât give me a hug.  You just gave me one of those head nods.â  And a head nod isnât bad at all but going from a hug to head nod is bad.  It just might be the worst things ever.  I blame hip-hop for the state that hugging is in.  I love hip-hop music, but for all the good itâs done in the world itâs really muddied the waters for huggers.  There is the, âlean-in-like-your-gonna-hug-but-just-touch-chests-without-the-use-of-arms-hug.â  Not as confusing as it sounds, but this is where it starts.  Next, you have the, âlean-in-touch-shoulders-half-hug-with-opposite-arm.â  That one can be added onto with the, âpull-away-hand-shake-thingy,â but now youâre into handshakes and thatâs a whole other demon.  The other day I was thinking about handshakes and more importantly secret handshakes and how funny it is when you meet someone that is part of a group that has a secret handshake you try to convince them to show it to you.  You argue, âcome on, show me.â  They respond, âsorry canât do it.â  You counter, ânobody will know.â  They state, âitâs a secret.â  Then you get them with, âIâll show you mine if you show me yours,â and youâre in.  So they show you this elaborate handshake that if you were to actually do in the presence of other people, everyone in the room would know that they were witnessing a secret handshake.  âOh look.  Those two over there are doing a secret handshake.  No, not those two, their arm wrestling.  The two in back of them with the funny big red hats and golden sashes.â  And thatâs the thing about secret handshakes I find so confusing.  As secret as they are, they are anything but subtle.  I offer if you want to keep your handshake a secret keep the high fives to a minimum.  Do you think that maybe what we recognize as a regular handshake today was once the most brilliant secret handshake ever?  That would be a tragedy cause that was a really good one but someone got careless and taught it to the wrong person and they started shaking hands like a lunatic all over the world.  Then it got back to the original creator and they were like, âwhere did you learn this?â  They answer, in a British accent, âfrom the captain of the Zeppelin I traveled to your country in.â  You realize you donât know any Zeppelin captainâs, so its back to the handshake lab to add some knuckle twists, backhand slaps and half hugs.  One of my favorite hugs to witness but not participate in is the, âtwo-people-wearing-full-backpack-hug.â  I love this one because as important as arms are to a hug the back is right there too.  Without the back there is no where for the arms and hands to go and make that pat motion, which essentially completes the hug.  The two people over hug cause they canât feel it.  They just end up patting each otherâs possessions.  âWow you got a lot of stuff, that you canât be away from.â  âYou too.â  âWell OK, Iâm gonna go take some aspirin for my back.â  âSave me some.â  If you think hugs are on their way out youâre crazy.  Handshakes, secret or not will be gone way before the hug ever leaves us.  My proof is that you canât shake your own hand and not feel goofy.  A major flaw with the invention of the handshake.  You can try but the other hand just canât grip.  But with hugs you can be the only person left on Earth and you will still be able not only to give a hug, but receive on too.  And that my friends is, âsafe hugging.â
