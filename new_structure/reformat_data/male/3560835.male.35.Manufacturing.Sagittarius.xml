      I suppose I should come clean and say that I was once a â¦ wellâ¦ thereâs no polite way to say this.  I was onceâ¦ a liberal.   Or, I once  thought myself  to be a liberal.    And thereâs really nothing wrong with that, because some of the smartest people I know once thought themselves to be liberal.  There are a ton of clichÃ©s to describe the phenomenon:   A man who isnât a liberal at 20 has no heart, but a man whoâs still a liberal at 60 has no brain .   My favorite is the one about how a conservative is just a liberal whoâs been  mugged by reality .  I like the flavor of that one; I like what it implies about reality and what it implies about the survival ability of a conservative.  I think that considering yourself a liberal in your teens and twenties is pretty much inevitable in America.  And, really, thatâs fine.  Irresponsibility of all kids is typically tolerated by people who arenât really adults yet, and political irresponsibility is a lot more innocuous than drunk driving or the mismanagement of pregnancy and/or children.    Liberalism on the part of young people should especially be tolerated when you consider that young people today are hit over the head repeatedly with liberal dogma.        Liberalism seeps out of modern society in America like infection from a neglected wound.  Alright, Iâm sorry, I know thatâs disgusting, but I canât think of another phrase that better sums up my position on the topic.  Our culture, our media, our academic institutionsâ¦ theyâre all havens for liberal elitism.  It was just as bad during my childhood in the 80âs as it is today.  I remember the Animal Rights posters in the police station in the early  Lethal Weapon  movies.  (Yep, cops who had time to remind us all that fur, too, is murder.)  I remember the liberal spin on TV, where Alex P. Keaton was presented as the weirdo on  Family Ties  because he was conservative.  And rock music?  Forget about it.  Remember the degrading Ronald Reagan puppet in that Genesis video?  Remember REM, and how liberal they were even  before  they sucked?  Bring it forward into the 90âs and it seemed that a liberal agenda was a pre-req to get a recording contract.  And, boy, did those angry liberal lyrics really hit the spot for those of us with some leftover teen angst to burn.  Trust me on this one, this is coming from a guy with a Pearl Jam tattoo on his left shoulder.    The thing that made liberalism so appealing was the âus against themâ mindset.  Every teenage kid goes through that phase and the ones with half a brain are going to eventually start thinking about political and social issues.  The liberals have always done a good job of painting all conservatives as elderly, wealthy, bitter, asexual white men with big cigars and chauffeurs who drive them from the country club to the bank.  Thatâs an easy caricature to dislike, and it is hammered again and again into the heads of young people.  Liberals rely on that stereotype as an effective recruiting technique, and as far as theyâre concerned, all conservatives fit it.  Thatâs why so many conservatives who  donât  fit that stereotype, such as  urlLink Andrew Sullivan ,  urlLink J.C. Watts , and  urlLink Tammy Bruce , make liberals so uncomfortable.  They prove the stereotype wrong, they indicate the real diversity that exists under the conservative umbrella.  Liberals donât like that because they believe that they own the concept of diversity.  In fact, liberals approve of and champion diversity of every kind except one:  diversity of ideas.  As I got older and started to notice differences between my own ideas and the  stated  ideas of the people Iâd been surrounding myself with, I became acquainted with two wonderful concepts which, in a way, saved me.  Those concepts were doubt and introspection.    My awakening to my own conservative nature began when I started to doubt that my friends and peers were totally serious about some of the issues they were championing.  How serious could they be about hating their own race?  How could they be so anti-anything-corporate with a Coke in one hand and a CD released by Warner Brothers in the other?  And how much of the self-righteous liberal indignation I was feeling was real and how much of it was just a combination of laziness, immaturity, and my own sheep-like mentality?  This doubt and introspection hit me right about the same time we elected Bill Clinton and I saw what a liberal really  would  do in the White House.  I began realizing that I agreed with the conservatives around me a hell of a lot more than I did with the liberals around me.  I began realizing thatâ¦ well, whatta ya knowâ¦ my own ideas were less like Eddie Vedderâs and more like Ronald Reaganâs.  Iâve also come to the conclusion that, in order to cling to liberal beliefs into substantial adulthood, a person would have to be a master at denial.  He or sheâd have to avoid introspection at all costs and see any doubt about his or her ideas as the encroachment of the right wingâs continuous efforts to brainwash the masses.  In order to continue to see yourself as liberal, you have to tell yourself that liberalism  always  equals correctness and conservatism  always  equals closed-mindedness.    If you doubt it, try this little test:  Ask any real conservative you know what the best thing about Bill Clintonâs Presidency was.  He or she will probably think for a moment and then comment on how Clinton lowered the deficit or how he drifted from the left back to the mainstream and helped pass welfare reform.   The conservative will probably qualify that observation by noting that the good Clinton did was far outweighed by the bad, true enoughâ¦ but he or she will most likely have something good to say about Clinton.   Then, ask any real liberal you know what the best thing is about George W. Bushâs Presidency.   Donât be surprised when you are assured that thereâs  nothing  good about George W. Bush, that heâs evil and stupid, and that he must be stopped before he destroys the world.  That's the official, approved liberal stance on Bush, and any liberal is going to do his duty and parrot it mindlessly.   Thatâs the difference between a conservative and a liberal.  A conservative puts a lot of thought into his ideas and a liberal puts a lot of other peopleâs ideas into his thought.  So thereâs my confession.  Itâs probably not as scandalous as it could have been, so I hope it isnât a disappointment.  Maybe itâll help if I admit that I still enjoy those Pearl Jam albums.  Hell, I even still sing along.

      What's the first thing that comes into your mind when I say the following:       "American Farmer."        If you're like most people, you probably conjure up a mental image of the sun setting over a corn field.  Back over that field, in the distance, you might see an old but solid looking two-story farm house.  There, on the porch of that house, resting in the porch swing after sixteen hours of hard, back-breaking farm labor, you might imagine an old fella in bibbed overalls and a straw hat.  It's not hard to picture him using his work-callused hands to strum a guitar and sing a classic country song (maybe  "Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain" ) as he watches the sun go down behind all those acres of corn, thanking God for another healthy, productive day, and praying for just a little more rain before month's end.  It's not hard to like a guy like that.  Hell, I just now  made him up out of thin air  and I like him just fine.  I'd even join Willie Nelson and John Mellancamp in a little fund-raising hootinanny for a guy like that.  I'm sure those kinds of farmers exist.  Somewhere.  And I'm sure they're every bit as honorable and hard-working as we imagine they are.  But the truth is that the farmers that the federal government subsidizes... the ones that the feds give our tax money to, are often something else all together.  Sometimes they're millionaire basketball players, media barons, and even Enron executives.  Check out these  urlLink   figures that the Heritage Foundation unearthed , with a ca-ching ca-ching here and a ca-ching ca-ching there.

      Iâm going to give the liberals credit and assume that they donât mean to be cozying up to Michael Moore the way they are.  Iâll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that theyâre all drunk on their Bush-hatred and suffering from Clinton-withdraw and just arenât thinking clearly.  I canât help but imagine them all waking up on the first Wednesday in November, rolling over and seeing Michael Moore in bed with themâ¦ really  seeing  him for the first timeâ¦ and finally understanding why they were asked to leave early.   âDid we really spend the last six months dancing with THAT?â  theyâll ask themselves while crawling to the toilet.   Michael Moore is a documentary film makerâ¦ in the same sense that Hannibal Lecter is a gourmet chef:  heâs got the skills, but his concoctions are quite appalling once you realize whatâs actually  in  them.  Mooreâs  Bowling for Columbine   won the Best Documentary Oscar in 2003, despite the fact that it contained enough  urlLink propaganda, distortions, and outright fiction  to qualify more as a fantasy film than an actual documentary.  Mooreâs latest heaping helping is  Fahrenheit 9/11 , in which he attacks President Bush for having been asleep at the wheel prior to 9/11, having handled the crisis badly, and having lead the US into an unnecessary Iraqi war, all the while covering up his shady ties to a Saudi Arabian criminal element.  Disney, the filmâs potential distributor (as a parent company to Miramax, which funded the feature) backed away from the film upon arrival, and Mooreâs pals at Miramax made some hasty deals to get it distributed quickly, with hopes that  Fahrenheit 9/11  will undo the Bush presidency in November.  Coming out of the Cannes Film Festival with the Golden Palm award,  Fahrenheit 9/11  received an immediate golden shower of kisses from Americaâs film critics and left-leaning cultural icons.  Roger Ebert gave the film a big thumbs up on his television show, saying that Moore ârepresents my political views.â  Ebertâs partner, Richard Roeper, fawned all over the film as well.  The Rotten Tomatoes website shows that 81 percent of the film critics polled love the movie, which will be released on the 25th of this month.   Ebert predicts another Oscar.  Thereâs only one problem:   All advance reports indicate that  Fahrenheit 9/11  contains some of Mooreâs most elaborate fantasies yet.  Moore accuses the Bush administration of being soft on Saudi terrorists.  In fact, it was the Bush administration that named  urlLink thirteen Saudis  and a Lebanese for the bombing of Khobar Towers, home to hundreds of U.S. airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  That bombing killed 19 and wounded hundreds.  That bombing, by the way, happened on June 25th, 1996â¦ during Bill Clintonâs watch.  How did Clinton respond to the bombing?  By letting Saudi Arabia handle it, by never once pressuring to allow American investigators to interview the bombers once they were apprehended, and by smoothing over the whole incident for fear of angering his political supporters in Saudi Arabia.  Bush, the man Michael Moore aligns with Saudi terrorists, had the backbone to go after the specific Saudis involved on June 21, 2001 â five years after the bombing, and almost three months   before  9/11.        And what of Bushâs unnecessary war on Iraq?   Another liberty taken with international law by the commander in chief?  Hardly.  Anyone paying attention in the 1990s knows that Bush inherited the Iraqi problem from Clinton.  When the first President Bush left office, he left the world a Saddam Hussein with his hands tied as tightly as possible.  Forbidden to sell his oil and surrounded by U.N. Weapons Inspectors, Saddam had little opportunity to rebuild his arsenals and restate his threat.  However, over eight years of lax enforcement and a blind eye from the Clinton administration, Saddam grew stronger, more threatening, and cockier.  For eight years Saddam wiggled out of sanctions and limitations.  For eight years Saddam kicked out one Weapons Inspector after another, defying the world to do anything about it.  And how did Clinton respond?  With speeches and with the occasional bombing whenever he needed to distract us from his own missteps.  Never once did Clinton respond in a meaningful way.  Never once did he demand U.N. intervention, nor did he ever mobilize the American military to deal with the problem on the ground.  By 9/11, any reasonable person saw Saddam Hussein for what he was:  more of a threat than ever.  In a nutshell, President Bush the senior made a mighty effort to reign in the Iraqi madmanâ¦ President Clinton played the sax while the middle east burnedâ¦ and President Bush the junior got stuck cleaning up the mess.  And yet, somehow, Michael Moore has found a way to blame Dubya for the mess he inherited.  Only two Presidents have ever had the guts to use the military to contain Saddam Hussein, and both of them were named Bush.  Only two Presidents have had the guts to use the military to strike back at terrorists;  urlLink one was the late, great Ronald Reagan , and the other one was Dubya.  Iâd say that if the current President continues to conduct himself in ways befitting of these kinds of comparisons, he has little to worry about from a crackpot like Michael Moore.  As the summer wears on, Mooreâs statements get nuttier and nuttier.  He has said that heâd get  Fahrenheit 9/11  released even if he had to break the law to do it.  Heâs claimed that he has footage of an interview he conducted with Nick Berg, the American beheaded by terrorists in Iraq last month, but that he will keep it out of his film out of respect for the Berg family.  Maybe if he respected the Berg family all that much, heâd never have mentioned the footage of Nick in the first placeâ¦ but then again, a headline addict has to get his regular fix.  Not that any of this should be any surprise.  There is no limit to the depths to which Michael Moore will sink.  Check out what he posted on his website in April of this year:    "I oppose the U.N. or anyone else risking the lives of their citizens to extract us from our debacle. I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end."    As James Lileks  urlLink points out , thatâs essentially the same reason those terrorists gave for beheading Nick Berg in the first place.    Sober up, liberals.  Youâve got your arm around the ugliest dog at the party.

      Considering that I basically spend my days as an oral blog, forcing myself on an unwilling and uninterested audience, it seems to be high time that I finally began the innocuous process of actually blogging my thoughts on the internet.  Out here, in cyberspace, my ideas can't hurt anyone, right?  I mean, you don't have to read any of this, do you?  Of course you don't... but if you insist on continuing, I think it's only fair to tell you where I stand on all the fun issues.  This first post will lay the groundwork... I promise not to be this verbose in the future.    Election 2004:   John Kerry is a political opportunist.  Heâs guided exclusively by personal ambition and he lacks the character and backbone necessary to lead the nation.  A leftover Clinton sycophant,  Kerry is blind to the dramatic and lasting changes made to this nation by 9/11 and he is indifferent to the real concerns of most Americans.  Of the potential candidates the Democratic Party could have nominated as their Presidential candidate, only Howard Dean would have been a worse choice.  John Kerry is simply unfit to govern in any capacity.  George W. Bush isnât a perfect President and probably doesnât deserve quite as much praise as he receives from Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and the like.  I was a McCain supporter in 2000 and still believe that, in many ways, John McCain would have been a superior president to Bush.  Nonetheless, George W. Bush has impressed me with the way he stepped up to the challenges of 9/11 and his handling of post-Saddam Iraq.  Heâs clearly a superior choice to Kerry (and Ralph Nader), and I support President Bushâs campaign for re-election.    Politics In General:   The Democratic Party has failed.  It is, to paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut, disappearing up itâs own rear end.  There was a time when the Democratic Party had legitimate claim to a role as the party of the common man; a party that represented Americaâs labor forces, minorities, and disenfranchised people everywhere.  That time has passed.  Over the past fifty years, the nation has changed, and largely for the better.  Working conditions have improved to the point of relative ease compared to the sweat shops of old.  Opportunities for minorities and women are plentifulâ¦ in fact, no real resource or public position is available to one American that isnât available to all Americans.  Put simply, with few exceptions, America has reached the state of balance and fairness that may have seemed elusive 50 years ago.  In the absence of itâs old focus,  the Democratic Party has become motivated entirely by extremist political ideals and guided by principles that are more academic than practical.  A party once focused on racial equality is now a proponent of destructive quotas.  A party once concerned with the fair treatment of Americaâs labor forces is now aligned conspicuously with the leadership of the nationâs major labor unions.  Furthermore, that very leadership is now largely as corrupt and at odds with itâs membership as the worst corporate bosses.  Where there was once (ostensibly) a party guided by principle and morality, there is now a new Democratic Party.  A Democratic Party guided by political correctness, moral relativism, criminal justification, and outright ambivalence toward the real ideas and goals of the modern common man.  There is still a disenfranchised element in this country, but that element has been disenfranchised by the very Democratic Party that once championed it.  In contrast, the Republican Party typically offers viable, worthwhile candidates on the national, state, and even local levels.  Republican candidates arenât generally perfect, of courseâ¦ but the best and most reasonable leaders this country has produced in my lifetime have almost exclusively been Republicans.  I could write more about the Republicans, but my political leanings are probably evident, and further praise would be superfluous.  Iâm not a member of the GOP, or any political party, but I vote Republican more often than not and most of my personal heroes have been Republicans.    The Media:   I believe that this decade will come to be referred to as the âpost Network Newsâ age.  This is largely because of the alternative news sources available on cable and satellite TV and over the internet.  The big-three network news outfits (and their stepchild, CNN) have become so liberally biased that itâs difficult to take them seriously anymore.  Over the past couple of years, they seem to have abandoned any pretense of objectivity.  Consider professional wrestling, which seemingly overnight went from denying that itâs competitions were fraudulent to celebrating the pageantry of what they now call  âsports entertainment.â  Likewise, the big-three news networks seem to be basking in their own outward liberalism as of late.   Substituting editorial commentary for straight news reporting and calling it ânews analysisâ may be acceptable to people who turn to television purely for entertainment, but it isnât for those of us who would like to use the medium to stay informed.  Unfortunately, weâve now reached a state where we have to catch various spins on any given news story from various sources and decide for ourselves which version we agree with.  Straight news coverage is a thing of the past.    The Culture:   Iâll try to stay away from definitive phrases like âall time lowâ and âutterly bankrupt,â but I canât help but believe that, culturally, America is worse now than itâs been in my lifetime.  The popularity of reality TV (which has nothing to do with reality and should rightly be called  âunscripted smut TVâ ) is one indication of how low our standards have sunk.  Another is the popularity of rap music, with its lyrical boasts of rape and murder.  The worst thing about our current cultural state, however, has got to be our obsession with the cult of celebrity.  Itâs bad enough that we look to actors and singers for our cues on what trendy clothes to wear.  Must we now also look to them so weâll know which trendy diet to follow, which trendy religion to practice, and which trendy stance to take on any given political issue?  Why should we?  Why should the culture that gives us garbage like  Fear Factor ,  MTVâs Jackass , and that idiot that calls himself â50 Centâ presume to influence us on the things that really matter?  Ultimately, celebrities are nothing more than flashes of color and pulses of sound from our TVâs and stereos.  If Sean Penn, Sheryl Crow, and Woody Harrelson are fit to guide us, spiritually, culturally, or politicallyâ¦ then so is Bugs Bunny.    Social Issues:   As our country cast aside some of the old, flawed, impractical ideas of the past, weâve also cast aside ideas and practices that always served us well.  Weâve thrown out the baby with the bath water.  Weâve replaced racial discrimination in the business world with racial quotas, an equally destructive form of bigotry.  Quotas (and thatâs all Affirmative Action really is) still fail to examine the quality of a manâs character before judging his place by the color of his skin.   In addition, minority members are almost forced into a position of dependence on government programs by a governmental machine that justifies itâs own existence by insisting that minorities are incapable of self reliance.   The irony would make George Orwell proud:  The link between affirmative action, race, poverty and government programs is obviousâ¦ but anyone who dares suggest that government programs are part of the problem and not the solution is often labeled racist or worse.    Sexism has become an opposite but equally destructive version of itâs old self as well.  Whereas once women were limited to roles as home makers and mothers, we now live in a society that tells women who chose to dedicate themselves to the rearing of their children and the maintenance of their family that theyâve somehow betrayed themselves and their sex with their choices.  Women once werenât allowed to leave the home; now they are seemingly required to, whether they want to, or have to,  or not.      The Solution:   The solution, as I see it, is at once complex and basic.  Americans need a return to simplicity, reverence, and moderation in our personal lives and in our public institutions.    Weâve come to a place in this country where we justify anything that we want to do by proclaiming ourselves as warriors against oppression.  And weâre more than happy to imagine that oppression exists where it doesnât.  In fact, freeing oneself from some phantom oppression seems to be the hottest trend.    We donât know our wants from our needs anymore, and we reject any and all forms of self discipline as outdated and antiquated.    We congratulate ourselves on how enlightened weâve become, on how weâve thrown off the cultural limitations and closed mindedness of the 1950âsâ¦ not realizing that weâve also cast aside national security, individual accountability, personal standards, and the concepts of right and wrong.   A nation once guided by a reverent and  humble belief in God now rejects reverence and humility as concepts that keep us from reaching our personal potential and prevent us from truly enjoying ourselves.  In order to justify our hedonism, we tell ourselves that God is an outdated concept.  We sacrifice spirituality in order to pick at the imperfections of organized religion.  As we drift further and further from spiritual relationships (both with God and with one and other) we find ourselves increasingly dissatisfied with the hollow amenities of secular life.   In our denial, in our suffocating lack of God in our day to day lives, weâve turned into a nation of spoiled bratsâ¦ covering our ears, shutting our eyes, holding our breath, and telling ourselves that since we can't see it, it must not be there.   We must unlearn much of the garbage weâve learned over the past twenty or thirty years and we must re-embrace the standards of our grandfathers.  No, we   mustnât   re-embrace their faults.  We must not become, as we believe ourselves to have once been,  a nation of segregation, limited womenâs rights, or intolerance.   But we must reject the modern degradation of personal standards and individual accountability.  If your right eye offends you, pluck it out.  Iâm not suggesting literal self mutilation, but I am suggesting, adamantly, that watching no TV at all is better than watching  Fear Factor .  Listening to no radio at all is better than listening to Howard Stern.  They have the right to broadcast garbage, but we arenât required to participate.   And we arenât required to accept whatever the networks tell us about the news.  Remember that they are pushing an interpretation of events, not offering an objective report.  Each of us must investigate for himself or herself in order to have some idea what is really going on in the world around us.  We must hold ourselves accountableâ¦ not just for our actions but for our futures.    Donât believe the hype.  Donât buy the lies.  And  for Godâs sake , donât let Madonna tell you what to think about God, Iraq, cheeseburgers, or anything else.

      Am I correct in my belief, based on what I see and hear, that many minorities in this country define themselves culturally by their reactions to and relationships with white males?    Or is it simply that the modern defenders of minorities protect their positions of influence by constantly railing against white racism?  Do these self-appointed saints justify themselves by trying to convince minorities that they are all that stands between non-whites and a return to oppression?  Iâm not asking rhetorically.  Not entirely, anyway.  The truth is, I simply donât know for sure.  But I have some ideas.  As a white male (a white southern male at that) I often wonder how Iâm perceived by the black people who know me.  Do they judge me based on my character or do they prejudge me based on the color of my skin and my sex?  Are their interactions with me genuine or do they handle me with kid-gloves?  The non-whites I know probably wonder the same things about me.  In this day and age, thatâs probably natural.  Race relations in this country simply aren't where they ought to be.  White racism certainly isnât dead, but itâs no longer a politically viable threat to minorities.  White racism is a dirty little secret, kept alive by a smaller and smaller percentage of whites who are small-minded, xenophobic, and lack self confidence.   If youâre white, you know the people Iâm talking about.  You may work with them, live with them, or be related to them.  These are the people who canât wait to make a racist remark as soon as a black person leaves the room.  These are the people who expect complicity out of all of us who happen to be white like them.  Put simply, theyâre morons.  Their racism reveals their stupidity, and so does  most  of what they say and do.  Theyâre pitiful, but itâs hard to pity them because theyâre so damned repellant.  Theyâre small, theyâre usually old, and theyâre weak.  They are the dying remnants of bad habits.  They are all that remains of white racism today.  So it bothers me that white racism is still seen as this ever-present, powerful, universally destructive force.  It bothers me because, for the most part, the myth of all-powerful white racism is kept alive by white liberals.    White liberals are probably the biggest betrayer of the civil rights movement today.  It hasnât always been that way, of course.  Liberals were the first whites to recognize the importance and the value of the civil rights movement in itâs infancy.  Liberals embraced and welcomed the changes asked for and demanded by men like Martin Luther King, and gradually those changes were won by the minority members who fought hard for them.  Along the way, white liberals won the friendship of blacks by proving to them that they werenât like the powerful, racist whites who wanted to keep America divided.  As those powerful, racist whites fell from power and died off, the country changed.  White liberals didnât change at all, though.  Today we live in a society where black people have all the rights and privileges of white people.  A society where white racism is seen for what it is; weak and stupid.  Todayâs America is an even playing field and white racism is under the watchful eye of the government, the culture, and the media.  Itâs a dying snake in itâs death throes, itâs head chopped off long ago.  Nonetheless, white liberals, in their typical short sightedness, havenât changed their position one bit.  In a world full of black executives, black congressmen and senators, black celebrities and councilors and doctors and writers, white liberals still preach that white racism is the worldâs biggest threat and that they are the only true friend that the black man has.      Bill Cosbyâs remarks at the 50th anniversary celebration marking Brown v. the Board of Education delighted me to no end.  Iâll admit that right out front.   I believe, and have believed for some time now, that personal accountability is a dead issue in todayâs society.  So for Bill Cosby to hold each poor black person accountable for his or her own actions seemed like a rare moment of common sense in a society dominated by white liberals and their claims that the white male is responsible for all the evil in the world.  Of course, the crap hit the fan following Cosbyâs remarks, and it was thrown from all directions.  Writing for the Washington Post, the NAACPâs Theodore M. Shaw agreed with Cosby that people are accountable for their actions, but pointed to two different brutal murders of blacks as evidence that white racism is  urlLink still a major oppressor .  Of course, those arguments could be balanced with evidence of black-on-black crime, but in the end, neither side of that argument accomplishes anything.  In a piece for Knight Ridder, Alvin Williams of  urlLink Black Americaâs Political Action Committee  expressed hope that Cosbyâs skills at selling Coke and Jello Pudding would help sell the notion of responsible behavior to poor blacks.  I hope so, too.  God knows that there are plenty of people trying to sell horrible ideas to poor blacks.  Consider John McWhorterâs  urlLink  indictment of gangsta rap  as more than just culturally vacuous, but also terribly destructive.  Of course Cosby didnât say that white racism no longer exists.  I believe that a form of it still does, and that it is a bigger threat to blacks than ever, because it has camouflaged itself in liberalism.  White liberals teach poor blacks that they arenât capable of making their own way in life, that they need to rely on social programs for as long as possible, and that those programs simply donât do enough for the poor blacks who depend on them.  White liberals also teach poor blacks that they canât find their own place in the business world or in colleges based on their own merit, and that they can only succeed if whites make an exception and allow them in simply because they are black.  White liberals call this affirmative action.  Conservatives call it quotas.  No matter what you call it, it boils down to racism.  By offering blacks a hand up, white liberals are asking blacks to acknowledge that they are below them.  Maybe whites should rally around Cosby.  Not to defend his remarks, they don't need defending.  Rather, to use him as a catalyst to call our own subversive elements to task.  Let's start with the same scum balls that Cosby pointed out.  Petty thieves, killers, and low-lifes must be held accountable for their actions, and that goes for low-lifes with white skin, black skin, Latinos, what have you.  Let's not stop there, though.  Let's hold white liberals accountable for their actions, too.  For too long now, they've stood with arms outstretched between minorities and the rest of the white population.  For too long they've kept us apart.  We shouldn't stand for it any longer.  America is too great a nation to be split in half by the paranoia and self-aggrandizing of a few whites with an axe to grind.  Brown v. the Board of Education was 50 years ago, and that isnât that long a period of time.  We are still blessed today with the presence of black people who are old enough to remember real segregation, real racism, real oppression.  It is incumbent upon all of us that we learn from their experiences, and that we make their work and sacrifices worth while.  The way to do that is by working together, not separately.  By being inclusive, not divisive.  By having open and frank dialogue, not by encouraging a one-sided exchange wherein people of a certain race are encouraged to speak their minds and people of another are discouraged from speaking at all.  America can become colorblind.  We can get there by judging each other by the content of our characters and not by the color of our skin.  Thanks to white liberals, Martin Luther Kingâs dream is as far out of reach today as it ever was.

      Bill Clinton kicked off his book tour to promote   My Life   (a tome that, by all accounts, reads like a phonebook in Sanskrit) by talking about his Presidential nicknames on  urlLink  60 Minutes  with Dan Rather .  In the 90âs, Clintonâs nicknames piled up almost as fast as his indiscretions.   There was âThe Comeback Kid,â and âBubbaâ and âElvis,â and, my favorite, âSlick Willie.â  Clinton says that âSlick Willieâ is the only one that still makes him bristle.  Apparently heâs fine with the others.     I thought that âSlick Willieâ fit him just fine.  âBubbaâ was assigned to him because he was ostensibly a southerner, but I know a few Bubbas who would bristle if they heard their appellation applied to Bill Clinton.  I never understood why anyone would call Clinton âElvis,â though.  I always thought him more similar to another long-dead rock starâ¦ Jim Morrison.  Like the lead singer of The Doors, Clinton made a career out of style without substance.  He was a master at using words that sound good but really mean nothing, and he sure could strike a pose.  Like Morrison, Clinton lived hedonistically and insisted that those who had a problem with his lifestyle were, in fact, the ones with the problem.  Just like Jim Morrison, Clinton BSâd his way to his position in life and then didnât know what to do with it once he got it.  He preened and pouted and smiled for the cameras and ultimately accomplished little of substance.  Like Morrison, Bill Clintonâs legacy has more to do with star power than with talent, guts, or value.  If Jim Morrison was, as he named himself,  âThe Lizard King,â  then Bill Clinton must be  âThe Lizard President.â   Itâs hard to be objective about Clinton when his choice of words and his presentation and his body language make it so obvious how impressed he is with himself.  Regardless of the disasters he left behind in Washington, Clinton genuinely thinks of himself as a revolutionary, a visionary, and a smashing success.  Even his self-acknowledged failures smack of hubris.  Clinton confessed to Dan Rather that his failure to bring peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis was his biggest failure,  âan error of historic proportions,â  as he called it.  Am I the only person left aghast at such a simplified, meaningless confession?  Honestly, does Clinton think that it would have been possible in eight years to have brought a real and lasting peace to the Middle East?  What might he have done during his two term presidency that would have been so different from everyone before him who has worked to stabilize that hottest of world hot spots?  Could he, in his monumental wisdom and progressive world view, actually have accomplished in two terms whatâs seemed impossible for thousands of years?  He seems to think he could have, and names his failure to do so as his biggest mistake.  He may as well chastise himself for not controlling the weather.  To point to the continued unrest between Arabs and Jews as his biggest failure is to name no real failure at all.  This is shocking, considering the list of failures he had to pick from:    Osama bin Laden   Clinton claims to have been  urlLink âobsessedâ with Osama bin Laden  during his Presidency.  Well, thereâs obsession, and then thereâs Bill Clintonâs obsession.   Iâll give Slick the benefit of the doubt and assume that bin Laden did cross his mind from time to timeâ¦ but not because he was concerned in any meaningful way about the threat of terrorism.  If he had been, maybe Clinton would have used the military to capture bin Laden instead of relying on overwhelmed police agencies.  Maybe heâd have recognized the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as an act of war and not as an isolated crime.  If Clinton had possessed even half the resolve and determination of George W. Bush, perhaps heâd have been obsessed with actually  capturing  the Saudi terrorist.  Instead, Clintonâs âobsession,â such as it was, had more to do with his fear of whatever stain bin Laden might leave on Clintonâs dreamt of legacy.    Iraq   Another Clinton failure, another mess left for his successor to clean up, was Saddam Hussein.  For eight years, Bill Clinton did nothing real to stop the Iraqi dictatorâs return to threatening power.  The sanctions imposed on Saddamâs regime after the first Gulf War were largely ignored in the 90âs, as Clinton gradually caved in to  urlLink Russian, Chinese, and French  pressure.  Gradually, Iraq returned unhindered to the world marketplace as Clinton resulted to  urlLink doomed policies of appeasment .  Saddam repeatedly  urlLink threw out weapons inspectors  in the name of national sovereignty.  He also used his starving people as pawns to pressure the world to allow him, practically unchecked, to resume his oil trade.  Money began to flow through Saddamâs regime again and he began to rearm, becoming an increasingly bold and dangerous law-breaker.  Faced with this threat, Clinton  urlLink made a few speeches and dropped a few bombs  as punishment.  Saddam weathered that punishment, having called Clintonâs bluff and knowing full well that the American President wouldnât lift a finger to actually stop him from rearming.  By the beginning of George W. Bushâs Presidency, Saddam was bolder and more threatening than ever, having spent eight years enjoying the freedom of Bill Clintonâs failure.    North Korea   What of Clintonâs failures in North Korea?  Clinton now says he was  âdeterminedâ  not to let North Korea become a nuclear power.  So, why did he let them, then?  In 1994, the U.S. inked a deal with North Korea wherein weâd provide them with food and fuel and theyâd start living up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty theyâd previously signed.  During Clintonâs second four years in office, North Korea developed the nuclear capabilities theyâd promised not to.  We continued to live up to our end of the deal, anyway.  And whatâs worse, believable sources indicated that  urlLink Clinton knew that the North Koreans were cheating  and never moved to call them on it.  By then, the rock star President was already dreaming about the way heâd be remembered, content to leave North Korea to his successor as well.    The Fund Raising Scandal   What about Clintonâs shady relationships with  urlLink questionable foreign campaign donors ?   Might that be his biggest failure?  Could he have left a black mark on the Presidency with his actions?  Nope.  Clinton didnât even address that issue during his  60 Minutes  interview.  I suppose he considered that issue to be moot... after all, he'd  urlLink  already condemned foreign campaign contributions .  Of course, he condemned it  urlLink after the fact , and it was his buddy  urlLink John Huang  who got stuck twisting in the wind... but, hey,  urlLink who's counting ?    Impeachment   Maybe his impeachment represented his biggest failure?  Not a chance.  While some of us remember that period as a dark, embarrassing time for our country, Clinton calls it a  urlLink  âbadge of honorâ  .  Heâs actually proud of it.  The whole scandal proved him to be a liar, a cheater, and a perverse abuser of the public trust.  And yet he sees it as his victorious battle against political forces that aimed to bring him down unjustly.  I suppose Jim Morrison felt the same way about the cops who arrested him for exposing himself during a Doors concert in Miami.  Fight the power, man.  Right on.        Monica-gate   Even the way Clinton seduced and clumsily bought off Monica Lewinski  urlLink failed to elicit any real shame  from the former President.  If thereâs any element of Clintonâs presidency that welcomes comparisons to Jim Morrison, it has to be Monica-gate.  Itâs hard not to draw parallels between the White House intern and a star-struck groupie, dazed and amazed to have a private audience with the Big Star as he sings  âCome on, come on, come on, TOUCH me babeâ¦â    Dan Rather gave Clinton several opportunities to call  the scandal his biggest failure in office.  Instead, Clinton told of his sleepless night before confessing his affair to his wife.  What are we to make of that?  Are we to take in this striking image of a man tortured by his own misdeeds?  Oh, my.  How brave.  How remarkable.  How totally irrelevant.  Clinton lost a night of sleep over the affair.  Big deal.  Show me a man who cheats on his wife and doesnât lose sleep over it.  Frankly, Iâm not remotely impressed by Clintonâs candor that the affair was a  âmoral error.â   Instead, let me draw your attention to his explanation that he had the affair  âfor the worst possible reason, because I could.â   Only Bill Clintonâ¦ and perhaps, Jim Morrisonâ¦ could make a statement that comes off simultaneously as self-effacing in structure and self-congratulatory in tone.  Clinton success in office, as I see it, is limited to one single item:  his work on the federal deficit.  Other than that, he was an abysmal failure.  Those who credit him for the fairly robust economy the country enjoyed in the â90âs fail to consider the internet stock boom.  And that had little, if anything, to do with Clinton.  (By the way, when those stocks fizzled, the recession they created had nothing to do with George W. Bush.)   Clintonâs foreign policies were inept and tragically flawed.  Through inaction he strengthened global terrorism and emboldened rogue nations.  And his shady back-room fundraising and  urlLink last minute pardons  for criminal friends rubbed the last bit of salt in the wounds. Clintonâs moral ambiguity and legal smarminess define his character, and his character defines his presidency.   For all his grand posturing as a visionary and a leader, Clinton was little more than a handsome face with a lot of style and nothing to say.  Like Jim Morrison before him, Clinton managed to trick a nation into believing that his indulgences and ramblings were meaningful.  He was the lizard President, and he could do anything.

      John Kerry attacked President Bush last week with regard to Bushâs stance on stem cell research.  Kerry accused the President of  urlLink putting ideology before science , and the subtext was clear.  See, John Kerry is a Catholicâ¦ heâs just  urlLink not  too  Catholic .  Oh, heâs Catholic enough to court the Catholic vote, but not Catholic enough to offend his progressive, forward-thinking, 21st century friends on the left.  John Kerryâs Catholicism is of the dashing, romantic  John Kennedy  varietyâ¦ not the old fashioned, strict  John Paul  variety.  For George W. Bush, faith is a matter of reverence.  For Kerry, itâs a matter of convenience.  Kerryâs comment is just the latest in the leftâs ceaseless attacks on reverence.  Hidden in a speech about science, camouflaged as campaign rhetoric, Kerryâs missive called Bush by name, but it was targeted at anyone who shares the Presidentâs reverent ideas about God.  You see, the left wing in this country outgrew that type of reverence long ago.  Theyâve replaced the antiquated, spiritual idea of reverence with modern, human ideas.  The left is all for peace, love, and tolerance.  But reverence, a concept that encompasses and eclipses all these ideas, is rejected outright by todayâs liberals.  I supposed I should offer a definition of what I mean by reverence.  Reverence, as I see it, is really a combination of two things.  First, it is the belief that man was created, knowingly and intentionally, by an active, present, loving and omnipotent God.  Secondly, reverence is the behavior inherent in holding that belief.  Iâm talking about behavior born of the humility, compassion, and respect felt by those who are  reverent.  If you see yourself and everyone around you as an equal creation of God, it tempers your behavior.  It makes you unwilling to harm other people because you see them as the property of your creator, just as you are yourself.  It makes you patient and forgiving.  It makes you thirst for justice.  Reverence makes you look for the good around you rather than the bad.  It doesnât make you perfect, it neither discounts nor eternally prevents your trespassesâ¦ but reverence promotes far more positive behavior than does the belief that man is his own ultimate authority.      Any moral code worth following and strong enough to last is built on a belief in right and wrong as defined by the Creator of the Universe.  A code like that is inherent, it doesnât have to be taught, and it is assumed as the norm by everyone who follows it.  Itâs what  urlLink C.S. Lewis called ânatural law.â   That kind of code is far more effective and constructive than any law based entirely on the values of man.  For one thing, manâs values change.  What is considered intolerable today might be acceptable tomorrow.  Beyond that, manâs values are subjective.  You and I might agree, for instance, that stealing is wrong, but we might disagree about whether or not an MP3 downloader is stealing.  Ultimately, though, manâs laws are fallible because man is corruptible.  Men can be persuaded to make and support laws for selfish reasons or based on temporary situations.  Godâs laws, natural laws, are not corruptible.  Sure, a man can persuade himself that it is in his best interest that he behave in a way he knows to be wrong.  He might even persuade himself that it is good that he does soâ¦ but the mere fact that such an act of self persuasion is necessary proves the rule.  Manâs values change.  Godâs do not.  We are becoming less and less reverent and we are suffering for it.  Because we donât see each other as interactive parts of a system controlled by God, we hold ourselves to lower standards.  We are increasingly cruel and disrespectful to each other and even to ourselves.  We donât see ourselves as creations endowed with a life we owe to our Creator, so we take our own lives for granted and treat them irreverently.  It is acceptable in an irreverent society to abuse oneself with all mater of toxins, practices, and overindulgences.  Donât get me wrong, Iâm not pointing a finger at everyone else from a pious soapbox.  Iâm as guilty as anyone I know.  âIndulgenceâ might as well be my middle name.  So what is the solution?  I bet youâre expecting me to steer this little tirade toward an endorsement of one organized religion or another, arenât you?  Well, surprise.  I have no intentions of doing so.  Religion is not the same thing as reverence.  In fact, itâs often the exact opposite of reverence.  It is possible to keep the letter of Godâs law and break the heart of it.  And because religions are man-made systems, theyâre completely corruptible.  Itâs possible to obsess on the law and to pervert it.  Itâs possible to ritualize the laws of God, to personalize them and rob them of real meaning.  It is, in fact, possible to be more religious than God is.  All you need to do is have more laws than He does.  Or, to turn his natural laws into your own subjective ones.  Hereâs an example from my own observations:  I am constantly amazed and bewildered by the people who believe that all you have to do to keep the second commandment, the one about not taking the Lordâs name in vain,  is to avoid using the curse word that is commonly abbreviated G.D.  Thatâs laughable.  Of all the actions and ideas mankind is capable of, God only felt that ten of them were worth His divine commentary and direction.  Ten!  Do you for one second believe that one of only ten commandments amounts to  âDonât use this curse word, I donât like it.â   Come on, people.  Weâre talking about  GOD , not prim and proper aunt Martha.  Surely God cares more about context and meaning than syllables.  Could it be that using Godâs name in  vain amounts to more than your choice of expletive when you drop something heavy on your toe?   Certain Moslems behead hostages in Godâs name.  Certain Christians bomb clinics in Godâs name.  Certain others merely rail against Harry Potter and rock music in Godâs name.  All of them are acting in vain.   And all of them are very religious.  They just arenât very reverent.  For what itâs worth, I agree with John Kerry that George W. Bush puts ideology ahead of science.  Unlike Kerry, though, I think thatâs a good thing.  I think that Bush would rather be reverent than President.  Kerry, on the other hand, would rather be President than anything else.  Thatâs a terrible example to lead by in this day and age.    Consider Columbine.  Consider Enron.  Consider Abu Ghraib.  Stay the course, Mr. President.  We need all the ideology we can get.

      There's just no reason for me to post to this blog daily.  None at all.  If I did, my posts would amount to little more than items cribbed from the blogs I read daily.  For instance:  Andrew Sullivan drew my attention to  urlLink William Kristol's  wonderful  piece  about the Iraqi/al Qaeda link in the Weekly Standard.  Sullivan also mentioned that James Lileks had taken a  urlLink look at Rex Reed's critique of  Fahrenheit 9/11  .  James Lileks is by far my favorite columnist, and his comments about Reed's review had me alternatingly in stitches and seeing red.  Speaking of red, if you're pressed for time, scroll down Lileks page to the red text to read the comments about Rex Reed.  Arthur Chrenkoff is, as usual, indispensable.  At this point, if I don't read him daily, I feel conspicuously uninformed.  Among other things, today he mentioned Nicolas Rothwell's fascinating  urlLink report from Iraq  in  The Australian .  At Instapundit.com, I found out about a Robert Tagorda item that makes Bill Clinton look good in the only way possible:   urlLink by comparing him to Al Gore .  Honestly, if you're reading my blog and you've not read Sullivan, Chrenkoff, or Instapundit first, you're wasting time.  Think of my blog as an amateurâs op-ed column.  Think of  urlLink Sullivan ,  urlLink  Chrenkoff , and  urlLink Instapundit  ( urlLink and a host of other blogs ) as essential.

          Michael Mooreâs  Fahrenheit 9/11  opened in theaters on Friday.  In my area itâs showing on one of about 40 available screens.  The small, locally owned, âindieâ theater opted to show the film, and according to a newspaper article, has been getting harassing e-mail and phone calls over it.  I disapprove of that kind of harassment even more than I disapprove of Michael Moore.  My opinion is that Moore will likely damage his career with this film, maybe even destroy it, and we should let him.  These days, half or maybe most of the success of a movie is judged by itâs DVD shelf life.  Who will be interested in  Fahrenheit 9/11  after the election?  No one.  Thatâs bound to shape the way the studios view Michael Moore with regard to financial viability.  You canât swing a dead cat without hitting a positive review of the film.  Who didnât see that coming?  Movie reviewers, the bastard children of the liberal media and the far-left in Hollywood, seem to start frantically salivating at the mere mention of Michael Moore.  There are, however, a few negative reviews out there, and itâs my pleasure to bring you some highlights:     urlLink James Berardinelli for  ReelViews   "There are a series of interviews with Lila Lipscomb, whose son (Michael) died in Iraq. Moore first films her when Michael is still alive, and she's a staunch patriot. Later, he returns so she can recount how her son died. She reads the final letter he sent to her, and makes a cathartic trek to Washington D.C. to see the White House and curse the man living inside. It's poignant material, but Moore's reputation robs this portion of his film of its potential power. Because we don't know how much of this is real."     urlLink David Poland of  The Hot Button   "Moore, The Liberal Most Likely to make the argument with wit and insight and facts that may border on falsehood but which compel nonetheless, has come up with little more than a recruiting film for people who are still bitter about the election of 2000."     urlLink Todd McCarthy for  Variety   (Registration Required) "The sporadically effective docu trades far more in emotional appeals than in systematically building an evidence-filled case against the president and his circle."     urlLink Michael Sragow for the  Baltimore Sun   "This movie doesn't sustain a single tone or argument. All that unifies Fahrenheit 9/11 is contempt for the Bush administration...(The movie contains)one of Moore's abrasive man-in-the-street stunts: accosting congressmen and trying to persuade them to get their kids to volunteer for the Iraq war. (Only one congressman has a child fighting in Iraq.) Moore confronts (among others) Mark Kennedy, a Minnesota Republican, who in reality declared that he'd be happy to cajole his colleagues, 'especially those who voted for the war,' then noted, 'I have a nephew on his way to Afghanistan.' In the movie, all we see is Kennedy reacting to Moore's offer with a bizarre look of disbelief."     urlLink Lou Lumenick in the  New York Post   "Michael Moore's much-hyped and very heavy-handed polemic against George W. Bush, is basically a two-hour argument for regime change that isn't half as incendiary or persuasive as its maker would have you believe."     urlLink Fred Topel at  About.com   "Moore has resorted to showing us stuff that  The Daily Show  covers all the time...Then it degenerates into shameless pathos...Regardless of politics, this is not effective filmmaking. Talking heads and existing video footage arenât all that compelling... Sadly, what is most evident from  Fahrenheit 9/11  is that Michael Moore now believes his own hype. He thinks he can just say shocking things, show people suffering and heâll make his point. Maybe he will get his message out to more people than ever, thanks to the controversy heâs generated since  Bowling for Columbine  and his Oscar speech. Right now it seems like heâs only preaching to the choir. Most of Hollywood is politically liberal, and so far itâs only been Hollywood whoâs embraced the film. "     urlLink Joe Morgenstern at the  Wall Street Journal   (Registration Required) "( Fahrenheit 9/11  is) a postmodern, postliterary piece of agitprop, coming at a time when truth is often the first victim in supermarket tabloids, radio talk shows, campaign commercials on network TV and gabble-fests on cable."       And, finally, if you're curious about why the movie received the R rating, be sure and check out the  urlLink ScreenIt.com  account of the blood, gore, and violence in the movie.  And all of it is real, not special effects, remember that.  And remember that Moore fought to have the film re-rated PG-13.  Obviously, Michael Moore is dealing with a lot of emotional issues and personal demons... but why on earth would he want children to see such a movie?  The man must be driven by an awful cruelty.

      What did insomniacs do before the internet?  I have vague memories of long summer nights and   Twilight Zone  reruns and dog-eared book pages and cigarettes smoked on my front porch in the cool 4 am air.    Thank God all  that's  behind me now!  Now, I can stay up in front of the computer and while away the hours ruining my eyes and reading items like the following:  Ozzy Osbourne and the rest of Black Sabbath have gotten into the whole  urlLink  "Bush is Hitler!"   thing.  Typically, I brush this kind of thing off... but then again, these guys are old enough to  remember  Hitler...  The Who's  urlLink Pete Townsend  doesn't count himself among Michael Moore's fans.  By the way, Gary Trudeau has been  urlLink making fun  of the commander in chief for a lot longer than I realized.   urlLink Linda Chavez  has some more details about the Democrats Radio City Music Hall fundraiser.  It ain't pretty.   urlLink John Armor  is disgusted with the whole mess, too.  Bob Dole is my living hero, so I tend to experience some degree of butt-pucker when I get the idea that someone is going to trash him.  Thankfully, that's not what Jonah Goldberg is doing in his  urlLink National Review  article that finds common ground between Dole and Kerry.  Click  urlLink here  for the Intellectual Conservative's powerful refutation of the John Edwards Liberal Populist myth.       Have you ever seen anything creepier than the picture to the left?  I look at it and hear John Kerry speaking with Clark Gable's voice:   "Edwards, you must be kissed, and often, by a man who knows how."   Thanks, Rush, for a picture that will haunt my nightmares (assuming I ever get back to sleep) and some interesting observations about  urlLink Martha Stewart and the Johns.   My fellow bloggers over at  urlLink  Homespun  gave me lots to read, too...  It does all of us good to occasionally reaffirm two of life's certainties:  One, Spike  Lee is an asshole... and, two, country music can be pretty goofy.  Thank you, HipperCritical, for killing those  urlLink two birds with one stone.   If that picture of John Edwards with Kerry above wasn't enough to creep you out, check out what  urlLink Marcland   turned up:     Edwards worked an ostensibly less ridiculous seam: suing doctors and hospitals when babies were born with brain defects. He made his name with a 1985 cerebral palsy case, where he channelled the words of the unborn child as she waited in the womb, hour after hour.  "She said at 3, 'I'm fine.' She said at 4, 'I'm having a little trouble, but I'm doing OK.' Five, she said, 'I'm having problems.' At 5.30, she said, 'I need out'," Edwards told his hushed jury. "She speaks to you through me. And I have to tell you right now - I didn't plan to talk about this - right now I feel her. I feel her presence. She's inside me."      The whole sorted spirit-channeling mess is in  urlLink Mark Steyn's profile  of Edwards.  Speaking of creepy... if Hillary wasn't creepy enough on her own,  urlLink Weapons of Mass Distraction  found a scenereo that has me  urlLink flashing back to the old   V   miniseries .  The little engine that lied:  The Therapy Sessions reminds us that John Kerry clearly believes that if you repeat it enough, it becomes a fact... urlLink  I think it's true, I think it's true, I think it's true...    Check out  urlLink The Commons  For a good  urlLink Jack Kemp article .  By the way, the top banner at The Commons is one of the coolest I've seen.  It serves as a good reminder for those who need one.  Revenge of the hamster reminds the French that  urlLink instant karma's gonna getcha .   urlLink Spectra  directed me to David Kopel shooting holes in  urlLink  F911    I found some  urlLink ramblings  and found myself nodding in agreement a lot with the Souther Thide of Singz.  And with that, I'm off to bed... If I can just get my index finger to stop impetuously left-clicking.

      The Federal Marriage Amendment is dead in the Senate, and I for one hope itâs dead altogether.  Itâs brought out the worst in all of us.  Iâll say up front that Iâm a stateâs rights kind of guy and my opposition to FMA is rooted in my desire to protect the rights of my state and not in my feelings about gay marriage one way or the other.  I oppose any proposed Constitutional amendment that strikes me as superfluousâ¦ even if I agree, philosophically, with the proposed amendment.  For instance, I was in opposition to the proposed Constitutional amendment that would have outlawed flag burning.  Nonetheless, I would like to see my state make it legal to hold down flag burners, give them wedgies, and break all their Rage Against The Machine CDs.  You see where Iâm going with this.  So Iâm disappointed in my fellow conservatives who have backed the proposed amendment.   Theyâve behaved like liberals, to my way of thinking.  Remember, conservatives, we believe in less government meddling.  Not more.  We realize that law doesnât change who people are.  At best, law might influence peopleâs behavior.  At least it defines their behavior, with regard to whether or not a given behavior is a crime.  At heart, FMA seemed to be an effort on the part of some of my fellow conservatives to federally frown at homosexuality.  If you want to frown at homosexuality, go aheadâ¦ just donât tell me that Iâm federally required to.  Iâll make that decision for myself, thanks.  Not that the liberals are off the hook, here.  FMA has brought to the surface some of the nastiest, most resentful conservative-baiting and Bush-bashing yet.   Cheryl Jacques of the Human Rights Campaign said that, by supporting the amendment, Bush was trying to  urlLink âdrag this country through a cultural war to jumpstart a failing campaign.â   The National Organization of Women issued a statement  urlLink condemning âconservative religiousâ views  and even calling for the repeal of the mainstream 1996 Defense of Marriage act.  Are there any liberals balanced enough to consider that maybe some conservatives were capable of serious, reflective thought about the issue?  Isn't it possible that some of us conservatives... maybe even some of us Christian (gasp!) Conservatives... have done a lot of soul searching about it?  Heck, there may even be a few of us who oppose the amendment on ethical grounds!  But go ahead, presume that we only come out of our caves long enough to offer blood sacrifices to our  God  and throw rocks at gays.  Oh, and John Kerry, in a fence straddling act that would make Clinton weep, vocally opposed the amendment but  urlLink didnât bother to vote against it .  I can hear him now:  "Now, wait just a minute, I never actually voted against that amendment that I was opposed to."  Iâm not particularly happy with the way the President has handled this issue, either.  Heâs entitled his opinion, but doesnât he have bigger things on his plate?  I donât know that he benefited by making himself such a prominent spokesperson for this issue.      Oh, and if you didnât notice, many of the vocal elements in the gay community have  urlLink behaved horribly, too .  And their motives were entirely political.  Take notice, gay people:  The extreme left gay groups are only your friends  urlLink if you agree with their entire agenda .   They will sacrifice your privacy as quickly as they say the Patriot Act does if you arenât totally on board.  But this is no surprise.  These groups have always been motivated more by politics than principles.   Consider the hell they raised about Eminemâs idiotic, homophobic lyrics.  You donât think Eminem was the first rapper to bash gays in his songs, do you?  Aahhh, but he WAS the first WHITE oneâ¦  Look, if the people of Massachusetts want to make it legal for gays and lesbians to marry, thatâs fine with me.  Knock yourself out, Massachusetts.  Make it legal to marry squirrels and microwave ovens, for all I care.  To be blunt, I just donât give a damn what goes on in Massachusetts.  That state may as well be another planet.  I donât say that because of Massachusetts marriage laws.  I say that because the people there keep sending  urlLink space  urlLink  aliens  to represent them in the Senate.  Having said that, I must also say that I support my stateâs right to say that âround these parts, marriage is an exclusively heterosexual affairâ¦ and if you donât like that, itâs all interstate between here and Massachusetts.  That is, if thatâs what my state chooses to say.  And that remains to be seen.    And if youâre wondering where I personally stand on the issueâ¦ hell, Iâll tell you the truth.  I havenât thought about it.   I will say that I am opposed to   me personally   marrying a gay person of either sex, since I'm not gay.... but maybe Iâve missed the point.  Iâve been distracted.  Thereâs a lot going on over seas.

           Why doesn't the Bush Administration do a better job of getting information like the following out there this concisely? The John McCain ad was fine, and the ad that shot holes in Kerry's preposterous book was fine, too... but I wish more people were privy to this kind of realty check:    Click here for a great  urlLink unofficial Bush campaign ad .    And thanks to  urlLink  Liberal Utopia  for the heads-up on this one.  ________________________  Oh, yeah... I've thrown in with the lot at  urlLink Homespun Bloggers ...

      My girlfriend and I had one of our rare evenings when each of our kids were with their respective other parents, so we decided to go to the movies.  We saw  Super Size Me  at the local art-house theater, the same one that happened to be showing  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Well, I have to report that the crowd that Michael Mooreâs film drew to the theater was huge.  Easily the biggest crowd Iâve ever seen at this particular little indie theater.  We were amazed at the number of people filing out as one showing of  F911  ended and we were amazed at the number of people lining up to see the next showing.         I comforted myself by reminding myself that,  A)  ticket sales donât equal votesâ¦  B)  seeing a movie and agreeing with itâs point of view are two different thingsâ¦ and,  C)  itâs wrong for me to presume that everyone who sees the movie is mentally weak enough to be brainwashed by it.  I know that I should probably see the film myself before critiquing it, but I canât bring myself to do it.   Bowling for Columbine  was so full of outright lies and manipulative distortions that I canât bare the idea of putting a dime of my money in Michael Mooreâs pocket.  Besides, there are so many reliable reports on the content of the movie that it is possible to critique the movieâs themes without seeing it.     Super Size Me  must have let out about the same time as  F911 , because as we left the theater, there was a guy out front selling anti-Bush bumper-stickers, pins, and T-shirts.  Real high class merchandise, too, with messages like  âBuck Fushâ  and  âNo More Bushit.â   I just shook my head and walked away, but my girlfriend needed to use her cell phone to check her messages, so I found myself standing outside the theater, maybe ten feet from this guy, as he hocked his wares.  Every time a person passed by heâd say âDonât be silent, buy a bumper-sticker or a T-shirt and fight back,â things of that nature.  I swear, I stood there quietly for as long as I could.  I'd have ignored him if I could have, but my girlfriend took just a minute too long to check her messages.  So I approached the guy.  âExcuse me,â I asked, âbut how is buying a t-shirt or a pin fighting back?â  âItâs using your voice,â he said.  âIf you donât speak up, youâre part of the problem.â  I had to agree with that.  I could stand there and keep my mouth shut and be part of the problem, or I could say something.  So I rushed in.  I asked him exactly what it was he was fighting back against.  He told me that he was fighting back against the Bush administration and the corruption.  What corruption, I asked.    "Well," he said, "the stolen election in Florida.  And, the over 400 (he had an exact number but I've forgotten it) Republican voters in New York who voted twice in the last presidential election, for example.â  âAnd you can sight your sources for this information?â I asked.  He just stood there.  âIf youâre going to quote numbers and suggest that things like that are factual, you should be able to identify your sources,â I continued.  âWhat are your sources for the voters who voted twice in New York?â  âItâs common knowledge,â he said.  âIt was in the media.  Go to our website and read more.â  âAlright, whatâs  your website?â  âHillarynow.com.â  I swear, I didnât mean to burst out laughing.  I really had no intentions of laughing right in his face.  The fact that by then my girlfriend had hung up her cell phone and was laughing too only  made it worse.  Once I composed myself I asked him âSo the sources for the numbers youâve quoted are at your website?â  By then, however, heâd tired of my questions and began shouting me down.  âGoodbye, sir,â he shouted.  âThank you.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, sir, thanks.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, sir.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.â  It  occurred to me that he didnât want his potential customer base hearing what I was saying.  âAre you trying to censor me?â  I asked.  Of course he denied it, and as I tried to wish him good luck fighting the power by tapping into the free enterprise system, he began shouting me down again.  âGoodbye, sir.  Thank you, goodbye.â     So I said "OK, I'll check out your site.  I'll even link to it."  He kept shouting me down.  And, this time, as he was shouting goodbye at me, he threw in âOh, youâre a  REAL  good liberal.â  This kinda left me dumbfounded for a second.  Why would he assume that I was a liberal?  If I was asking questions that were counter to his point of view, wouldnât he assume I was a conservative?  I guess he thought that Iâd left the theater after seeing  F911  and that Iâd enjoyed the film, agreed with the filmâs agenda, and then failed to do the right thing by buying one of his T-shirts.  As a liberal, I guess, that made me a failure.    It boggles the mind.  So, yesterday I went to the guyâs website,   urlLink www.hillarynow.com .  It turns out that there are a number of URLâs he could have referred me to.  This guy has a number of sites up.  It seems that heâs âprofessional political activistâ from Florida who is running for Governor of that state.  I read some of his posts, his open letter to Hillary and his biography, and I just ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the guy.  I get the impression that he's very angry; very unhappy with his lot in life.  He feels persecuted for his homosexuality and he feels that some of his rights have been denied and he seems to feel disenfranchised.  He may have some legitimate reasons for those feelings, I donât know.  Most of all, he just seems to want someone to blame.  I wish now that Iâd just ignored him.  How did it do any good for me to engage in an argument with a stranger on the street?  Especially when I walked away leaving him thinking that I was a liberal?  And a bad one at that?    _______________________________________________   PS --  By the way,  Super Size Me  turned out to be a pretty good film.  We laughed pretty hard while watching it and Iâm less inclined to end up at any fast food drive-thrus for a while.  The filmâs central message seemed to be that fast food is bad for you and that fast food restaurants make a lot of money by encouraging us to eat bad food and selling it to us.  I agree with that.  There were some ideas in the film that drifted a bit too close to nutty conspiracy theories for my taste, but overall the film reminded me of  Roger  Me .  Remember  Roger  Me ?  Remember when Michael Moore was interesting?

      By now you've heard about the  urlLink idiots  at the chicken processing plant in Moorefield, West Virginia and how they tortured birds in an apparent effort to  urlLink get out of working overtime .   urlLink PETA  is out to get these morons.  Good.       Under normal circumstances, I laugh at PETA.  But I really hope they succeed in causing these losers to get fired.  There's just no sense at all in this kind of cruelty.  It makes me sick.  And besides, these jerks in Moorefield have put me in the awkward position of having to side with PETA on an issue.  You have no idea how weird that makes me feel.  And it looks like news of this may have made it to the chicken world.   urlLink The chickens are rebelling !      LONDON - A busy highway near Oxford in central England was closed in both directions Friday when around 1,000 chickens escaped from a truck that collided with four other vehicles, injuring four people.

        âIt's a real conflict for me when I go to a concert and find out somebody in the audience is a Republican or fundamental Christian. It can cloud my enjoyment. I'd rather not know."  --   urlLink Linda Ronstadt    Why isnât anyone outraged by these kinds of statements?  When a pinhead like Ronstadt says something like this, why is it like a fart in a wind-tunnel as far as the mainstream media is concerned?  If they mention it at all, itâs in passingâ¦ and Ronstadt is never called out for being intolerant, prejudiced, or bigoted.  Iâd like to know why.  Imagine if, instead of Linda Ronstadt belittling Christians and Republicans, it had been Mel Gibson saying the following:  âItâs a conflict for me when I make a movie and then find out that Orthodox Jews and Democrats are going to see it.  Iâd rather not know.â  Do you think weâd ever hear the end of it from the mainstream media?  Every liberal politician, minority advocate, prominent Rabi, and hate crime expert in the country would be on network morning news programs calling for Gibsonâs head.  The thing is, thereâs no reason to believe that Gibson would say that or that he feels that way.  For me to even suggest that hypothetically is a small slander.  Ronstadt, on the other hand, is now known to be anti-Christian and anti-Republican because of HER OWN WORDS.  And  nobody  is outraged?     I suppose itâs just that weâve reached the point where celebrities can no longer outrage us with their idiotic remarks.  Weâve been inoculated by now.  Sheryl Crow can act like she's the Secretary of State and Jennifer Aniston can call the President a "f--ing Idiot" and Martin Sheen can call him a "moron" and we just turn the other cheek.  Which is probably what we should do.  Besides, their remarks are probably best drowned out with silence.  It's just that it's hard to keep quiet when you hear crap like this:   "There's an old saying, in the days of slavery, there were those slaves who lived on the plantation and were those slaves that lived in the house. You got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master exactly the way the master intended to have you serve him.  Colin Powell's committed to come into the house of the master. When Colin Powell dares to suggest something other than what the master wants to hear, he will be turned back out to pasture."  --   urlLink Harry Belafonte    OH, Yeah, I remember how it works now.  Harry  Belafonte  can call black people slavesâ¦ but if Harry  Anderson  or Harry  Shearer  called a black person a slave, something tells me all hell would break loose.  And that goes double for Harry Potter and Harry Osbourne.   Hmmmmm.  Letâs do the math on that oneâ¦    "For me as an American, the most painful aspect of this is that I believe that administration has taken the events of 9/11 and has manipulated the grief of the country and I think that's reprehensible.â  --   urlLink Dustin Hoffman    Yep, Bush manipulated the grief of a nation in order to get the people who caused the grief in the first place.  And Michael Moore only manipulated the grief of  urlLink one American, Lila Lipscomb , in order to make a profitable movie.  That makes Bush worse than Moore, at least on a per capita grief manipulation basis.   "Republican comes in the dictionary just after reptile and just above repugnant... I looked up Democrat. It's of the people, by the people, for the people."  --   urlLink Julia Roberts    Julia Roberts can read??  Hey, everybody!    Julia Roberts can READ!!    Lyle must have taught her back in the early 90's.  And then, just to make it a little harder for us Pearl Jam fans to enjoy the music we love so much, that bandâs lead singer and learned pundit had this to say:   "I don't know if you heard about this thing called freedom of speech, man. It's worth thinking about it, because it's going away. In the last year of being able to use it, we're sure as {expletive} going to use it."  --   urlLink Eddie Vedder  , Speaking in April, 2003  Oh, yeah, thatâs right.  Free speech was outlawed on January 1, 2004.  THATâS why nobody is speaking out against this garbage.  For more of this kind of nonsense, read Bernard Goldbergâs  urlLink  Bias   or  urlLink  Arrogance  , or read Laura Ingrahamâs  urlLink  Shut Up And Sing  , or visit  urlLink Celiberal  or  urlLink Famous Idiot  on the internet.  If you can stomach it.

      "Is that a federal record in your pants, Mr. Berger?"  "No, but it ain't half bad."  (Rimshot!)  From the  urlLink Associated Press :     WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, is the focus of a Justice Department investigation after removing highly classified terrorism documents and handwritten notes from a secure reading room.  Still missing are some drafts of a sensitive after-action report on the Clinton administration's handling of al-Qaida terror threats during the December 1999 millennium celebration.  Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he knowingly removed handwritten notes he had made while reading classified anti-terror documents at the archives by sticking them in his jacket snd pants.   The FBI searches of Berger's home and office occurred after National Archives employees told agents they believed they saw Berger place documents in his clothing while reading sensitive Clinton administration papers and that some documents were then noticed missing, officials said.     And people say Nixon's plumbers were half-assed.  Give me a break!  If you haven't already, check out what Dick Morris  urlLink has said  about Berger.

      John Edwards on  urlLink unilateral US action in Iraq :    â(John Kerry) will fight for a strong military and also for strong alliances so that no young American man or woman ever goes to war needlessly because America has decided to go it aloneâ¦â    John Edwards on  urlLink unilateral US action in Iraq :    âWe must not tie our own hands by requiring Security Council action. Congress should clearly authorize the U.S. to act with whatever allies will join us if the Security Council is prevented from supporting action to confront Iraq.â    And then  urlLink there's this , from September, 2002:   "The path of confronting Saddam is full of hazards. But the path of inaction is far more dangerous. This week, a week where we remember the sacrifice of thousands of innocent Americans made on 9-11, the choice could not be starker. Had we known that such attacks were imminent, we surely would have used every means at our disposal to prevent them and take out the plotters. We cannot wait for such a terrible event â or, if weapons of mass destruction are used, one far worse â to address the clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq."   John Edwards is no  urlLink Atticus Finch , regardless of what you  urlLink  may have heard .  Heâs a different kind of bird altogether.    Observations from other birdwatchers:      urlLink     urlLink Rich Lowry :  âLiberal critics have accused Bush of calling Iraq an "imminent" threat -- in their minds, the ultimate in dishonest exaggeration -- but that word never passed Bush's lips. Edwards, in contrast, used it multiple times in reference to Iraq...How does a war against an âimminentâ threat suddenly become âneedlessâ? And again, why would Edwards, together with Kerry, vote to authorize such a âneedlessâ war? â      urlLink Pejman Yousefzadeh :  âEdwards brings a lackadaisical approach to policy and substantive discussions that is most disturbing.â      urlLink Karen Hathaway Pittman :  âEdwards represents the little guys, like you and me . . . and guys who are even little-er, like mill workers--right? Well, I mean, that's the way he made his money, representing the little people . . . so he must be one of them, right?â     This  urlLink letter to the editor  is my favorite, though:    âBoth Kerry and John Edwards voted to authorize the warâ¦. For those who know that the war was a mistake, the choice to vote for Nader in November will be an easy one.â   Yes, please,   PLEASE   vote for Nader, you anti-war people.  Vote for him in DROVES.

      I don't know that anyone who reads this blog will care, but I need to post this so I will feel better.  I need to make a public statement about this.  It's not political and not that important... just excuse me while I vent for a minute.  I am a HUGE fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  I've seen everything he's done.  Multiple times.   The Sixth Sense ,  Unbreakable , and  Signs  are extremely important parts of our DVD collection.  I have been under the impression for the past five or six years that the guy could do no wrong.    For the past year I've tracked the production of his latest film,  The Village , on the internet and waited with baited breath to see it.  All summer I've found myself literally counting the days until the film came out.  It was released today.    With blind faith we went to see it and labored to suspend disbelief throughout the film, and I have to say that we worked harder watching the movie than Shyamalan did making it.   Do Not Go See  The Village  , and if you can talk others out of seeing it as well, please do so.  This movie is awful.  It's terrible.  It's an abuse of the audience and amounts to a dirty, dirty trick instead of a legitimate film.  Shyamalan is a powerful director.  In the past he's used his powers for good.  With  The Village , he is using them for evil.    Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  I want my ten bucks back!

      I feel stupid.  All this time Iâve been going to movies to be entertained, and it turns out that, all along, movies have really been about subtle political metaphor.  I guess itâs no surprise that something like the  urlLink Manchurian Candidate  remake would have those undertonesâ¦ but did you know that even  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  had heavy symbolism?  Call me crazy, but Iâd have thought that finding texture or meaning in a  urlLink Roland Emmerich  film was about as likely as finding prime rib in a pop-tart.  But what the hell do I know?  Turns out that even  urlLink The Village  and  urlLink Spiderman 2  are full of political import.  It all went over my head.  So Iâve decided to re-examine some of the movies we saw this summer, and as it turns out, most of them were deeply political and profoundly meaningful.  Iâve followed the lead of journalists and film critics everywhere and adopted the liberal agenda while analyzing these filmsâ¦ you might be surprised at what I now realize was there:    urlLink     NAPOLEON DYNAMITE  In the character of Napoleon Dynamite, director Jared Hess does something for Democratic candidate John Kerry that his campaign hasnât yet been able to do:  It personifies him.  The movieâs title character is an obvious symbol for Kerry, and his dedication to women and minorities is represented by his friends, Deb and Pedro.  Napoleonâs internet obsessed brother Kip represents Kerryâs vision of the future, in that he is exactly like Napoleon, only older.  And, Kipâs black girlfriend LaFawnduh represents Kerryâs dedication to women and minorities, but other women and minorities than those represented by Deb and Pedro.  Throughout the movie, Napoleon (Kerry) is plagued by stupid, evil, machocentric jocks and bullies, who obviously represent the Republican Party.  He and his friends are also taunted by the teenage cheerleader hotness of the Haylie Duff character, who is an obvious symbol for teenage cheerleader hotness.  But in the end, Napoleon triumphs, at a school assembly (see:  the Democratic National Convention) where he wins over his party by performing a pointless and repetitive dance.  Badly.   Rating:  Two left thumbs up.     urlLink     DODGEBALL:  A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY  Never before has the struggle of the American military been better portrayed, symbolically, than it is in  Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story .  Vince Vaughn and his rag-tag Average Joeâs gym are a clear picture of the military, and the corporate gym complex trying to buy them out clearly represents Halliburton, or possibly Enron, Exxon, or some other evil corporate empire.  With his foul mouth, ego, bad hair and greed, Ben Stillerâs villainous character is unmistakably Dick Cheney.  Stiller/Cheneyâs greed forces the brave warriors of  Average Joeâs into a Dodgeball competition (the war in Iraq).  Along the way they face many violent, strange, and oddly dressed foes.  The most heartbreaking scene in the film comes when the team finds themselves costumed in S and M gear, a clear reference to Abu Ghraib.  But remember, the individual team members must not be held accountable for their actionsâ¦ ultimately, it is Halliburton/Stiller/Chenny/GloboGym/Exxon that is to blame.  If you emotionally withstand that scene, brace yourself for an even  more  most heartbreaking scene as Steve the Pirate, in a protest symbolic of symbolic protests, cuts his hair and puts on a clean shirt.  Rating:   Five stars out of a possible Five Star General.     urlLink     SHREK 2  The world of Hollywood has never been presented better than it is as the Kingdom of Far Far Away in  Shrek 2 â¦ and what better picture of George W. Bush than the title ogre, awkward, clumsy, and lost in a Movie-Star kingdom of fairies, pixies and sprites. And all of them understand whatâs going on sooooooo much better than he does. Itâs unclear which creatures represent Michael Moore, Martin Sheen, Sheryl Crow, and Dustin Hoffman in particularâ¦ but it doesnât matter since they all share the same correct anti-war stance.  As he wonders through this magic Hollywood kingdom, Shrek (Bush) has only two friends:  A braying jackass named Donkey (try and look at him and not see Ashcroft) and a vicious assassin whoâs name is Puss in Boots (or, should I say,   Condoleezza Rice  in Boots, nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more).  The central conflict of the movie comes when Shrek (Bush) tries to become pretty, and a viewer expects to see him end up walking around dressed in a flight suit, carrying a plastic turkey.   By the end, the ogre decides to be himself and do whatâs right, even if that means never being pretty or popular.  In an ironic twist, this makes everyone happy!  Talk about an fâin fairy tale!   Rating:  Two stars, three purple hearts, two yellow moons, a green clover, and a blue diamond.  (The film is, after all, magically delicious.)   I feel so much more enlightened now that I know to look for political metaphor in every movie I watch.  But I must admit that this kind of in-depth analysis is mentally draining.  I think the next film we see will have to be a goofy, implausable, fictious comedy, like âWhite Chicksâ or âFahrenheit 9/11.â

      I've just now come across David Limbaugh's July 20 item about  urlLink what a typical Kerry supporter might believe .  The whole thing is good, but here's my favorite bit... a typical Kerry supporter might believe that:     Preemptive military action â a first strike against a nation that is believed to constitute a threat to the U.S. â is presumptuous, arrogant, reckless and irresponsible, even if the resulting military action also liberates the people of the target nation from tyranny and brutality. But unprovoked military action against a sovereign nation, such as Serbia, that couldn't possibly constitute a threat to the United States or its strategic interests is honorable and desirable.

      Michael Moore and Bill OâReilly debated live on Fox News last night from the DNC.  You can  urlLink read the transcript  of the entire debate, or settle for this succinct summary:  MOORE:  He lied!  OâREILLY:  Did not!  MOORE:  Did too!  OâREILLY:  Nuh-UH!  MOORE:  Uh-HUH!  OâREILLY:  So what.  MOORE:  You suck.  OâREILLY:  Oh, yeah??  MOORE:  Hitler!  OâREILLY:  Hitler to the tenth power!  OâREILLY:  So what?  MOORE:  You suck!  HUME:  You two shut up right now or so help me Iâll turn this convention around and weâll GO STRAIGHT HOME.

      The moment that some of us had been bracing ourselves for came earlier this week.   urlLink Andrew Sullivan  has endorsed John Kerry.  I suppose I have three comments about that, in particular:  One, Sullivanâs non-endorsement of Bush had amounted to an endorsement of Kerry anyway.  Two,  urlLink Sullivanâs argument  that Kerry is the true conservative in this race and Bush is really a liberal  urlLink doesnât hold water  ( hat tip,  urlLink Little Green Footballs  ), and itâs evidence that even smart, worthwhile people can talk themselves into believing nonsense when their feelings have been hurt.  And, three, Iâll continue reading and linking to Sullivan because, as I said, heâs smart and worthwhile.  All of which relates to an e-mail I got from my friend Saul in Kansas the other day.  Iâve known Saul since high school and weâve remained pretty close over the years, even after he went into the army and relocated to Kansas, where he now works as an engineer for a major aircraft firm whoâs name starts with a âbâ and ends with an âoeing.â  Saulâs pretty conservative, like me, and tends to be a pretty no-nonsense guy.  So I shared his frustration when I read what he had to say the other day.     Iâm sharing this not because I think anything here is particularly enlightening, but just as part of my continuing contribution to the blog dialog.  Saulâs hypothetical questions got me thinking, and maybe theyâll do the same for you.  Saulâs questions are in green, and my âhypothetical responsesâ follow:    &gt;What does it take to be a bad president?    I think that can really only be decided in retrospect, and it's fairly subjective even then.  I say, for instance, that Bill Clinton was a bad president because he failed so badly in the areas of national defense and security.  Our enemies grew stronger on his watch, and I believe that's at least 51.00001% of the reason that 9/11 happened.  Others feel he was a good president and point to the deficit as evidence.  I guess it's a matter of priorities.  What we are really arguing about when we argue these things is who has the better organized priorities.   &gt;If Hilary Clinton was elected in 2008, would the whole country go to hell?   We were discussing this type of thing at work the other night.  Yeah, the country could withstand a four or eight year Hilary Clinton presidency.  Hell, weâve already withstood a Hilary Clinton presidency once.   :)   My position, at least in terms of Kerry, is that obviously we can stand a four or even eight year Kerry presidency.  The country can  withstand  it.  However, I believe that the guy really brings nothing to the table and gives us no reason to put him in office instead of Bush.  Kerry's campaign is "Elect me instead of him."  That's all he's got.   So, no, he wouldn't ruin the country.  But it would surely be eight years of non progress and sloppy handling of most foreign issues.  Some people argue that  Bushâs  handling of foreign issues is sloppy, and that holds water, to one degree or another, depending on the specific issue in question.  Nonetheless, I think we did the right thing in Iraq even if we never find WMDs.  And I think weâre continuing to do the right thing.  Plus, the economy is obviously turning around, so thereâs one less thing the Democrats can hang on Bush.  To me, the bottom line is that thereâs no reason to replace Bush with Kerry.   &gt; If inflation went up, if the world became more dangerous, would we even realize it?     Again, mostly in retrospect.  I donât think any of us realized how dangerous the world became during the ten years leading up to 9/11 until after the fact.  We slept through the 90âs.  Inflation, on the other hand, is certainly immediately tangible at least in terms of gas, milk, and other regular purchases.     &gt;I am trying to think of things Hilary could do that would really damage the country.   Rather than make guesses about direct actions she might take, Iâll throw out another hypothetical, instead:  Once she got in, the unity of Republicans would be the strongest it's been in years.  She'd be stonewalled on everything she tried to do, even innocuous or positive things.  That's one MORE reason not to vote for her, even if it is one that makes Republicans look bad, too.   &gt;Who is the worst president we've ever had?   Totally subjective, and anyone who can answer that question is telling you more about themselves than they are about whatever president they nominate as worst-ever.   &gt;Anyway, just feeling the frustration lately over the futility of trying to change anyone's mind about politics.     When it comes to liberals, I think what you have to do is really learn about someone, learn where their priorities are, and then point out in a friendly way that their priorities are at odds with their political beliefs. Make them examine their own personal conflicts.  Unless, of course, their priorities really do re-enforce their liberal beliefs... in which case they aren't worth arguing with and you're wasting your time.  It's like the old line about what happens when you try to teach a pig to sing:  It frustrates you and the pig doesn't even realize what you're doing.   I work with a lot of âheritage Democrats,â people whoâs social and economic beliefs are more in line with the Republican party than the Democratic party, but who vote Democrat as a matter of heritage.  Theyâre in favor of private gun ownership with few restrictions, opposed to federal funding for abortion as birth control, opposed to quotas, despise Michael Moore, favored the Federal Marriage Amendmentâ¦ the list goes on and on.  Yet they continue to vote for Democrats because theyâve been taught since they were children that Republicans are evil and Democrats represent the âlittle guy.â  So, on an emotional level, they support the Democrats, even if logically the Republicans are a better choice for them.  That doesnât make them bad people, it just makes them frustrating as hell.  No amount of arguing the logic of their vote effects them, and neither would it effect Sullivanâs endorsement at this point.  By supporting FMA, Bush hurt Sullivan's feelings.  That's where it ends with him.  I have no idea how to change anyoneâs mind about politics.  I think the best we can do is try to set a good example of what a conservative really is.  No one talked me into becoming a conservativeâ¦ I just realized that I was one by really examining the people around me.

          I came across this on the internet today and couldn't resist posting it to the blog.   Parliament of Whores  is one of my favorite books and this may be my favorite example of P.J. O'Rourke at the top of his game... if you've never read it, you're in for a treat... and if you have read it, it's probably something we should all reread now and then.  At any rate, it was worth a quick "cut and paste."  GOD IS A REPUBLICAN / SANTA CLAUS IS A DEMOCRAT From  urlLink  Parliament of Whores   By P.J. OâRourke   I have only one firm belief about the American political system, and that is this: God is a Republican and Santa Claus is a Democrat.   God is an elderly or, at any rate, middle-aged male, a stern fellow, patriarchal rather than paternal and a great believer in rules and regulations. He holds men strictly accountable for their actions. He has little apparent concern for the material well-being of the disadvantaged. He is politically connected, socially powerful and holds the mortgage on literally everything in the world. God is difficult. God is unsentimental. It is very hard to get into God's heavenly âcountry club.â  Santa Claus is another matter. He's cute. He's non-threatening. He's always cheerful. And he loves animals. He may know who's been naughty and who's been nice, but he never does anything about it. He gives everyone everything they want without thought of a quid pro quo. He works hard for charities, and he's famously generous to the poor.   Santa Claus is preferable to God in every way but one: There is no such thing as Santa Claus.

         urlLink    Congratulations to Lance Armstrong for his  urlLink sixth Tour De France victory .  He performed well and behaved impeccably, as usual, in spite of being splattered with  urlLink frog spit .  By the way, it seems that  urlLink internet rumors  about Armstrong being a political conservative are just that... rumors.  He describes his politics as  urlLink "middle to left"  and strongly opposes the war in Iraq.  Nonetheless, the guy is classy... and he expresses his opposition to the war much better than most "middle to left" leaning celebrities do:    "I don't like what the war has done to our country, to our economy," he says. "My kids will be paying for this war for some time to come. George Bush is a friend of mine and just as I say it to you, I'd say to him, 'Mr. President, I'm not sure this war was such a good idea', and the good thing about him is he could take that."     So congratulations again, Lance.  Your guts, drive, and tact are admirable.  And, it's nice to have a celebrity... and a liberal one at that... to feel good about.  PS - if my "frog spit" remark gives you the idea that I have very little respect for the French, please don't jump to conclusions.  The  truth  of the matter is, I have no respect for the French at all.

      In yesterdayâs New York Daily News,  urlLink Zev Chafets  wrote the following:    It is possible that no Democrat could beat Bush this yearâ¦.despite the polls, I don't think this election will be close, and this time the Democratic establishment won't be able to blame the Supreme Courtâ¦. John Kerry is not a bad man. He probably wouldn't make a bad President. But he is a bad candidate in a terrible situation. He represents the wing of the Democratic Party that is imbued with a sense of its own moral, intellectual, cultural and social superiority. In short, he is the standard bearer for the unbearableâ¦.    My friend in Kansas predicts a big Bush win, too.  In fact, he predicts that Kerry will only carry the District of Columbia, with the rest of the nation going to Bush.   I like the sound of that, but Iâm not as optimistic.  I think Kerry will sweep some of New England.  I think heâll also get New York and California.  I think Californians will vote for him for the same reasons they elected Arnold:  One, Californians like to âthrow the bum out.â  Two, Californians like the glamorous candidate.  I think Bush will carry Florida, though.  A lot of liberals seem to think that only other liberals were energized by the debacle of the 2000 presidential election.  Thatâs not the case.  I think Florida conservatives will vote for Bush in droves.  Some of this Iâm right about, some of it Iâm wrong about, and weâll find out on election day.  Although Iâm not ready to predict a Bush sweep in November, I do expect a decisive win, and I agree with Chafets that the far-left elitists in the Democratic party are grooming their boy for disaster.   For one thing, heâs made a list of promises that is absurd.  And, the more I watch the campaign, the more I become convinced that the elites really believe that those promise are valid and  will  be kept.  They seem to really believe that getting rid of Dubya is the answer to all their prayers, and that if Kerry is elected, the world will turn into a magic land of sunshine for minorities, women, peaceniks, hippies, artists and ketchup heiresses everywhere.  As Penn and Teller might say,  bu!!s#it.  From  urlLink CNN :    Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said Thursday he would have handled news of the al Qaeda attacks on New York and the Pentagon differently than did President Bush.  Bush was told of the suicide hijackings while he was in a Florida school classroom.  "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to -- and I would have attended to it," Kerry told the Unity conference of minority journalists in response to a question about what he would done.â    Whoâs handling the Kerry campaign now, Michael Moore?  From what Iâve heard, the seven minutes Bush spent reading to those children was a major point of Mooreâs anti-Bush movie.  I think thatâs why Kerry responded the way he did.  And I think that if Kerry had anything real to offer the voters, heâd have answered the question differently.  Heâd have said something like  âLook, quibbling about how the President spent seven minutes of the worst day in national history is splitting hairs.  Iâm not going to dignify that kind of partisan distraction.  Iâm campaigning on real issues and I have real ideas.â   Of course, Kerry doesnât have real ideas.  Thatâs why the elites handling  his campaign are ready to split hairs.  They think that the box office take of Mooreâs film translates into movie goers who are ready to vote their way.  I think theyâre wrong.  From  urlLink MSNBC :    In Washington, Kerry spoke to minority journalists at their quadrennial Unity convention. He was "warmly accepted throughout his speech and he drew big applause with his comments about the lack of minority journalists and ownership of television stations and newspapers," MSNBC.com's Darrell Bowling reported. "He says when he's president he would make sure to bring in an FCC chairman who would fight to increase minority ownership of broadcast outlets."    Who at the Kerry campaign thinks this is going to play in the heartland?  Do they think that NASCAR dads (full disclosure:  I am one) and the other  people who work 40 hour weeks in the fly-over states really care about the owners of broadcast outlets?  For starters, we see most of them as liberal.  Secondly, any idiot can put two and two together and equate âmedia ownerâ with âwealthy liberal.â  Most of us in the heartland hear a remark like that as Kerry promising to make more opportunities for minorities to become wealthy liberals like he is.  Besides, if you mention the FCC to most Americans these days, theyâll probably be more curious about what the Commission has done about Janet Jacksonâs nipple than what itâs done for elite journalists, minority or otherwise.  The Kerry campaign is digging itâs own hole, folks.  I donât know how deep itâs going to end up being, but it seems pretty clear that itâs going to be just deep enough.

      From  urlLink Fox News:    SALT LAKE CITY  â Mark Hacking told a "reliable citizen witness" in the psychiatric ward that he killed his pregnant wife as she slept, according to a probable cause statement released Tuesday by the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Department.   He told the witness he then threw Lori Hacking's body in a garbage can, according to the statement.   For some reason I just really  wanted  this guy to be innocent.  I knew it wasn't likely, but I hoped she'd turn up alive.  Things like this make it hard to keep reminding myself that I oppose the death penalty.

      Just doing a little blog browsing...     Bill's Big Bloviating Blog  urlLink takes issue with Roger Waters (late of Pink Floyd ) and his politics.  I agree with Bill on the issue, but I guess I'm a rock-star sympathizer.  I just don't expect these guys to really know what the hell they're talking (singing) about.  It comes with the turf.  Waters' album   Amused To Death   is one of my favorites of the past decade... and, politically, the album is somewhere to the left of Jerry Brown.  Arthur Chrenkoff is probably the MVP of blogspot.  His latest  urlLink round-up of good news from Iraq  provides perspective you won't get anywhere else.  Watch the news, read the papers... but then check out Chrenkoff for the whole picture.  And MuD  PHuD has  urlLink good news for America , as well.  Weapon of Mass Distraction found some  urlLink interesting info from Matt Drudge .  Do Republicans want to do away with the IRS?  I'm not entirely  libertarian , but I am open to considering the idea.  Let me go ahead and come out of the closet on this issue, too:  Yeah, I'm one of those nutcase right-to-lifers.  No, I  don't  stand on the street screaming at people as they go into Planned Parenthood, and yes, I  can  conceive of hypothetical instances where abortion makes sense... nonetheless, abortion as birth control strikes me as inherently evil.  I do believe strongly in the right to choose, though.  If you aren't at a point in your life where you could provide for a baby if one is conceived,   exercise your right to choose not to have sex.    Anyway,  urlLink this item at Say Anything  really fired me up.  No, I'm not ready to bomb a clinic, but as a parent and a human being, I am pissed off.  Is Michael Moore a Republican mole?  The Therapy Sessions has  urlLink an interesting argument .  Not saying I buy it, mind you... but I did stroke my chin and frown and raise my eyebrows while reading it.  That's gotta count for something.  I found some  urlLink good reading for us P.J. fans  at The Commons.  And there's a new  urlLink "Best Of"  edition out at Homespun as well.

      Leaving the DNC with a full head of steam, the Kerry-Edwards campaign is crossing the nation, making every effort to promise their way into the White House.  For those of us whoâve wondered exactly what it is that Kerry has to offer the nation, we now have an answer.  He has promises to offer.  And lots of them.  Kerry has more promises than Carter has liver pills.  Kerry closed the convention by promising a stronger defense, more international respect, lower taxes for working Americans, a better economy, the destruction of Al Qaeda, a bright future, fewer missing pregnant mothers, more staring roles for Parker Posey, and that he personally would put a chocolate mint on the pillow of every American every night of his presidency.  OK, I made up the part about Parker Posey.  But if weâre gonna shoot for the moon, why hold back?  Like all campaign promises, Kerryâs were designed to sound good and mean nothing.   The problem is, like in everything else, Kerry doesnât know what heâs doing in the empty promises department, either.  By over-extending his reach to the point of satire, Kerry made so many promises that they donât even  sound  good.  They sound transparently empty.  Even  urlLink academic economists and the Boston Herald  donât buy it:   âKerry's suggestions that he will seek to close corporate tax loopholes and end corporate welfare are political pandering with little chance of success. More troubling is Kerry's pronouncement that he will not privatize or cut Social Security benefits for retirees - without detailing how to pay for the explosion of costs associated with retiring baby boomers.â    So what does Kerry  really  have to offer?  How about better rhetoric?  Make no mistake, on this Kerry is clear.  As he told  urlLink a job-hungry crowd in Pennsylvania , John Kerryâs metaphors are better than George W. Bushâs metaphors.  He just isn't impressed with Bush's talk of having "turned a corner."   "Let me tell you something, folks: The last time we had a president who talked about turning a corner, and ran on the slogan of turning the corner, was Herbert Hoover, and he ran on the prospect that 'prosperity is just around the corner.' I don't want to run talking about turning the corner, I'm running to climb the mountain and get to the top. And that's what I'm going to do."    I guess that makes it obvious why the Democrats are more unified than ever before.  After all, theirs is a candidate whoâs  urlLink been there and done that :   "Kerry is not your typical Democrat challenger," said his foreign policy advisor Susan Rice. "He is a decorated, battle-hardened veteran. He understands war."   Yep, and heâs still battle-weary after all these years.  After all, John Kerry spent more than three months in Vietnam.   Almost four whole months, man!   He lived it and breathed it for damn near  half  of one whole tour of duty.  Yet, somehow, he emerged from all of that with his ability to speak in metaphors still in tact.  And he suffered, too.  As Democrats go, heâs practically John-Frigginâ-McCain!  He suffered three wounds, none of which required hospitalization, and then came home to continue the fight.  Of course, when he got home, he was fighting  against  the soldiers he left behind, but thatâs not the point.  Heâs a fighter.  Thatâs the point.  And heâs rested, ready, and raring to go.  Itâs August, the election is three months away.  John Kerry has thousands of miles to cross, millions of hearts to reach, and God knows how many promises to make.  _________________  (Don't Miss  urlLink  Words make the Party  by Ken Hughes.)

      Just a bit ago I posted an entry saying that Iâd not have time for any of my usual tiradesâ¦ but that turns out not to be the case.  I do have time for one little rant, inspired by my favorite subject, that idiot Michael Moore.  According to what he said while discussing his favorite books  urlLink at Oprahâs website , Mikeâs weight problem isnât his fault.  Itâs the result of economic struggles earlier in his life:   "I grew up in a Midwestern industrial city: Flint, Michigan. If you were to fly there today, get off the plane, and walk out of the airport, you would say to me, "Mike, you're one of the skinniest people here." I wasn't an overweight kid, but in the mid to late 1980s I was collecting unemployment, about $99 a week. When you are on such a low income, you end up eating foods that are cheap, fast and starchy because they fill you up. I put on the bulk of my weight during that time, and it didn't come off."   Thatâs right, Mikeâ¦ cheap, fast, starchy food is fillingâ¦ and if you eat it by the metric ton and refuse to exercise, itâs filling enough to turn you into a huge, fat lying bastard!  Alright, what I said in the previous paragraph was mean and spiteful, I admit that.  And Iâm just getting warmed up.   Classic liberal thought:  Moore blames his weight problem on having been unemployed, not on his own actions.  He readily absolves himself of accountability and shifts blame to that Regan era phantom villain, unemployment.  It was supply-side economics that made Mike fat, not the Doritos he was shoveling into his gorge with both fists.  And even if it was the Doritos, it damn sure wasnât a result of Mikeâs  personal decision  to buy them and eat them!  He was poor, after all!  He couldnât afford luxuries like lettuce and canned tuna!  The subtext is palpable.  Michael Moore blames Ronald Reagan for making him fat.  And besides all that, thereâs another Michael Moore flat-out lie here.  Itâs a trivial lie by his standards, but a lie nonetheless:   "In the mid to late 1980s I was collecting unemployment â¦ I put on the bulk of my weight during that time."   OK, Mike bulked up in the mid to late 80âs, right?  Letâs examine that claim briefly.  Here's Michael Moore on the poster for  Roger  Me , which was released in 1989:   urlLink     He's not rail thin by any means... nobody is going to mistake him for Kate Moss... but he's no whale, either.  Now, let's look at a picture of him from the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year...   urlLink     Obviously, in the late 80's, Moore was a shadow of the huge, bloated behemoth heâs become since he became wealthy.  Michael Moore probably  really did  put on most of his weight by eating cheap, starchy foodâ¦ but it was a wealthy film maker who ate the junk, not an unemployed guy in Michigan.  None of this should surprise me.  Moore's movies and books are collections of lies and dillusions.  I guess he defines himself personally with the same tainted logic that shapes his world view.  Look, my own weight has gone up and down my whole adult life.  When Iâm lazy and eat junk food I get fat, and when I exercise regularly and eat well, I get thinner and healthier.  Nobody gets the blame or the credit but me.  I struggled to support myself and my family while working a cruddy service job during the late 90âs and at that time I was the skinniest Iâve been in my adult life.  Nowadays I have a secure job that pays well and my weight is up.  Iâve gotten fat.  And the reason Iâve gotten fat is because Iâve made bad decisions.  If I can take the credit and blame for my own actions, why canât a rich dude like Michael Moore do the same thing?  Michael Moore is a fat liar, and thatâs the straight skinny.  _________  Oh, yeah...  I got so worked up above that I forgot to mention the  urlLink first and most obvious lie  in Mike's argument about his weight.  Michael Moore did  not  grow up in Flint, Michigan.  He grew up in the wealthier, non-industrial suburb of Davidson.  Besides, while I can't disprove his claim that he'd be perceived as one of the skinniest people in Flint, it's obvious BS.  If the people in Flint have been pounding back so many cheese fries and Slurpies that a man Mike's size is skinny in comparison, then THAT is the story of the year.  Not Iraq.  If Flint has gotten that fat, Mike needs to do his next movie about THAT subject.  Call it   Fahrenheit 7-11  .  The image links above weren't working, so I put the pictures on my own server space and changed the layout of the post.  Each of the images above is a link to something relevant... Thinner Mike takes you to the IMdB's  Roger  Me  page.  Fatter Mike takes you to the MSNBC article where I found the image.

       urlLink    Itâs vegetable canning season.  For the first time in a couple of months, every inch of counter space in our house is  not  lined with tomatoes, peppers, etc.  Instead, gradually, the counter tops are getting lined with hot mason jars filled with homegrown veggies, each one announcing itâs successful seal with that distinctive popping sound.  If youâve never grown and canned your own vegetables, youâre missing out on one of lifeâs great joys.  My point is, my light blogging over the past several days is due to having my hands fullâ¦ and itâs likely to continue through the late summer.  I did want to take a minute to post a few links, though.  I still have time to read a bit and obsess over the presidential race, the war, and the news in generalâ¦ even if I donât have time to sit down and type up my tirades about it all right now.   urlLink Employment in America :  Just how many jobs are there in the US right now, really?  Can we know for sure?  Is the payroll surveying system reliable?  The Heritage Foundation has some ideas and information.   urlLink Swift Boats, Kerry, and Bush :  Hereâs a fairly unique point of viewâ¦ an anti-Kerry, anti-Bush, anti-Swift-Boat-Vets-For-Truth republican.  I suppose William McTavish is actually in favor of  something , but Iâm not sure what.   urlLink Sacrifice and Service :  Jeff Bergner has more interesting things to say  about  the Moore/O'Reilly debate than either of them actually said  during  the debacle...uh, I mean, the debate.   urlLink Cuddle Parties :  I heard Neil Boortz talking about this the other day:   âAt the outset, participants form a circle where they establish their personal boundaries - "I won't touch you anywhere adult, if you don't touch me anywhere adult" - and then the cuddling begins, with little interference by the host, who plays New Age tunes from his laptop.â   If thereâs one phrase I hope to never utter to another human being as long as I live, it has to be  âLetâs touch each other in a non-adult way while we listen to that new age music coming out of that guyâs laptop computer.â    urlLink Rick James :  Did the GOP have him taken out to keep him from endorsing Kerry?  Well, of course they did.  And, in doing so, they caused us all to miss the chance to see Teresa dancing to  Super Freak  at Kerryâs inaugural party.  Oh, how I hate that Dick Cheney!  Finally, we re-watched the movie  urlLink   Three Kings   on DVD the other night.  Ten bucks at Best Buy, and well worth every penny.  I remember enjoying the film when it was new, mostly for itâs cinematography and action sequencesâ¦ but the movie is downright resonant in a post-Saddam world.  If you havenât seen it, rent it or pick it up on DVD.  Itâs the story of some Desert Storm soldiers who turn down a chance to abscond with some of Saddamâs ill gotten gold, and, instead, help some Iraqi refugees escape the dictator.  Iâm sure that liberal Hollywood didnât intend to make a film that, in retrospect, is now very sympathetic to the American cause in Iraqâ¦ but thatâs how  Three Kings  plays now, and itâs enjoyable on many levels.  Oh, yeah... if youâll excuse a totally irrelevant asideâ¦ I have to say that the more I hear Nickleback, the more I realize I was far too hard on Creed.
