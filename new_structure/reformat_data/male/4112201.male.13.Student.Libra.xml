         urlLink               Koreans have developed and use a unique alphabet called Hangeul. It            is considered to be one of the most efficient alphabets in the world            and has garnered unanimous praise from language experts for its scientific            design and excellence.                         Hangeul was created under King Sejong during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).            In 1446, the first Korean alphabet was proclaimed under the name Hunminjeongeum,            which literally meant "the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the            People."                         King Sejong, the motivating force behind Hangeul, is considered to be            one of the greatest rulers in the history of Korea. Highly respected            for his benevolent disposition and diligence, King Sejong was also a            passionate scholar whose knowledge and natural talent in all fields            of study astounded even the most learned experts.                          urlLink               When King Sejong was not performing his official duties, he enjoyed            reading and meditating. He could also be very tenacious at times and            would never yield on what he thought was right. Love for the people            was the cornerstone of his reign (1418-1450), and he was always ready            to listen to the voices of the common folk. He was a ruler of virtue,            with the welfare of the people dictating all policy formulations.                         King Sejong also established the Jiphyeonjeon, an academic research            institute, inside the palace. Noted scholars from all academic disciplines            gathered here to engage in lively discussions and also to publish a            variety of scholarly books.                          urlLink               During his reign, King Sejong always deplored the fact that the common            people, ignorant of the complicated Chinese characters that were being            used by the educated, were not able to read and write. He understood            their frustration in not being able to read or to communicate their            thoughts and feelings in written words.                          urlLink               The Chinese script was used by the intelligentsia of the country, but            being of foreign origin, it could not fully express the words and meaning            of Korean thoughts and spoken language. Therefore, common people with            legitimate complaints had no way of submitting their grievances to the            appropriate authorities, other than through oral communication, and            they had no way to record for posterity the agricultural wisdom and            knowledge they had gained through years of experience.                         King Sejong felt great sympathy for the people. As a wise ruler strongly            dedicated to national identity and cultural independence, he immediately            searched for solutions. What he envisioned was an alphabet that was            uniquely Korean and easily learnable, rendering it accessible and usable            for the common people.                          urlLink                Thus, the Hunminjeongeum was born. In the preface of its proclamation,            King Sejong states as follows:                         "Being of foreign origin, Chinese characters are incapable of capturing            uniquely Korean meanings. Therefore, many common people have no way            to express their thoughts and feelings. Out of my sympathy for their            difficulties, I have invented a set of 28 letters. The letters are very            easy to learn, and it is my fervent hope that they improve the quality            of life of all people." The statement captures the essence of King Sejong's            determination and dedication to cultural independence and commitment            to the welfare of the people.                         When first proclaimed by King Sejong, Hunminjeongeum had 28 letters            in all, of which only 24 are in use today. The 24 letters are as follows.       urlLink
