      8.17.04 â Seeley G. Mudd Hall, University of Southern California 	Itâs our second day of training preparation.  Yesterday went pretty well.  It was a bit drawn out.  The work we actually had to accomplish could have been done in about 4 hours instead of the 8, but thatâs just me complaining probably.  The other incoming students pleasantly surprised me, as most seem to be quite normal people as well as chemists.  I think Iâll be just fine in their company.  I was my usual charming self to these new compatriots, and I believe that most of them at least found me mildly entertaining and tolerable.  What can I say, Iâm intoxicating.    	I should probably get going because the flock is starting to come together for training again today.  (I arrived early today.  The train was really flying.)  Today we have some TA training.  We are running a sample lab.  I am sure I will feel very judged on my chemistry and laboratory skills.  I did my best to over prepare last night though.  I spent three hours studying the lab Iâm doing today.  We were only supposed to read through it, I think, but I made sure to research the background theory behind it.  Better to overachieve early to know what I can get away with later.  Iâm such a dork. â¦ Later that same night, 	Iâve been calling my apartment âThe Work in Progressâ.  Looking around it is easy to see why.  I plan to eventually get seating, internet, gas for my stove.  All the luxuries in life, but right now I have none of these things.  Iâll get there. 	I throw this out now more as a teaser than anything.  I canât really elaborate at this point because I know my mom reads this blog every once in a while, but if youâre curious email me.  Last night I had a situation arise.  It was one of those things that seem to happen to only me.  I donât know how, but I always find myself in the oddest situations.  Iâm not really complaining because it really keeps my life interesting. 	If youâre really curious about what my life is like, Iâll let you know right now.  These days I get up fairly early to get ready to go up to USC via train and bicycle.  I spend the day there doing some sorts of training.  Iâve enjoyed the first few days.  The company is nice and the work is something I really enjoy doing.  Then I come back home and pretty much find ways to fill my time until I can go to bed.  I know I could go to bed at anytime because I donât really have anywhere else to be, but I still canât really let myself go to bed much before 10.  I gotta play it cool.  At night I like to watch scrambled Olympic coverage on my TV.  It doesnât come in very clearly with my rabbit ear antennae, but they only come around once every four years, so I take in anything Olympic that I canâ¦  What the hell am I talking about?  I started out talking about my normal day and ended in a discussions about my love for the Olympics.   I love Michael Phelps.   Iâm determined to work harder than pretty much anyone else in my incoming first year graduate class.  I spent much, if not all, of my night last night preparing way more than I ever had to.  But Iâd rather know I overworked than to learn too late that I didnât work hard enough. I should go to bed.  Iâve been drinking some beer to put me to sleep.

         Kiah is at USC.  I'm in some type of student center.  I think USC has several different types although I'm not really certain of what each of them is for or if I'm even at the right one.  I'm assuming that I can be here.  I went to the previously described informal lunch of death.  It really wasn't all that bad.  Maybe because not that many people showed up.  But hey, what do I have to do with my time that is more deserving.  Nothing, that's what.      After the lunch I got showed my new desk.  How exciting.  Nothing like being crammed in a space with a few other people.  But I am grateful for the space.  Then I got roped into a meeting.  It was fine, but I wasn't ready for it.. I'm running out of time on this computer, gotta go.

         Here's the thing.  Although many will argue otherwise, I don't really like dating.  It's hard, awkward, and generally unpleasant.  Now many of you that know me well will say that I do it a lot for someone who doesn't really like dating.  True enough.  But I date more out of necessity than desire.  I like being comfortable with someone and having a relationship with them, but getting to that point most often requires some form of "dating".  Both parties have to get all dolled up to impress the other.  We have to look nice, but not too formal.  One wouldn't want to scare the other party into thinking one is a stiff.    I guess I could deal with the dressing up part.  I like dressing and clothing in general, but what really gets me about dating is the smalltalk.  I'm not good at it.  When I first meet someone I can honestly say that one of the first things that goes through my head is not, "Good lord, this girl is so hot.  I just gotta know what her favorite movie is..."  But that's what people do to fill the gaping holes in conversation that can't yet be filled with relavent information.  I can't really talk about the kind of progress I made on one of my Xbox games on the first date, for example.  I have to talk about what kind of work I've done, schooling I've completed, my family.  Now all of these things are important granted, but a telling someone I'm a chemist is not really a great jumping off point for conversation with a large majority of the population.  It's a shame, but it's true.    I say these things of course because I did have a date of sorts this afternoon.  Not that I was looking for one, but I got one.  I met her at the previously described party.  Seems nice enough.  Things seemed to go well.  I guess it must be my natural charm or something.  They went well enough to meet up again tonight.  Which is fine.  Might as well get all of the awkwardness out of the way as soon as possible.      I am bleeding from my face right now which isn't going to help me out tonight.  I thought was just picking away some of the skin that was still peeling from my Hiroshima like sunburn, but evidently I had taken the plug off of the end of my aortic artery.  Why do cuts from the face always produce so much blood?  I think I do a pretty good job of keeping my head elevated above my heart...    Tomorrow I have my first scheduled commitment at USC since I arrived in California.  It's an informal lunch.  Just a little get together with other incoming first year grad student.  I've already documented my fears about other these other students.  It's only worse that it is an informal setting.  That means more small talk.  It's like going on multiple dates at once.  Horrible.  I don't even want to think about how many times I'm going to hear the phrases, "Where are you from originally?", "Where are you living now?", and "What made you choose USC?"  Guh...

      Iâm riding the train up to USC right now as a sort of practice run before I have to start doing it for real next week.  The train just stopped at the Compton station.  Compton really isnât all that scary of a place.  At least by appearance.  Iâm not saying I would want to be dropped off in this neighborhood at night, but itâs not the urban jungle I had anticipated.  Upon further viewing I see that almost all of the houses have bars over the windowsâ¦  Some guy just got on the train with his bike.  Looking at it I see that his bike does not have any working breaks on it.  This dude obviously felt it more important to purchase a matching shirt and hat ensemble than put breaks on his bike. No brakes and matching shirt and hat guy aside I have been pleasantly surprised with how normal most people are out here.  I think itâs just because I was anticipating every single person to have ridiculously odd quirks that I find this to be true.  I will say this for Californians, they really follow traffic signals as pedestrians.    The train has gotten really full.  To the point that there are quite a few people standing holding onto a rail.  Yet Mr. Matching Hat and Shirt continues to take up two seats.  Oh, there a brave soul just stood up to the forces of coordination and took the sear previously occupied by one solitary leg.    Itâs hard to type on the train and make sure my bike doesnât fall on someone, so Iâm going to stop typing.  Plus I can tell my stop is coming up because of all the razor wire I can see.

      Iâve been in Long Beach for over a week now.  I really like it.  Except for the parking ticket I got.  I donât like that.  I got it for parking on the street when it was scheduled to be swept.  Kinda like streets being cleared for snow emergencies, except that itâs not an emergency.  These Californians must really like to keep their streets clean if they feel the need to sweep them once a week.  Itâs that or palm trees produce a lot more waste than I ever imagined.  	Since Dad has left my days have been pretty low key.  I get up, play a little Xbox, eat a little something, think of some errand to run, and ride my bike.  Those are the kind of things I fill my day with.  Itâs not boring yet.  It still feels like vacation.  Sure, I mix up my days with a few other things to do such as going to the gay cyber coffee shop.  I figure itâs a tradeoff.  I get to use their internet connection, and they get to look at me.  Seems fair.  Okay, theyâre getting hosedâ¦ but I really need their internet connection.  I donât have an internet connection at my apartment, and Iâll be honest, I donât have many leads on how to get it.   	This sunburn needs to go away soon.  Iâve based my activities for the past few days on the time of day they could be done so that I donât have to feel the burn of the mid-day sun.  I should have figured the sun would be a lot more intense out here.  Iâm so foolish.  But I will say that the areas of my body that have recovered from the burn are looking quite good.  	Oon Saturday night Dan, Jon and I went to a party in West Hollywood.  It sounded a lot more glamorous than it ended up being.  How did we end up at a party in West Hollywood you ask?  Danâs ex-girlfriendâs friend from high school lives out here and knew somebody who was throwing a party who invited us.  Yeah, it was kind of a round about way to get invited, but weâre willing to take any bone that gets thrown our way at this point.  I canât say that it was overly exciting.  Basically, the three of us stuck together in a little herd.  I/we did meet one interesting girl.  Genessaâs from Orange County, and she said sheâd show me around Long Beach sometime this week.  Itâll be nice to learn some of the more intricate parts of my new hometown.  It will also be nice to talk to someone not Dan, Jon, my father, or a complete stranger.    	Iâve started saving my receipts from all the purchases Iâve made since I got here.  Itâs like entering into a whole new stage of adulthood.  	Beth Burnes informed me while I was on the phone with her tonight she thought the state bird of California is the California quail.  It sounds made up to me.  She might be a liar just like Dad.  But again I donât have any choice but to believe her.  I will give her credit for bothering to care about my fascination with state birds and at least making an attempt at finding Californiaâs for me unlike anyone else.  Thatâs right, Iâm talking to youâ¦  	All of the incoming graduate students at USC were given each others emails so that we could email each other with comments, questions, invitations and the like.  After receiving a few of these emails Iâm beginning to fear meeting some of these people.  Not all of these mass emails Iâve received have made me fear meeting the other incoming students at USC.  (I havenât yet sent one out.  Iâm choosing to remain a mysterious stranger until orientation begins.)  But a few of them have left me with a bit of doubt if I can ever really get along with these people.  Iâm sure Iâm just being cynical, but I thought Iâd give a sampling of the two worst offenders.    	The first guy to send out one of these mass emails was a bit too excited for my taste.  Now I understand more than anything he was just probably nervous, but really I donât think thatâs an excuse for spelling âWhatâs up?â with a âZâ.  Itâs just not necessary.  Later offenses in his email included using the phrase âkeen on having some contactâ with other incoming students.  Excuse me, did you just use the word âkeenâ.  I donât know how they do it in Connecticut, but in Minnesota that word went out with âScooby-Doo, Where Are You?â  And not the crappy new Scooby-Doo shows or the stupid movies.  Jinkiesâ¦  He also tried to be way too cool.  Despite his best efforts to cover his tracks he was quite stiff with his language.  I mean, I already know heâs going to get his Ph.D in chemistry.  His cool train left the station a long time ago.  Even I know that.  	The second offenders email was not as long, but the content was soâ¦ I donât even know what to call it.  Iâll just cut and paste because I will never be able to find the words to describe.  Anybody from the gang is interested in going for the Phil Collins "First Final Farewell Tour", he is performing at Staples  Center close  to USC  on August 31 at 20:00 hours.  I am a big fan of Phil, and plan to go there, if there are people willing to join, it will be great.  U can check the site: http://www.philcollins.co.uk for Details  Reaction from Kiah: Stunned Silenceâ¦ more silenceâ¦ an uncomfortable laughâ¦ Lordy what am I getting myself into.  (Note: Any fans of Phil Collins reading this that are currently offended, I apologize.  Get a copy of Rolling Stone magazine.)

      Alright everybody, here it is.  I've decided post my online journals on an online blog.  Future posts could happen quite often or never again.  Who knows?  I'm a wild card.  A few people mentioned they couldn't open the journal attachment I sent out via email a few days ago, so I will attach them here as the first entry into my world of blogging.  7.29.04 12:56pm, somewhere outside of Des Moines  	I handed Dad the wheel of the Mazda about 15 minutes ago after we stopped for lunch at Rubeâs Steakhouse (the âOriginalâ grill your own steakhouse.  Is this even health code legal?)  Des Moines seems like a reluctant city.  The good people of Iowa probably decided a long time ago that they needed at least one âmetropolitanâ area and nominated Des Moines.  Seems logical to me.  	How much corn can one state produce?!?!?!?!   This is ridiculous.  And I grew up in central Minnesota.  Iâm sure itâs only going to get worse as we progress westward.  Iâm going to poke my eyes out with 6â ceramic gnomes.  (If you donât know about the gnomes, know only that they are our faithful travel companions on our journey to the Golden State.  They donât have names yet.) 	Aside from my music collection and my adoring and wonderful father there is only an Ikea catalog, a Rubikâs cube, and some crossword puzzles to keep my mind off the over stimulation that the scenery is providingâ¦ I really like that bed in the catalog.  Not that I have anyone to share it with at night.  (Single tear)â¦  Rubikâs cube is such a frustrating endeavor.  Who invents something like that.  I want to solve it so bad. 	Thanks Dad for pointing out there doesnât seem to be any birds in the air.  Creepy.  Oh wait, I just say oneâ¦ and anotherâ¦ My Dad is a liar.  But he is currently demonstrating his vast knowledge of state birds.  He says the state bird of Iowa is the goldfinch.  I have no choice but to believe him even if he is a liar.   	Omaha is still 84 miles away.  2:29 pm, Omaha, Nebraska 	Iâve never been to Nebraska before.  I guess my life is complete now.  Dad was impresses with Rosenblatt Stadium, home of the College World Series.  Well, maybe he wasnât impressed with the stadium as much as the fact that I new what it was.  I watch a lot of SportsCenter. 	I was pleasantly surprised with the remaining part of western Iowa.  The hills were quite lovely.  Iâve been told that Nebraska doesnât offer the same kind of visual relief.  My dad says the state bird is the meadowlark. 	There is something unnerving about hearing your own father sing along with Outkastâs âSpreadâ. 	The thermometer says its 91 degrees in Omaha.  What a shitty city.  At least to look at.  There is a water tower shaped like a coffee pot.  That was cool for this city. 	Dad is upset that he hasnât seen any fields of sunflowers yet.  I hope it doesnât turn into bad karma and all we see for three straight hours is sunflowers.  I like sunflower seeds.  I hate playing baseball though.  Mainly because Iâm really bad at it. 	I think the gnomes are getting nervous that weâre bringing them back to their previous site of detention, Kansas.  Thankfully this isnât the case..  I currently favor the names Dextrorotatory and Levorotatory.  They could go by Dex and Levo. 	Ooooh, time for a pit stop.  Flying J, here I come.  5:41 pm, 70 miles east of North Platte, Nebraska (I canât believe thatâs a landmark) 	After getting out and taking care of business at the Flying J (including a photo op for the gnomes) I got back behind the wheel.  I couldnât tell you how long I drove for.  The time sort of melted together.  I think I passed the same patch of corn 73 times.  But the map says weâre further west now than when I started driving.  It doesnât look any different.   	There was a giant arch over I-80 in Kearney, Nebraska.  I giant arch was the best they had to offer.  Donât these people know that they should really be making a bigger deal of historic Fort Kearney?  It was an actual fort in Oregon Trail!!!  Thatâs something to take notice of. 	There are telephone wires on the right side of the interstate now.  They are some of the most interesting things Iâve seen in hours. 	Iâve noticed a lot of Nebraska license plates are numbered oddly.  They have a few numbers, one letter, and then a few more numbers.  Make a decision.  Numbers or letters.  Stupid flip-floppers.  Who are they, John Kerry?  JK, vote Shrub out of office! 	Iâd like to think that the USA wouldnât have taken in the central part of the country if they hadnât wanted the West Coast so badly.  Thereâs no other reason for this to be in America. 	Iâm going to try and do some crossword puzzles now.  I like to do them when my Dad is around because he usually knows the answer.  I guess thatâs the same reason I donât like to do them while heâs around.  6:26pm, I donât even know where we areâ¦  	Things have really picked up in the last 40 minutes.  Okay, 10 minutes.  But Iâll take what I can get.   	First of, I didnât make much progress on the crosswords, but while working on one the Mazda was brutally assaulted by a piece of wood.  I think it came off of a semi somehow.  I just heard the noise and caught the tail end of the attack.  It appears that the Mazda has escaped without harm.  Sheâs a brave auto. 	Next, we saw our first road sign for Denver.  284 miles.  It sounds like a lot, but itâs a start.  At least it can be thought about now.  Not that I wasnât praying for it to come sooner before. 	Thirdly, and unfortunately, lastly in exciting news Nebraska has some hills.  I saw them in the distance and as I write this we have actually gotten into some of them.  It turns out the hills are part around North Platte.  Dad actually remarked that it was âvery pretty around here.â  I told him it was only pretty by comparison. 	Now weâre past North Platte.  Thankfully the hills have gone away again.  Whew, I thought they might stick around and ruin Nebraskaâs good name.  6:55 pm or should I say 5:55, still somewhere horrible in Nebraska 	We have entered the Mountain Time zone!  Flat as a rock thoughâ¦  6:45 pm, heck yeah weâre in Colorado. 	There is an instant change in scenery upon entering the Rocky Mountain state.  The land here is very rolling and quite rangy in appearance, as Larry (my Dad) puts it anyways.  Me, I think I eloquently put it as âless agriculturallyâ than Nebraska.  Iâm retarded.  Dad keeps saying that this is what he anticipated Colorado to look like.  I expected mountains.  Iâll show him.  I know that there are mountains here somewhere.  I saw them when I was in that damn Denver airport four times in a week and a half.   	Jon and Dan remained in front of us all day.  They did start three hours before we did, so I guess they can win this round.  Itâs okay with me.  I had a kick-ass night before I left, so I wasnât in any hurry to get out of St. Paul this morning. 	I really like the vibe Iâve gotten from Colorado so far.  Itâs got a definite kick-ass frontier feeling to it.  I like that in a stateâ¦ Iâll be honest; I havenât gotten out of the car yet in Colorado.  I could be completely wrong about it. 	Dad is confident that the state bird is the Mountain Bluebird.  9:25 pm, Guesthouse Denver Stapleton Hotel 	This place takes a long time to check into.  But Iâm glad that weâre finally at a stopping point for the day.  My back hurts, and the gnomes are getting crabby.  There is a pool here.  They should like that. 	Can you have a dog in a hotel?  That lady seemed to think so.  It didnât look like a seeing-eye dog, either. 	Denver kinda smells funny.  A little like wonderbread if I had to put my finger on it.  Also a little like a donkey. 	Uh-oh, they gave us a room with a king-size bed only.  Dad is going to throw down.  Iâm sitting in room that Iâm not going to be sleeping in typing.  I should go find my Dad.  Personally, I could probably just crash anywhere tonight.  Iâm so tired.  11:11 pm, Still at the hotel 	I thought that I could have plugged into the internet at this hotel.  Turns out to be not true which is frustrating.  I would have liked to send out an email update.   As it is Iâm going to watch The Entourage on HBO.  Itt a new series produced by Mark Walberg or somethingâ¦ I know heâs involved somehow.  7.30.04 12:09 pm, just inside the Utah border 	I took the wheel from Denver to the Utah border.  It was a good four hours journey through the Rockies.  There was some very pretty scenery.  (Even the gnomes approved.  I think they finally believe they are not being returned to Kansas.)  Driving in the mountains was kinda fun.  A challenge, but fun.  I wouldnât want to be driving a Uhaul and towing a Ford Escort like Jon and Dan, thatâs for sure.  They again started out much earlier in the morning than Dad and I did.  We havenât caught up to them on this trip once yet.   	I canât express how much I love the song âLove Isnât Always on Timeâ by Toto.  Itâs playing through my ipod right now.  What a good song.  Maybe my favorite to sing along to.  Dad and I have been singing quite a bit this morning.  Heâs not very good, but I love him just the same. 	Iâm a little disappointed with Utah.  Not the scenery, which is very cool looking.  (Imagine what you think Utah would look like.  It looks exactly like that.) No, what Iâm disappointed with is their âWelcome to Utahâ sign.  You know the signs that every state has like âWelcome to Nebraska.  It was probably a mistake that you came here.â  I really believe that Utah is missing out.  They are still celebrating their hosting of the 2002 winter Olympics.  That was two years ago.  They are missing out on a huge opportunity to cash with âWelcome to Utah, home of Ken Jennings, best Jeopardy player EVERâ.  It should be even easier now to get that sign up with him between Jeopardy seasons to get him to pose for the sign.   	For those of you that donât know who Ken Jennings is Iâm not going to take the time to explain.  Just Google his name and see what youâre missing out on.  Plus, if you donât know who he is Iâm very disappointed in you and a little glad Iâm moving away from you.  JK BFFâ¦ 	Dad doesnât know what the state bird of Utah is.  2:42 pm, somewhere in the depths of Utah 	I will hand it to those Mormonâs.  If anyone has the fortitude to settle such a barren land then by all means they can have it.  It really looks like another planet here.  The landscape seems to revolt against itself in large upheavals of rock.  It certainly is beautiful in a sort of postcard fashion.  I canât believe that anyone really lives here.  I donât even see any animals.  This only enhances my opinion of Ken Jennings.  7:23 pm, The Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas 	I took over the driving with an hour and a half left in Utah and got us into Vegas.  Things ran fairly smoothly, although there was a brief gas shortage scare.  We had to backtrack through a few towns Iâm pretty sure shouldnât have existed to find a station, but we made it.  Once we got back on the road we didnât stop until we hit the City of Sin. 	Dad is checking into the hotel now.  Iâm sitting off to the side people watching and writing in the lobby.  Nobody really looks like they know where theyâre going.  Everyone has a kind of dreamy, curious face on. Dan and Jon are at the Fairfield Inn in Vegas somewhere.  Theyâre going to call when they are ready to meet up.  Itâll be good to meet up with them after chasing them this whole trip. 	Itâs never really being a strong desire of mine to go to Vegas.  I donât mean to sound like I donât want to be hear.  I just figured Iâd lose a whole bunch of money and pout about it when I did come.  I always figured Iâd get here sometime in my life.  Now seems like as good as any.  Maybe I can get good and drunk in front of my father.  That actually is more of a personal goalâ¦ Iâm hoping to just take in a bunch of things in this city and be a good olâ tourist for a while.  7.31.04 9:17 am, Hotel Room in the Sahara 	All five of us on our way to Los Angeles went out on the Strip in Vegas last night.  Good times.  Vegas is definitely everything I thought it could be.  Dirty, hot, and overly stimulating.   We started out at the Sahara buffet.  Something was quite satisfying about getting a chance to eat at one of these memorials to gluttony.  Once is enough though.  At dinner the five of us made our plans for Saturday, such as how, when, and where we would meet up in Long Beach.  Dan, Jon, and Dale (Danâs dad) had to take off from Vegas early this morning.  Thankfully Dad and I donât take as much time to travel in the Mazda as they do in a Uhaul.   After dinner (Can I even call it that?) we took off down the Strip to see what we could.  After gawking at some of the more extravagant hotels Dan, Jon, and I found a $5 blackjack table in a crappy, err, not so glamourous, casino.  They only reason we went into the Boardwalk Casino is that they advertised $3 tables.  They had one, and it was full, so we saddles up to the âhigh-rollersâ $5 table.  Jon was out of $20 in about 7 minutes and 13 seconds.  Dan and I had more luck.  While I was happy to turn my $20 into $45, Dan managed to turn his into $100.  Lucky Bastard.  I shouldnât complain though.  I am happy to leave Vegas with a shirt. I hope Dad comes back from the pool soon.  Iâd like to get on the road soon.  So would the gnomes.  They think the Circus Circus casino clown is after them.  8.3.04 10:31 pm, 1532 E. 2nd St., Long Beach, CA  90302 Apt #13, my new home! 	What a frantic few days the past few have been.  We got Southern California in the late afternoon of Saturday after a few stops along the way from Vegas.  Most importantly we stopped at the In-N-Out Burger in Barstow, CA.  Many other people had this idea as it was quite packed.  Barstow is really the only resemblance of civilization between L.A. and Vegas.  Itâs really not even all that big, but the fact that something is there at all makes it stand out distinctly against the Mojave Desert and Death Valley. 	Dan and Jon had arrived several hours before Dad and I had and had taken care of some Uhaul business beforehand.  They had reserved a room for us at the Motel 6.  It was a thing of splendor.  Anyway, when we got there they had all of the local newspapers out and were desperately seeking a living arrangement suitable for four recently graduated men.  This proves to be quite a task in SoCal.  We never found a place that had four actual bedroom that we could live in.  (For those of you wondering why we were searching for four bedrooms there is actually another Hamline alum coming to school down here that we had planned to live with.)   After minimal success we managed to contact a management company that had a bunch of available apartments that we might want to check out.  Dad and I went to grab the listing.  While we were out we got sidetracked looking at potentially available apartments.  It was during this time I realized how difficult our dream would be and began thinking it might be easiest to find a single apartment and let the others find a three bedroom closer to where they will be going to school and working in the OC.  (Heck yeah I picked up some local lingo.) Dan and Jon thought that this may be giving up a dream too fast, but I was fairly confident that this would be easiest for all parties involved after I had spent the next day wondering the streets of Long Beach dead dialing any and all available properties I came across.  After a full day of searching I finally came across a studio apartment that I felt was compatible with my desires for a new home.  Itâs 2, count them 2, blocks from the beach and about 10 blocks from the train station I need to get to in order to ride it up to USC.  After living all four years on campus at Hamline Iâm officially a commuter. The past two days Iâve spend getting my ducks in a row so to speak.  I signed my lease.  Iâve got two crazy landlords.  I think theyâre a married couple.  Dad had his doubts.  Helen and Henry.  He goes by Hank, I thinkâ¦ Anyways, I believe she is the crazier of the two.  She showed me a few of her available apartments.  About 10 minutes into the tours her zipper on the back of the black pants (I usually think zippers that are not placed on the front of the pants make the pants really attractive.  Helen managed to dispel this thought however) had come undone and her pants started to sag a little few inches lower than God ever intended.  Nothing horrible, but in a way it was all too horrible.  She also brought up odd subjects of conversations such as West Nile Virus (She really seemed concerned about this) and the Muslims taking over Minnesota and turning into an independent Islamic state.  I have no idea where she got this tasty bit of information.  I told her after 22 years in the state I hadnât heard of this.  She was convinced though.  If not Minnesota, then Wisconsin she said.  Dad convinced her that it was one of the Dakotas just to get her off the subject.  Hank more or less seems to be Helenâs henchman.  Nice guy but more of a grunter than anything. After I got the keys to my new place in hand we unloaded the Mazda.  Iâm amazed at how much stuff I crammed into that car.  We then drove up to north Long Beach to pick up a mattress.  I didnât mention it yet, but I definitely have a Murphy bed in my apartment.  You know one of those mattresses that fold up into the wall.  Well, mine doesnât go into the wall, it swings into a closet, but itâs the same general principle.   By this time Dan and Jon had found a place that would work for them.  They came to visit me at my place before they went to sign the papers for their place.  The two of them, my Dad and myself went to grab some dinner at La Fuente restaurant.  The Mexican food here has all been really good so far.  Jon got a burrito called the King.  It was the size of a carp.  Iâm not kidding.  Iâve never seen an entrÃ©e that large.  It was such a marvel that I had to get a picture of him with it.  It was like eating a forearm. Today I took Dad up to USC.  Except that I got a little lost along the way.  We got off on the wrong train stop and ended up walking an extra 4 miles through south central L.A.  Builds character.  We did eventually find USC.  I picked up my relocation check and changed my personal information with them.  We then went to the bookstore so that we could pick up stuff to outfit my family in USC Trojan apparel. On the way back to my place we picked up a bike for me that we had shopped for earlier in the day.  Itâs a steely baby blue GT combination street bike.  Iâm glad Dad was there.  He knows a lot about bikes. After another run to In-N-Out Burger for dinner (this time in Seal Beach) and another run to Target for more apartment supplies we came home for the night. Dad has been a lot of help on this trip.  Iâm glad heâs here.  I have a feeling Iâd be in a cardboard box if he wasnât.  Tomorrow weâre going to Ikea in Carson.  How pumped am I?  Quite. I should also learn what the state bird of California is so that I can learn to appreciate, love, embrace, and hunt it.  Well, maybe not hunt.  8.5.04 12:02 am, my apartment in the LBC 	Ikea is so sweet.  Dad and I spent the afternoon there.  When we got back I spent the rest of the night putting together the stuff that I purchased.  I gotta say I really like what I got so far.  I say so far because weâre going back again tomorrow to indulge even further with a shelving unit.  I really like this deskâ¦ 	The funny thing about Ikea is the same funny thing about Las Vegas.  The whole place made me feel disoriented and totally off task.  I didnât really know where I was supposed to be or what time it was.  I just knew that I was having a really good time.  And in the end I guess thatâs what any good place should make you feel. 	I like living alone so far.  At least setting up to live alone.  All the decisions are mine.  No one elseâs opinion matters about the way things look or how much they should cost.  Itâs up to me and I like that.  Iâm such an independent spirit.  Maybe not, but it doesnât matter. 	Weâve been on this crazy journey for a week.  I probably shouldnât call it a journey because itâs really a more of a destination.  Plus the word journey is used way too often in reality television, to the point that it makes me hate the word.   	The poor gnomes have been cooped up in my apartment while Dad and I took care of business setting up my apartment.  They still have dopey smiles on their faces though.  Theyâre such good sports.  I should take them to the beach soon as a reward for their excellent behavior.  8.6.04 (my birthday!!!) 7:08 pm,  1532 E. 2nd St, Apt #13 	Today is my birthday.  Because of the situation itâs a lot different from my past few birthdays.  Which is to say that there arenât a ton of people and mass quantities of alcohol being consumed.  Itâs been pretty low key.   Dad and I went to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.  We both figured if I didnât go in these first two weeks I would never go.  Itâs probably true.  It was a really nice aquarium, and Iâm glad I got to go.  Way too many kids for my taste.  We ended up leaving when   This is Dan.  Kiah left his journal mid-sentence when Jon and I arrived.  Iâve never written in somebody elseâs journal before.  Can I share my thoughts?  Seems like I should reserve those for my journal.  Happy Birthday Kiah.  We got sick of them.  Then we went to a nice seafood restaurant because thatâs what I was in the mood for after viewing all those fish.  Jon and Dan are here.  Time to rip up Belmont Shores.
