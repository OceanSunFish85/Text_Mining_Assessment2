       I don't want to go off on a rant here, but is anyone else disgusted with the choices of candidates we have this election? We can choose "Dubya", who in my opinion, is an ignorant red-neck from Texas who only wants our oil under Iraq's soil, or we can choose Kerry, who by my opinion(and we all know that opinions are like ass holes), is a weak kneed liberal who only says what he says because it will get him votes.(And lets not forget, he won Three Purple Hearts. We can't forget because heharps on it! But, anyway.)   What ever happened to public office being a public service? Now it is a way for big business to control the country by putting their puppets in office. You should'nt be able to get rich by guiding the views of your constituents. Both Kerry and Bush are money grubbing, two-faced criminals who bend the system to their whims and we, the common folk, reap the so called "rewards".   We need a candidate who can speak his mind and not bow to party and big business' will. We need a leader of the caliber of F.D.R. or of Kennedy. Not the grudge holding power monger in office now. And not the botox boy who wants to lead the Democrats back into the White House.   I would just as soon elect "Hillary" than either one of these two clowns, andbelieve me, Ifuckin hate HILLARY!(Just thought I'd let you know for sure how I feel about these guys{like youcouldn't tell})   Well, I've vented my frustrations for now. Please read and post what you think.  Thank you all and have a "Nice" day.  Kamron

           I don't wanna go off on a rant here, but is George "Dubya" Bush out of his fuckin' mind?!?!  What's up with all of this "The Lord told me to win or something bad's gonna happen" crap?  Who the hell does he think he is?  Moses incarnate?  I thought that the time of miracles has passed.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it.  I think President Bush's latest idiotic statements are a lame attempt to gather votes from the White Anglo-Saxson Prodestants(W.A.S.P.s) who back his whole "ban gay marrage" Constitutional Amendment.  Anyway, I'm through ranting about this for now.  I have some "Real" issues of my own to take care of.  Have a "nice" day and remember, if you don't bitch about something, your letting the bastards get away with it. Kamron
