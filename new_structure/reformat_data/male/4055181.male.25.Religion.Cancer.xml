      I neglected you yesterday. Iâm sorry. I actually tried to talk, but something happened and I didnât have the patience to try and do it again. You crossed my mind several times, but nothing ever really came of it. Is this the beginning of the end or is this simply a speed bump on the long, winding road?  Someone asked me how I was doing yesterday. I lied. Well, I at least didnât tell everything. I felt great yesterday, but I simply said, âFine.â I donât think that person really wanted to know. Do you? I donât think many people really do.   I canât tell where the fault lies, though. Do those who ask know and understand that no one will really tell them? Or, do those who receive the question understand that the questioner has no desire or intention of knowing the truth?   It all seems to me to be mere face-saving decoration. We need people to think that our interest in them runs deeper than âhi,â but none are willing to be sincere. Itâs a faÃ§ade that has harmed society.  No one is real anymore. Instead of taking the time to be real, it seems to be more expedient to pretend; to fake. In the end we donât have a clue about reality. That, to me, is scary. Even excrement, when itâs all dressed up, can look inviting. The deception is not in the disguise of it. The deception began long ago. You see, we donât even know that itâs âgood-looking excrementâ. We just see it as something new, and before long, everyone has to have it because of one blind soul who thought he could start a fad.  Thatâs what Iâm going to be on the lookout for today â excrement. However, I may already be too far gone to recognize it.   Agape, Joey

       Likely comment, huh?! I guess I do that to about everyone. The main problem is not so much that I ask, it's that no one holds me accountable for having asked. I can ask you how you are and you don't even expect me to really want to know. Most of the time you don't really even want to tell me. Maybe that is what has become of us. We have no more expectations. The hunt is through. The friendship has been conquered. No more thrill.       Why do I seem to constantly want that thrill? What about "thrill" gives mesecurity? Does it make me feel alive? Am I conditioned to be entertained at all times? Do I really believe that real information must be pleasantly served in order to be aptly absorbed? Weddings, funerals, worship, rallies, and even politics! It's all trimmed up nicely. It's all so precisely thought out and planned. The problem is IN the trimmings!! Excrement can even look good if properly prepared! It won't be that we believe it to be pretty. It's that we don't recognize it!       That's what I'm going to be on the lookout for today - excrement.I don't guess I can blame anyone anymore because most of us don't even know that we're serving it.      Agape,   Joey

      I guess we have come to the second day of our relationship. The newness of it all is still fresh and we are getting to know each other. Or, are we? You see, I'm doing all the talking. In fact, it seems to me that I am speaking to no one. That says a lot. Relationships go this route quite often. It's not always an interpersonal thing either is it. It's our relationship to work. Our relationship to our new car and house. Our relationship to our puppy or kitten. Our excitement has peaked. The decline will soon ensue.   I do this with God so often. I'm on a high and I lose it after it wears away. My promises fall to the floor and join the dust that has its origin in the same lacking. Likely company. I can laugh in Satan's face one moment thinking that his exit is certain. It wasn't and will never be. Longevity is in the foundation. Length is in the inches. Units give distance.   What is your unit? How do you measure? I have been using the whole instead of the ingredients.   I do hope to see you tomorrow. If we do not, it may be a fault of my own. In fact, if precedent influences what is to come, I most certainly will be to blame.  Agape, Joey

      Today we begin a journey. It's nothing that will be recorded in the history books. No one will look at us and point our lives out as turning points in society. But, today, nonetheless, we will embark. Together. I don't know how long it will last. I don't even know if it will last. But, I do know that for just today, we will walk together. This is an accomplishment which has not been seen by many. Even tomorrow we may follow the steps of so many before us who part before they can be friends. I do hope that will not be our course. Our chat and time have so far been well spent. I do hope to do it again soon.   Agape, Joey

      Backwards.  Everything is now backwards.  Not in front.  Does it look choppy to you?  Me, too.  Clarity is such a mistaken state of mind.   How often do we plan on making everyone believe that everything in our minds is nothing anyone would want to know.  But in the end, if it were known, no one would be surprised because we all live there.  We all have thoughts and motives.   Doesn't this room look familiar?  It should.  You don't know I live here, too.  Your keys are missing.  That shoe wasn't there last night.  The whole time we have all lived here.    It doesn't seem overcrowded until stress shows up.  Then everything is strange.  We suddenly feel the presence of everyone in the same house.  All of us.  Everyone.  Does it yet feel stuffy?  We have covered up our tracks (at least we think we have) and we feel that no one will know.  Maybe they never will.  We have become  that  good.  At least we have become that good at convincing ourselves.   I believe everything I say.  Sometimes I don't even have to say it before it's law.  Is this working for you?  It has been so long since we have spoken.  Are you getting mad?  I would be.  In fact, I might be getting a little angry at myself.   The sloth is a common house-pet isn't it?  I don't know why.  It eats everything in the house while messing it up and it never cleans up its aftermath.   HE WILL EXPOSE US ALL!!!  Agape, Joey
