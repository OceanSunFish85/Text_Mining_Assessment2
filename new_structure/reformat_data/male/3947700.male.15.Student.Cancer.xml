      Everyone knew this day would come. The day where I discuss Evolution. Obviously, this will take a lot of discussion, so don't expect me to be done quickly. I will take my time.    First off, for those who don't know (if there are any), Evolution consists of Ric Flair, Randy Orton, Batista, and, of course, Triple H. They were formed a few years back. The name goes with the members. Ric Flair is the past. Triple H is the present. Randy Orton and Batista are the future of Raw.    Evolution has dominated the Raw roster for as long as they have been formed. They are the essence of a heel faction, good wrestlers who talk the talk, and walk the walk.    Eventually a breakup will occur, however long this takes, nobody is sure. For now, though, they are working hard to stay on top.    I will now break down the Evolution members.    Ric Flair    Ric Flair is a sixteen time World Champion. He is the history of wrestling, and arguably the best wrestler of all time. He is also in his sixties. His prime is over, and his chances of winning the World Heavyweight Title are slim. He is there to teach, and to piss off the fans (though many still like him).  Randy Orton  Randy Orton, like The Rock, is a third generation superstar. He has always known his future, wrestling. I belive Randy brings back some of the "old" stuff, actual wrestling. He isa great wrestler, knows holds well, and I don't believe that he is credited enough. He gives the WWE a bright future, and with a large feud with Edge forming, the WWE's future gets brighter everyday.  Batista  I like Batista. A six foot six monster, he is a great power wrestler. Also holding a bright future, Batista just needs a feud to begin. This feud is to be with Kane! Why can't the WWE see? Make one of them a face! This would be a great feud, and the fans would love it! Hell, put the World Heavyweight Title into it! Make it huge! It's not like the WWE can't promote it!  Triple H  Ahhh, Triple H. If he isn't The Game, then no one is. Obviously gaining fat, Triple H is not the wrestler he used to be. He still puts on the best matches. His Raw match in San Antonio vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Title still gives me chills. I may not like him too much, but I have to admit that he is great.   Well, there is the members of Evolution. Do you see why they are where they are?   When I continue with the Evolution articles, I will discuss the rise to power.

      Well, here I am sitting here, and I am thinking of what to write. Of course it will deal with RAW, because this is my favorite show. Every Monday night, I go upstairs at 8:57, wait for Star Trek to end (I don't like that show) and start watching. My heart pumps whenever my favorite wrestler comes out (The Rock), whenever Kane comes out (another one of my favorites), whenever Shawn Michaels comes out (love his music), and whenever Triple H comes out (come on, he's Triple H!).    I guess I might as well start by reviewing RAW Wrestlers. I will rank them on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest. They will just go alphabetical. I am reading this off of the WWE site, because there is no way I know them all by heart.    -A-Train Rank: 4   I do not know much about the A-Train because he used to be a Smackdown wrestler. I believe that he does not fit on RAW, which could explain why he isn't been used. There is no storyline available for him, and I am not sure of his wrestling capabilities. Maybe one day he will be brought back in, probably not.  -Al Snow Rank: 3   Again, I don't know much about Al Snow,I wasn't watching during his prime (if there was one). I think he is a decent announcer for Heat, and probably good on Tough Enough. Who knows? Who cares?  -Batista Rank: 7 Potential: 11   I have to admit that I love the potential of Batista. If there is one guy in this business that can succeed, it is Batista. At first, his wrestling looked dim. But in recent weeks his wrestling has been pushed up. Yes, he needs much more work, and is still a little bit behind, but he will get a title shot soon. I love his main finisher (the sit-down powerbomb), and if he can get a good, long lasting feud that isn't dealing with Evolution matters, but personal matters, he will succeed. I also don't believe he can remain heel for too long.  -Chris Benoit Rank: 9   I did not know of Chris Benoit until he jumped over to Raw. I have to admit, I didn't like him at first for I was rooting for Shawn Michaels in the triple threat. After he continuously won, I was forced to jump on the bandwagon. I love how he brings so much wrestling skill to the Raw roster, and if some Raw members are smart they would try to learn from him. I think that he does need to add some more on television before he hits the sharpshooter, crossface, headbutt, or suplexes, because otherwise he is just using high intensity. Throw in a DDT! Overall, he is a great champion, and is definitely a main eventer.  -Chris Jericho Rank: 7   Definitely not a Jericho fan. I enjoy his wrestling skills, and I enjoy the Highlight Reel, whichmeans I enjoy everything, I guess, but for some reason I still don't like him. If he gets aWorld Title push I will probably get sick. I can't handle watching him facing against Triple H for the title (I say Triple H because they wouldn't go Face-Face with Benoit). Maybe my view on him could change (likeit did with Benoit) but for now, I amnota Jericho fan.  -Chris Nowinski-SKIP  -Christian Rank: 7   May I presentto you, the best heelof this time period. Yes, Ijust calledChristian the best heel. He is dominating the midcard ranks, andonce heis healthy again, hewill continue to do so. He gives Raw a good boost at midcard, and I enjoy watching him. If he will stop the feud withJericho and move on,I could see him going far. He could (a possibility) reach Triple H's heel heights on the topcard. Maybe I'm a dreamer, butI thinkit could happen.  -Chuck Palumbo-SKIP  -Edge Rank: 6   Yes, I ranked Edge a 6. Maybe it was because I was bored of sevens. Maybe it was because Idon't care for him (as a wrestler),I am not sure. I didlike an interview he gave (can be found on lordsofpain) and like the guy. I just don't think he fits onour roster. A heel turnis needed as he is not getting the face results expected. I can't say much on his past, but I doknow his future, which is a title push. If the WWE is smart, they will continue the Edge-Orton feud to a higher, topcard level and there will be great success. I highly enjoy watching Edge and Orton, they work welltogether.  -Eric Bishoff Rank: 5   What can I sayaboutEric Bishoff? He is the classic heel General Manager. I don't care for his storyline with Eugene. I think that he shouldchoseone lowcard guy that he likes and give him the push he needs. But then again,it isn't Bishoff's choice, is it? Let him have a say instorylines, he did run the WCW, didn't he?  -Eugene Rank:6   Here is the comedy. You either like him or you hate Eugene. I cannot wait untilnext week, on Raw, when Eugene is heart broken. Maybe they will finallymake a faction to counter Evolution, which is oneof the strongest factionsever.The one thingI dislike about Eugene is that he does that angry thing. Get rid of that. Eugene wouldn't use a chair, I don't believe so at all. Points to the guy who plays him (Nick something, I believe), for thecharacter isplayed well.  -Garrison Cade Rank: 5 Potential: 8   Yes, I added apotential rank to him. At this point, being coach's b*tch doesn't fit him well. Maybe this is the guy that Bishoff pushes to midcard/topcard level. I think he can do well. And what is this about HBCade? God, I hope not!  -Jerry "The King" Lawler Rank: 6   As the heel announcer, he pushes stuff to much. He needs to back off a bit, and just slide some of his comments in there. Sort of sarcasm, I guess. I liked him for that short period of time that he was face with JR.  -JR Rank: 8   I love JR. I love listening to his commentary, and I think he does a great job for the WWE. Without him, the WWE could be at a lost.  -The Coach Rank: 3   Yes, the lowest rank so far. Why is he in the ring? I don't care if he works out, he can't wrestle! Stick to announcing on Heat, Coach!  -Kane Rank with Lita storyline: 7 Rank without Lita storyline: 8   I've always liked Kane...masked. Now that he has changed so much, he is just a big guy. He is no longer, well, Kane! I believe he should get a push and feud against Triple H. If the WWE was really smart, they would have continued a feud after Armageddon, with Kane vs. Evolution. Yet again, the WWE failed. Shame. If Lita is pregnant the hole time I will flip over to Who's Line during that part of the show.  -Matt Hardy Rank: 1   Your prime is over, Matt!I don't care for you! You are a cruiserweight and a tag-team wrestler. You have neither! Leave!  -Maven Rank: 4 Potential: 7   He doesn't get the credit he deserves and never got a push. I think that they could stick him against Cade and bring that matchup up the levels: Heat-lowcard-midcard. Then you can see what to do with him.  -Mick Foley Rank: 6   He is doing nothing now. I'm sorry, Mick, but your day is over. You should move on with your life in the WWE, maybe doing something else (announcing?). I liked your Orton feud, for a while, and I also think you can Co-GM. Maybe a few wrestling appearances here and there.  -Randy Orton Rank: 9 Potential:11   Yes. I gave Randy Orton a 9. When Evolution breaks up, Orton and Batista will make a huge push. These guys have the talent, and Orton is really respectable in the ring. If he could just hit the RKO every now and then! It's like Flair on top of the ropes! It's never going to work! More on Orton later.  -Rhyno Rank: 5   Rhyno, you are washed up. If you can find a good tag team partner with you, then you can make a good tag team run, that's it. I won't even talk about you, I just dislike you.  -Ric Flair Rank: 7   Two words: Washed up. A few match appearances here and there, okay. I can see that. Managing? I can see that a little clearer. That is where Flair should focus, teaching.  -Rob Conway Rank: 6   Tell you what. Conway makes me sick and will never get out of the tag team show. He should be on Heat. I'm not going to continue on him.  -Rosey Rank: 4   So when is the WWE going to release this guy? For a while he was a good bridge between good matches, but he isn't a wrestler. He is a piece of SHIT (Super Hero In Training). Unless there is a storyline for him somewhere, he doesn't belong on Raw.  -Shawn Michaels Rank: 8   Wow, have you ever thought of how many potential headliners Raw has? I like Shawn Michaels, and I think that when Evolution breaks up, somehow he and Triple H should join forces. I can't wait for his feud with Kane. This should bring Kane up a little and lower Shawn down a little, giving a window for wrestlers such as Batista, Orton, and Edge.  -Shelton Benjamin Rank: 6 Potential: 8   This guy has the capabilities. He is still missing two things. A finisher and a good opponent. One good feud (not with Orton) could spark this guy. A future headliner is found within him. I like his potential, I just think Raw is a little crowded right now.  -Steven Richards Rank: 4   Forever going to be locked on Heat, Richards should be sent to Smackdown, or be used just as a manager for someone (whether it be Victoria or not). If he is shown on Raw dressed in drag again, I might go ballistic. -Sylvian Grenier Rank: 6  Again,he is foreverdoomedfor the midcard ranks, though he and Conway coulddo well as a tag team. I am tired of this Canadian/French thing. By the way, why did they change it to Canada? -Tajiri Rank: 5  Here we have a cruiserweight who wassent to Raw in effort to splitup him and his friends on Smackdown. He needed achange of scenery anyways.I think this guy can do well in tag teams, and can be used for comic relief. That's about it. Maybe a push or two for theIntercontinental Title. -Test Rank: 6  I didn't like him at all when he wasuninjured, and Idon't want to see a return of him. Where will he go? He is useless on Raw, send himtoSmackdown. -The Hurricane Rank: 6  I have to admitthat I likeThe Hurricane. Yes, he will be lowcard forever, but if sent to Smackdown, he can helpthe cruiserweight push. I like his skills and like him as a person, also. Loved his matchwithFlair,wish it was longer. Like his music. -The Rock Rank: 9  Finally! I get to sum up The Rock! As mentioned before, I like The Rock. I wish he comes back to WWE for a good amount of time. We can surely use him as a face. When is his feud going to happen with Triple H? I am dying for a feud to happen, it could go for a year or more! It could go down in history as The Rock and HHH will. After HHH, feud with Orton! This would be great! -Triple H Rank: 9  Triple H can be as good as he wants to be. When he is focused, he is the best. When he isn't, he is just average. I like him, but I wish he was a face character for a little while. But that will never happen, because he plays the heel so well. I guess the only thing to ask is this: When will he get the title back? -Tyson Tomko Rank: 4 Potential: 7  Member of Christian's army. No wrestling skills. Only potential is him kicking Christian's butt. I can't believe he takes orders from Trish Stratus. -Val VenisSKIP -William Regal Rank: 5  I like Regal, but he needs to get in better shape. He can be a good midcard.   Okay, I ended some of these short because my fingers are killing me. This took a while to write, and if you read it all I appreciate you for reading all of my hard work. Got a problem with my ranks? Comment on them!

      I've decided to start a blog on the WWE. For all those who read this, here is some info on myself.I've been watching the WWE for a few years now. I just started watchingbecause my parents finally let me (and I got a television in my room). So my historical knowledge cannot compete against those who have been active watchers for a while.  I do keep up on the current stuff, though.   If you wish to reach me, you can email me at  urlLink benpitch@gmail.com . Any comments, though, are asked to be written on the blog. If you have a personal question, some new info, I can be reached at that email.    The site that I credit most of my knowledge from is  urlLink www.lordsofpain.net . This site is great and I thoroughly enjoy it. I have also visited other sites, such as  urlLink www.wrestlingnewsworld.com .    I highly recommend you to visit  urlLink www.lordsofpain.net  to get up-to-date information on the WWE and other wrestling subjects.    Well I guess that's it! Off to blog!
