      ANGEL      I donât think much about it anymore, but there was a time I couldnât get it out of my head.    It was a day I didnât think I would survive, the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless. I wanted to get it out and fast. I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent. I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood. I canât remedy it.    Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.    There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.    I feel creative but canât understand why. Itâs been months since I have written.    The sunlight wakes me again, and I want to die.    I hear Massive Attack in my headâ¦..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there. Angel, Angel, Angel. I love that girls voice.

        I understand    It is defined by truth and reality, it is not the love I feel for you that is truest, and it is my action in response to that love. I love you because in china a butterfly flapped its wings. I love you because the centrifugal force of the earthâs rotation makes me. I love you because you are whole and sane and so beautiful it hurts to touch you. I love you because at night your sweet dreams move your body closer to mine, skin touching for days it seems. I love you because when I wake next to you and the sun shines over our bodies, Mother Nature tells me this is the most natural thing I can ever have. Human life is but a mili-second in the big picture so there is no time to waste. In the morning you smell of sweet vanilla when I press my face into your neck. Your breasts curving so gracefully, I watch the lines of your body and try to memorize them. Your fingers so soft and strongâ¦not to dainty and not to hard. Itâs the kind of thing you wish for when you are single, or at least when I was single, and lucky enough I got what I wanted, no less and no more. At night when you wrap your legs around me I almost melt. Your sweet lips covering me like a cotton sheet of sweet desire. True is your love for me.
