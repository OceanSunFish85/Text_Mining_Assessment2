      Just talked to my girlfriend "Katie"about a lot of things. One of which is my having sex with other women. She asked me when was the last time I was with someone else and I told her about "Debbie" and our hooking up yesterday. She said that she was glad that I was getting it from someone regularly close to home (hopefully regular anyway). The distance between Katie and me is a bitch. She's in a shitty marriage as well. We can't get together often enough to keep either one of us satisfied. She asked about me having a double standard regarding sex, that is is it ok for me to fool around and not her? I told her if I could do it she could do it with my blessing. Then she proceeded to tell me about a guy she met near her that she's been chatting with for sometime now. They've talked about sleeping together. I've got to tell you I find this hot. The thought of her getting porked by another guy just arouses the hell out of me. Even if I'd never be able to watch her go at it just hearing her tell me this is so erotic. They might be getting together soon. God I'd love to have a spy-cam.

      Holy fucking shit! That was just awesome. I met "Debbie" at her work. Well actually I intentionally went in to show her who I was and who she'd be getting ravaged by in a short while. I could see the sparks flying between us when I looked in her eyes. We got to the motel and in no time we started pawing at each other. OMG!!! what a receptive pussy she has. I had her cumming time after time fellating her wet hole. Finished her off by fucking her doggy style, drilling it home good and proper. When I came I let out a groan and slammed it in once more, grinding my hips into her ass. Even with a rubber on she felt the throbbing and pulsating of my pole when I reached my breaking point. God what a lay! What a way to spend a Friday afternoon. Fuck buddies indeed. This is going to be a steady fuck for me.

      from the timeline to fantasize about tomorrow's tryst. I just rejoined AFF Monday before last and I'm already getting laid. That's quite a response for me. She answered my email right away that night and we talked on the phone. We chatted for awhile breaking the ice. God she's got a nice voice. After awhile she started talking dirty making me REAL hard, asking me how big I was getting. She brought me to orgasm just listening to her. I'm gonna drill her good.  God how I need regular sex with a woman that excites me.  Depending on how we hit it off, this may be a regular fuck-fest.  Good, a fuck buddy! About time by god.

      The greatest fear of many a man is that he passed up the woman who may well have been "the one." Looking back at my single years that very well may have been true.I didn't date a great deal but on reflecting upon my past I realized that there were many fine women who were interested in me. It's just that I was so thick-headed that I totally missed the signals they were putting out.    While in college, I remember going home night after night past lovers sitting on park benches in heavy embrace, some in various stages of lovemaking under the stars. I saw guys leading their girlfriends to their rooms for a night of heavy sex. As for me, I was alonefucking my fist. I convinced myself that I was all alone and that no one wanted me. For someone who should've been sewing his wild oats at that time this was quickly driving me nuts. Self-doubt and questioning my attraction to women was a daily occurence. True or not, it seemed to me that I was in the minority in sleeping alone at night.    I remember working at a variety show put on in the school of music. I was a stagehand that year. A woman in one of my classes was in a skit. She wanted to talk, and I couldn't spit out a word. She was quite attractive, damn near beautiful. Another potential lover I met as a freshman in bowling class. We hit it off extremely well in class. I made her laugh, which to me is a good sign. Best aphrodisiac in the world, right?Even though she was practically eating out of my hand,I couldn't get myself to ask her out. Another I met at a Christmas singing event. The sparks of attraction were flying, but once again I couldn't get myself to close the deal.  Even witha woman that I had met all the way back at freshman orientation who would've been an easy lay, I found myself backing away at the crucial moment.    I honestly cannot recall all of the ladies I passed by through the years before getting married. A number of them stand out in my mind. One in particularabsolutely stole my heart with just her presence. "Lori" was the lady who made my knees weak. I felt a chemistry with her that was so strong it made me ache. Sure enough, she asked me out for drinks after work and I said that I had school in the morning. I backed away again. I spent the next two years trying to convince her that I really was interested while she dated others. I was eating myself alive inside thinking of what she was doing with them and knowing that I had blown my chance. Me being a passive-agressive didn't help at all. She did give me opportunities to start out but each time I was too dense to see it. I eventually moved away with her making one last ditch attempt to start someting on my last day in town. I went to my old workplace, saying goodbyes to all that I still knew there. There she was, as gorgeous as ever; her fair Scandanavian features and lush blonde hair shining for all to see. When I looked in her eyes she was just beaming. But I left her behind, never seeing or hearing from her again.Leaving her behind isprobably the major regret of my life. My one wish in life is to have a chance to go back and do it over with her. She is without a doubt "the one."

      At the wedding I had a sick feeling come over me.  This was not  the person I wanted to spend my life with.  The sex was ok for a  few weeks.  But beyond that I can honestly say that I never felt  "in love" with the woman I've called my wife for almost 20  years.   God help me when I say this but I can definitely  relate to those who've left their lover at the altar cooling their  heels.  Even though such an incident would be a fiasco when it  happened, it would be far better than spending your life with someone you didn't love.

      Well today was another slight.  At the checkout at Hy Vee I was cashing in bottle deposit refund slips.  The girl barely said anything to me, hardly looked at me at all.  The guy behind me was a rail-thing guy with a beard.  You could see her eyes light up and hear her chatting away with him about this and that. Jesus H. Fucking Christ, can it get anymore obvious?   I had the same thing happen several years ago at the bank.  The teller was all squinty-eyed with me and curt and polite. Then a slim blonde guy behind me got to her window and she just lit up.    Some would say that I'm being too sensitive.  No I'm just good at picking up things like that, little non-verbal clues to whether they are happy to see me or are disgusted to be around me.  I don't know how many fatties are at the board.  It's just that those that've posted pics there are mostly in good height-weight proportion and some quite attractive.  And no one is sitting there hitting on me because I'm down or feeling vulnerable at times.   No one wants to be near a fat guy. I don't even bother to post a hookup thread.  Don't make me laugh.   If I were a woman or a gq guy.....................................  It's just time that I do something about this weight for more ways than just being attractive to women.   This anger I feel is what's going to drive me away from overeating and more exercise and weight loss.   Screw the fat-hating world.  But when the weight is off................................I can be as shallow as the next thin person.   I'll pick and choose as I please.   I'll also remember those who belittled me, those who rejected me.   Even a dog remembers who kicked him.   I'll carry that grudge to my grave thank you very much.  I've used food for too long as a tranquilizer, to numb the pain of an oppresive upbringing.  But do most thin people look at that?  No all they see is a fat guy.  Cancer, Aids you name the affliction,  the outpouring of sympathy is there.  But being overweight?  All they see is a person who can't control himself, a person they'd never love intimately, a person they'd never know would worship the ground they walk on.   A person who'd risk life and limb for them. But that's fine.  That's ok.  This anger, this fiery-hot rage in the bottom of my soul will see me through.  When the lard is off, fuck the world.   I want a T-shirt with a fat pic of me on the front saying, "To those who rejected me when I looked like this Go to Hell."  I really do.  That is my deepest wish.     God I hope there's sex in heaven.  I sure as hell ain't getting my share down here.

      Sometimes I don't know where to begin. I've NEVER had a relationship where I loved someone so deeply that I couldn't live without them AND have them love me back the same way. One-way romances for me. I wish I knew where to look for someone. People are alone all over the country. Why can't I meet someone who just blows me away? Isn't it my turn pretty soon? I'm just afraid that if I don't find an attractive woman who'll accept me the way I am now, after all the struggle I'm going to go through losing all this weight, I'm going to be a callous as those that reject me now. After doing all that work I'm going to feel a sense of entitlement woman-wize. Don't come to me with your kid problems, I'm out the door. Anything less than I visualize a woman to be figure wise, forget it. I'm afraid that I'll exclude just like I have been excluded. I'm going to go through hell to change myself for the better. Nothing, make that ABSOLUTELY nothing less than the ideal woman for me will do. No tradeoffs, no compromises.

      I don't know if anyone from the board actually came over here or not.  Looking back on it my decision to link it to my profile there was wrong.  This is a place where I can bitch and moan about my love life and life in general. It can get downright ugly at times, but I feel I must let it out.   It would truly poison the atmosphere if it were to be posted at another place.  I have NO animosity towards anyone there, and if that was the impression someone got if they happened to wander over here I am deeply sorry.  You're not going to see porn pics here.  No pics of people screwing; not even of me.  No erotic stories, no love poems.   Just little 'ol me ranting about my feelings of being alone in this world and having no one that I truly love.

      I know I shouldn't expect to be the life of the party.  Hell afterall I've been conditioned to "be realistic" in life.  A soft-spoken fat guy doesn't have much notoriety unless it's odd looks or pig calls behind your back, being rejected by women.   As God as my witness I'm going to lose 100 # and get the hell out of my marriage.   But the thing is I can be as cruel as those that rejected me or wouldn't even consider me as a lover.  Fuck them.  It just plays into my cynicism about the world.  A pretty face gets all the attention whether they're as dumb as a fucking pile of hog shit or not.  You know, I'm kinda glad this blog gets no attention, no comments.  Gives me a chance to say my real feelings.    If I were a reasonably attractive woman or a hot guy people would throw themselves at me.  Cry about my problems and someone would want to dry my tears. Not me.  No wonder I'm a loner.   Whatever I have in life no one has lifted a finger to help me.  No one showed me the path I should take.  I've done it ALL BY MYSELF.   No wonder I'm so good at masturbation.

      I seem to be in one of those moods again.  The realization that I'm in a marriage that is not in the least just hits me like a ton of bricks.  I've put in nearly 19 years with this woman and I don't love her.  She's not a bad person.  Quite the contrary she's a very good person.  But I cannot find the least bit of sexual desire for her and haven't for a long long time.    I just cannot forgive myself for settling for this kind of life.  I've wasted all these years with someone who's not more than a roommate to me.   I've been addicted to a new message board and post there quite a bit as a way to release some of this tension I feel.  It's theraputic in a way to reveal things to people you barely know from the 'net.    The frustrating thing for me is the fact that some there have met and actually fallen in love.  Wish lightening would strike me like that.    But what bugs me is the fact that since I'm not a woman in a shitty marriage, or a real cute guy (I suppose a 325# man is cute to some) I don't feel anyone there reaching out to me.  I know people message each other and form private offline friendships and affairs.  One woman in particular has written about her marriage being on the rocks for some time.    She's very attractive and a heart of gold.  So I know whatever guy she fell for on the board was undoubtedly one who saw that she was hurting.  He saw a vulnerable woman and formed a bond with her.   Nothing wrong with that.  But what makes me such a leper?  Why won't anyone reach out to me when I'm hurting?  Vulnerable fat guys just don't make any lady diddle their clits.  Now if I was a pinup or GQ looker, I could be silent and brooding all I wanted and women would be PM'ing me nonstop, if only just to talk.  No fucking wonder I'm a loner.  I've got a universe of love to give and no one to give it to.

      Well, Sunday out of the blue I got laid again.   "Rita" was another woman I talked to from the web.  We were just emailing back and forth getting to know each other a little when she suggested that she wanted me now, as in RIGHT now.  I said sure, I've got a bed here at work and when I'm done we can go at it.   She showed up  a little after 5 and we kissed passionately.  I pressed her against the wall dry-humping her hard, grinding my hips into hers, showing her the force of my thrusts. But that kiss was the last time she even looked at me.  When we were in bed together I had her cumming quite a number of times, orally, finger-fucking, and tit massage as well.  Even when I mounted her she had her head turned to the side, refusing to look at me.  Oh well it was just like fucking a whore, cause that's what she was.  No emotion in that cunt at all.  Hey it was an experience, a spur of the moment type of thing and in that respect it was arousing as hell.  Just meet and fuck.  Her fucking loss.
