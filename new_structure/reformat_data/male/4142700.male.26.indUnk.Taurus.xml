       SOMEBODY  depache mode   I want somebody to share, Share the rest of my life, Share my innermost thousghts, Know my intimate details Someone who'll stand by my side, And give me support, And in return, She'll get my support...  She will listen to me, When I want to speak, About the world we live in, And life in general, Though my views may be wrong, They may even be perverted, She'll Hear me out and won't easily be converted, To my way of thinking In fact she'll often disagree, But at the end of it all, She will understand me... Ahhhh....  I want somebody who cares, For me passionately, With every thought and With every breath, Someone who'll help me see things, In a different light, All the things I detest, I will almost like,  I don't want to be tied, To anyone's strings, I'm carefully trying to steer clear of Those things, But when I'm asleep, I want somebody, Who will put their arms around me And kiss me tenderly... Though things like this, Make me sick, In a case like this, I'll get away with it... Ahhh.....

      Ok, Some people may have differing opinions on this one. But what I have written is purely from my own view point and I probably need more feed back on this than I have comments for it. Well, letâs dwell on it a little longerâ¦.  Can a fully platonic relationship between a guy/man/male and a girl/woman/lady ever take place!!!??? There is a mighty fine line between romantically acquainted  friend and a truly close one. Well, I would guess some people would be able to tell apart the differences, regardless of sexual orientation. However, sometimes, this mighty thin red line is pretty confusing at timesâ¦isnât it?  How many males out there can boast that your BESTEST of best friends in actually from the female species (assuming you are permanently straightâ¦no offence to other sexually oriented beingsâ¦but it would be too tedious to include every single orientationâ¦) and if there actually is just one guy, and you do not having to eventually end up with ur bestest of best friend, could u please raise your hand? Close friends, yes, we may have a fewâ¦but to what extend is the closeness??  For the guys, I guess, the way our brain functions is more straight forward and focused. Mainly, a yes means yes and a no means no. So in relationships, we donât really operate in multi level syndrome. We may acknowledge close ties with the female species, and unless there is money involved (figure this out yourselfâ¦), to us, there is only these 3 categoriesâ¦ Friend (yes, purely nothing will develop beyond this point), potential partner and partner.  Predominantly, the females (without having gone through operationsâ¦) tend to be able to have more males surrounding them as their close friends (assuming the female specimen is of a reasonable physical appearanceâ¦regardless of the level of intelligenceâ¦). This is clear in many cases, and no doubt that they claim a close tie between the male parties involved, but to what extend this closeness is held out, does it differentiate, a romance developing and a truly close pal?  Beats me.   But I believe the female brain has the ability to operate in a multi-function mode (multi-tasking as well..). When a lady says yes, it may mean maybe, sure!, errmmmâ¦ok, no, damn it! Not now!!, good, yay! or yes. And when she says no, it may mean, maybe, common!! U know what I want!!, errrmmmâ¦ok, yes, let me think about it, just go away!!, forget itâ¦, die u #$%*ing bastard!!, or no. Arenât they wonderful...? Definitely canât live without them.   But this also brings us to the point that their exquisite ability to think on multi levels mean they probably categorize men, in terms of relationships, into several or maybe more of the following categories (I may be wrong about the categoriesâ¦but I am certain there is more than 3): Letâs start with â¦Friend type A, Friend type B, Friend type C, Friend type D, Friend type E (which explains why females have different breasts sizes as wellâ¦.), jerks, bastards, Out of my sight, ummmmâ¦.i cannot see himâ¦.ummmmâ¦.i cannot see himâ¦ummmmmâ¦.., potential partner type 1, potential partner type 2, potential partner type 3, potential partner type 4, potential partner type 5, potential partner type 6â¦.and  TA DA!!! THE ONE.  Complex, yet divine. The female species is a marvel of creation.  So, why is it, some things (in which, I mean romanceâ¦.), are so straight forward, yet soâ¦ indistinguishably complicated? We, complicate ourselves donât we? Platonic relationship, Does it really exist??...to me, a more important question would be, Platonic relationship, does it matter?... But like I always say, let nature takes its courseâ¦ What will be, will be. Sometimes, it ends the way we hope it would end, sometimes, it doesnât. So, Iâll leave u all with this quote from Katherine Hepburnâ¦   âLove has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get â Only with what you are expecting to give â which is everything.â

      Everytime she goes away, its sad to say goodbye...but still, i think i'm in the mood to sing....though my brain is hitting the negative part of the graph over these 2 days....I shall attempt a dedication...This is to GC...ha ha...(she doesn't like the publicity though...so no names for now...):    "Why do birds suddenly appear  every time you are near  Just like me, they long to be Close to you         Why do stars fall down from the skyâ¦ every time you walk by?   Just like me, they long to be Close to you   On the day that you were born the angels got together        And decided to create a dream come true            So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold                                  and starlight in your eyes of blueâ¦â¦           That is why all the boys in townâ¦ follow you all around  Just like me, they long to be Close to you  aah -aah -close to youâ¦"    song by Carpenters  but has just been sung by Marcus Chow....

      I must apologise for the long postings, especially the last post on modernity. Well, I was given that topic, faxed tome from a far away place. So, decided to do my part and gave my views on it.  I think there is an infectuos disease going on...it started with a friend who had a minor argument with her mother, soon after, Mr. B suffered a similar fate (though not as serious), then my best buddy wants to leave his home... and another friend had a little little disagreement with his mother... Then my mum came home today and went berzek!!....out of the blue. Never had I witnessed so many incidents in a short span of afew days... There is a conspiracy going on. I think the World Parent's Organization is planning something big....children, hold on tight.  Tomorrow's a better day for us all...ain't it?

      The wonderful world of technology, progress, education, evolution, fashionâ¦ associations with modernization. But the arrival of modernity, has it brought about the golden era of convenience to the human race, set about medical and technological advances and bountifully handed culture and grace to humanityâ¦or has it sharpened the edge of human evolution, making us ever more competitive and driving us further into a more oblivious set of values, dampened the human spirit of trust and honesty and sparingly making way for greater conspiracy. Modernity, with all its advantages, has definitely brought with it her cons, magnifying the human sin.  The purpose of questioning the arrival of modernity, is not to place a condemnation on her head, or crowning it in glory, but rather to find that balance. Anyway, we canât prevent progress, if thatâs what modernity is about. Personally, I feel thereâs a need for a balance of present day need for human convenience, and daily dosage of human compassion. All that we are, we were given. So, modernization will be allowed to serve its purpose, but letâs look further into the question that divides the answersâ¦modernity, friend or foe?  Throughout the ages, modernization, at each passing phase of time will be seen by the inhabitants in each reign to be most modern. But they probably had other issues to worry about, less they cared about fashion and science. There were eras of freedom, of religion, of slavery, of hope, of despairâ¦ and each era brought about somewhat, a lesson to be learned, and it progressed with each passing phase. How warfare had changed throughout history is visibly clear, and how communications had improved through the eras could not be more obvious... how each lesson in history paced the cycle of politicsâ¦changed the systems of government, and as the world constantly changes, so are her children.  There is no doubt technology has changed the face of everything. From the way we meet people, to the way we learn, to the way we do math, even in athletics(the athletes, especially runners, should just compete nakedâ¦I mean look, with all the help of new advanced suits and stuffâ¦no wonder records are being broken, I dun think thatâs being fair to past athletesâ¦but, as usual, itâs all about economics.) and to a certain extent, geography (Hasnât the world grown smaller with technology?...everyone seems to be going everywhere!! If u had to walk or swim to your destinations, I bet everyoneâs gonna stay at home.) â¦and moreâ¦ and because of technology, if ever a war breaks out, more will parish. Take WWII for example, the use of atom bombs. How many did it kill??...just two of them, compared to Napoleonâs feat at any battle field. There is no doubt, that the advancement of technology in warfare is a serious candidate for destruction, whatever the reason. No matter how specific a bullet or bomb or missile can hit, its still death to one party. And there is no need for fighting.  For one thing modernization has brought about, it is education to the people. Letâs take a look at relationships for example: In more stringent times, matchmaking by parents of two families was definitely the âIn thingâ. No one would argue with the arrangements, it was probably the only way a man was ever going to find a bride, taking into account the conservative state of mind of this ancient past. And it was like a gamble, for both bride and groom (actually, personally, even today with all our ability to pick and choose, itâs still a gamble). Even child marriages were acceptable. And imagine you being 10 and married. you could tell all your friends how much u love your husband or wife then, donât you? So, the evolution begins. Education arrives, and changes the cultures and believes of these so called backward forms of tradition. Today, we have people on speed dates, internet dating, blind dating, clubbing, pubbingâ¦etc... all kinds of ways to meet the opposite sex. Even the women are different, women want power, control, career, independenceâ¦and  children want a say at things (Using a 12 year old for an election campaignâ¦what is the USA coming to???). Education has changed humanity and the way things used to be. Slavery has been reduced to a milder form in maids and butlersâ¦and even animals have rights, now that humanity has developed compassion.  Education of the masses, an opportunity for propaganda, a revolution of the frame of mind, the tuning of brain frequency... But yet, its purpose is so intricate. To pass on knowledge and wisdom. Education in schools, is not necessarily the place where the child learn most. The child will probably remember fragments of what they were thought in schoolâ¦ some more, some less. But it is a place where the masses gather, and a place where the child will receive influence. And education IS influence. And looking at it, its where a ruling party can teach what a child needs to learnâ¦ loyalty and believes. And its possibly where terrorism gained a footing. They have their own schools, own thoughts and believesâ¦and it definitely had had influence. Be it religious schools, primary schools, secondary schools, institutions, universitiesâ¦. There will be opportunities of influence, and thatâs where those with the opportunity of having gone to school will find that we have been shaped to be of a certain mold. Obedient and Abiding.  Fashion statements are peel offs when modernity travels. Whenever time progress, new fashions will arrive and old ones set asideâ¦ only to see them returning to prosperity when the cycle of colors and trends make another turn. But is fashion of little value in evaluating weather it is of at least some form of a minute importance to the world of  modernity causing havoc or giving serenity? Fashion, in time, for as long as there was documented prove of civilization, there is fashion. Just that some fashions donât quite fit into certain eras. And it is a good way to judge the time period of a civilization, through fashion. For anything that can be told with a glance, it is fashion. It speaks volumes of the rulers of their time, our senses through the ages and agrees on the vanity of our species. It cannot escape, it will never die.  Rulers of the past have shown their power through appearance, symbols of power, through what they wear. Chinese emperors were the only ones allowed to wear the color of yellow and the Greeks of ancient Greece wanted to dress up like the Gods, which would put them on equal statureâ¦Till today, it still happens. But in another form, branding. The more expensive the brand, the more power you possessed, thatâs todayâs world. This form of worship has been passed down through the ages, so little surprise its essence lives on. The fruition of fashion has no doubt given the masses a sense of identity, a period they call their own, but has at the same time, segregated the community, to what I call, a layered society (could be why the communist made everyone wear the same thing??).  So, has modernity brought about more progress?? or has it diluted our traditions and values? Modernity, through education, had given birth to new ideas, new systems of governments, ended monarchy (not so sure about individual families thoughâ¦), and gave rise to technologyâ¦ evolution and revolutionâ¦.this is modernity. But has our values devalued through time?...with convenience, also comes reliance. And it is a fact I truly believe, that we are too reliant on machines and workers, too engulfed within our own circle of comfort. No more are we excited over little things like TV, colour TV, the stories on radio, simple cartoons ( not computer generated, 65,000 colored digitized animationâ¦rather the old onesâ¦hand drawn and colouredâ¦with simple story linesâ¦like smurf!!...), chicken on our plates ( In the past, it was a luxury to have meat on the dinner table..), a full meal...wellâ¦things we take for granted and never really appreciate.  Well, modernity definitely has brought about better living standards, but the age of invention (believed to be the 60s) is now past, and we now live a period of possibility, that is, anything is possible. But we have also dug our own grave, in that we have relied too much on the modernization of the world, and we live in a comfort zone weâll never leave. Today, I think itâs important to find that balance of convenience and tradition, of reliance and ability, because, if modernity should one day turn its back on us, thatâs when weâll realize, itâs too late.

      The timing of this entry is rather peculiar, because yesterday was National Day, not today. But this particular entry is supposedly meant for National Day, just that I wasnât that all inspired on National Day itself. The thoughts just got me now.  The island nation of Singapore, celebrating our 39th year of independence, and also PM Gohâs last before handing it to his deputy, Lee HL. The date fixated is on the 12th of Aug, which is just a couple of days away. The Independence of Singapore had been seen by the world in 1965 as a doomed separation from our northern neighbors. But our ancestral strength in dealing with adversities in times of need had shone during the most infant stages of growth in Singapore...  I would like to take this opportunity, to thank our leaders of the past, our founding fathers, and all those who have contributed to the immense growth of the Nation. A big THANK YOU for a job well done. A prosperous 39th Independence day Singapore!! (I dun really agree with the idea of wishing the nation a happy birthdayâ¦coz technically, a Birthday is not usually associated with the birth of a nation. And truth is, Singapore wasnât actually born in 1965â¦it was a Mr. Utama, who named this island long long time ago and thus it was born thenâ¦not in 1965. So 39th  birthday should be 39th independence day. Where do those organizers get their facts from??!!!)   Today, we are the all time S.E.A economic power house. And with great power, comes great responsibilityâ¦ We have invested large proportions of our taxes on technology, mainly in the science of surgery, health, R, servicesâ¦etcâ¦and the world watches as we try new techniques and new toys in the various industriesâ¦we are progress, and many times we do not disappoint.  Take Singapore pools for exampleâ¦it has definitely got a grip on technological advancesâ¦.plasma TVs for the viewing pleasure of punters, fast and reliable number generating systems... quick and easy to use computers for staffâ¦well, the list goes onâ¦ And it has reaped its profits.  Meanwhileâ¦in the dark alleys of Singapore, lies the old traditional system of betting. Bookies. Apparently, these people hardly loose, just a little busier than the rest of the players. I understand the desire for quick money and the generation of hope, the thrill of waiting for a fast buck. Coz, I was once a player. And still am in small ways. But letâs dig into a more specific area. Soccer betting. I believe even before the days of the Quah brothers or Uncle Chooâ¦soccer betting had already existed. And it was carried by the bookies then. I think having the resilience of cockroaches helps in the survival of this old trade of bookieing, because, until today, they are still alive.  I think itâs a temptation to be playing with a bookie, because u actually place a bet without even using a single cent!!! Of course, when u loose, they come after you with many a doctor octopus. And I have personally witnessed the downfall of some who were drowned by the tentacles of this path they chose.   I believe u can never actually earn anything from betting soccer, or betting as a whole within our entire lifetime. Reasons are, 1) when u win, u spend your winnings. 2) when you loose, you loose your own savings. 3) If you do win and you donât spend the winnings, itâs probably because you used it to clear old debts.  Itâs a super micro minority that actually make a profit in their entire lifetime of betting. Imagine the amount of money you safe when you actually donât bet and put that supposedly betting money in the bank. But, its greed that drives todayâs society. So, hereâs good luck to all those who are still in the game.  The power of technology. How wonderful. So much so, todayâs odds and winning numbers are so easily available - through the internet, sms, radio, teletextâ¦.etc. No wonder so many are drawn ever closer towards betting. And who ever invented 4D and TOTO is a genius (And probably a Singaporean), with a much greater brain than Ben Franklin or Einstein.  Singapore, as a nation, however, has a long and winding road ahead. A new form of leadership is at hand to spur the country to even greater heights. Much to look forward to, and the fear of our nation rising beyond its current state of affairs and humility has been sensed by the rest of the world. Chinaâs reaction to DPM LHLâs visit to Taiwan is a good example, which eventually halted the talks for new trade agreements between our small island and the dragon of Asia. This incident has shown the mediocre mind set of the dragon, and it will forever remain asleep if it doesnât want to see things on a bigger scale of benefit and dwell in its stunted frequency of thought.  The 39th year of Singaporeâs independence is a significant year. The recovering economy, the change in leadership, the swelling rate of punters, the justification of election promises, the learning and understanding of the national anthem (finally the government realizes the lack of understanding by Singaporeans of the national anthem...they had actually put down the meanings of the lyrics in the opening and closing songs on TVâ¦good start. But I think Singaporeans should initiate knowing what the anthem actually meansâ¦more on this another day...)â¦and much moreâ¦will determine the next move we make as a nation and the direction the new cabinet will lead us charging towards. Till then, we look forward to our 40th year of independence.

        Migration, why do people do it? Would you like to migrate one day? In Singapore, based on personal observations and conversations, many would actually like to give this issue a thought, and some even announce their undulating desire to leave the country. But the questions we ask ourselves is why? And it may even answer many other questions that has been in the wings for a long timeâ¦   For me, my personal view on leaving the country isnât as simple as leaving everything behind, and starting anew. Itâs more to that. But like many others, we cannot help but allow ourselves to open up options of a better life, and migration, could be one of the answers.  Singapore is definitely an attractive place for business dealings, for large co-operations to set up HQs for the ASEAN or Asian region because of our God given geographical advantage and our ability to handle multiple tasks and languages without much difficulties, not to mention the worldâs leading producer of management products from our management schools of which little are leading the top co-operations who still rely on foreign expertiseâ¦but itâs definitely not attracting people from Europe to migrate, at best a few who had found their other significant half here who happens to be Singaporeans, born and bread on this land. Else, with all due respect, a handful of aspiring young and supposedly talented athletes, a large chunk of china and some pieces from the other parts of the world, have decided to settle here and make this country their home.  Is Singapore turning stale? Probably not the physical appearance of  the country or her people, or her lack of world class beauties (Gosh, look at who represents us at the Miss Universe Contests!! My!! even our northern neighbors made it to the final 3 before!! And our eastern ones winning the competition!!) or the increase demands for donations to charities (I have reason to believe that organizers for charity events actually earn part of the proceeds, good if its just to cover costs, but to be making a profit?â¦I suppose there should be a revision to the meaning of the word âcharityâ? I mean, a cash reward for donating money!!??? Common, Whereâs the moral logic??!!) or the food or the issues on waterâ¦But maybe, her Life-Style.   In my humble opinion, itâs common for someone wanting to take life easy, regardless the age. Easy as in, not lazy, but working and enjoying the free time available, not rushing for competitiveness, or for that promotion, but taking things slowly. And using all my spider senses, in Singapore, I dun think thatâs very viable. Letâs take a peep. Zooming into the life of a new born, assuming itâs a typical Singaporean familyâ¦. The 1st 6 years of Angelineâs life, she spends learning, mimicking everything her parents do, meanwhile, because other kids are developing their talents early, like dance or piano or some form of sport, she starts karate lessons at the tender age of 4â¦along the way, she gets a brother (who eventually, turns out to be her punching bag she loves dearly).  Then she turns 7 and starts Primary one after exhaustive registration procedures. For the next 6 years, sheâs stuck in school, learning Math, Chinese, English and general Science, preparing herself for her 1st big test, the PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination, probably, the only certificate she spends 6 years preparing forâ¦) Then after all her hard work, she progresses on to a secondary schoolâ¦  Her hormones starts to evolve, and sheâs still gonna be stuck in school again for another 4 years. She starts the process all over again, this time with 8 subjects to study, Math, Science, Literature, Geography, English, Chinese, Principles of Accounts and Boys. After a vigorous 4 years filled with danger and excitement, she graduates, passing 7 of the 8 subjects and chooses to go to a polytechnic, a good choice in Ngee Ann Poly. She spends another 3 Years in school. While this time, the fees are so significantly higher, her parents slog that little bit harder to pay her school fees and prepare themselves for her next phase. The day she graduates, her parents are overjoyed, but they know more is to comeâ¦.she selects a university of her choice and continues her studies for a further 3 years, mean while, on her final year of study, her brother got married due to an accident while studying overseas.  She comes home with a degree after finally slogging on 16 years of education. While she searches for a job, she canât remember a single thing she studied over the past 16 years, and though some view it as a waste of time and money, she DID come back with a piece of paper certifying her credentials, and eventually got herself a job as a clerk in a world leading, universal domineering, sound barrier breaking organization.  She slogs for the next 40 years of her life, eventually falling ill on her 65th birthday where she uses all her savings to pay for her own illness. And her possible final words were:â Dame!! I should have died earlier, so I donât have to spend all my money on medication and surgery, and donate it to a charity.â God bless her.   So, as we see, though not fully typical of the life of a typical Singaporean, but the essence of this story is for all to see and reflect. The gees of the story also tell tales of Singaporeans who have studied so hard throughout the years, yet achieving nothing of significance eventually. Of course, I am not saying that everyone is, Iâm just suggesting that most are. Not that education is not necessary, to me, education IS important and I will never stop my child from pursuing his studies, if he chooses to. But our culture has developed in such a way that risk taking is not an option, and the government recognizes this and has emphasized more on entrepreneurship since. So, is this the life most of us seek? Pampered and sheltered? All planned and ready? Predictable? And maybe thatâs why life style in Singapore appears to be turning staleâ¦ and in singlish, WAH LIAOZ! No wonder the birth rate is fallingâ¦.   I have known people who have thought of migrating because of the rigid education system in Singapore, where a child is not being developed based on his strengths, but being punished for his weaknesses (which the government is at last putting their foot forward regarding this issue, but as it is, is only a foot, at least itâs still progress). There are even thoughts of migration because of the lack of opportunities in this little island, too many red tapes, and everythingâs about money (well, at least corruption is kept at a  distinct distance away from public eyes)â¦etcâ¦  But I suppose there must be a basis in which we make our judgments. Something we learned either through vocal transmissions or from experiencing it ourselves, and this allowed us to form a status quo in our minds, something that we use to compare our decisions with. Example; if someone had lived, letâs say in England for 5 years, comes back and says he dislikes Singapore and wants to migrate one day because of various reasonsâ¦the probability is that he has formed a comparison chart in his mind, sub-consciously comparing life in England, to that of in Singapore, thus giving him an opportunity to dismiss his roots and residing a desire to go to another land.  But if the same person had, in all grace, lived in the neither regions of Zimbabwe, then, maybe, he would have chosen to return permanently to Singapore. I am sure, those Singaporeans caught in the time of war, will have a far greater passion other than migrating. And they were our ancestors. If my ancestors had decided to flee to somewhere else after WW II, I would have ended up somewhere in the middle of the south china sea.  Bottom line is, everyone wants to have a better life style, a place for retirement. Weather this place is in the land of your birth, or an adopted country, its entirely up to you. But our roots are important and like our traditions, must be remembered. Because the future generations will look back in history, and regard us as their pride, as their ancestors.

      With regards to matters of the heart, I guess youâll only go as far as someone allows you to go. 2 hands to clap. Matters of the heart, yes, an ancient disease, where modern philosophies have changed certain aspects of the game. Love the woman you marry, or marry the woman you love? Some would of course, be able to do both or at least want to.  But I donât think there is justice when it involves the heart. Your devotion and patience, your efforts, may not even be appreciated. No matter what you do, you MAY NOT even come close. Hey, everyone gets to pick and choose, some more than others. Minus the ones who have dedicated their life to single hood, or have greater callings, the rest of the gang would actually be facing such adversities, and there is nothing they can do, but try.  Here comes the next big thing. Courage. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to overcome fear. And it takes courage to actually face rejection in the face, or the prospect of rejection. Courtship is definitely an old tradition, and an instinct in many ways. Some are longer, some are shorter, some end happy, some end sad, and some never ends, and some are given up. Hereâs cheers to all those who have actually decided to make the 1st move. Kudos to You! Of course, youâll have to meet someone 1st.  I donât think I am actually in a position to comment on such matters myself, but just giving my few cents worth. We may wait our entire life just to meet that special someone. Sometimes, some are luckier than others and sometimes, they donât appearâ¦but an experience in the past has taught me that, regardless of the timing, once you have met that one person you know, you simply know, that everythingâs right, that sheâs the one, then this is the time you must not give her up. (I have been fortunate enough to be given a second chance, so weâll have to see where it goes from here...) But definitely, it takes 2 hands to clap.  A little insanity would help along the way I guess. The crazy things that we do when we are in loveâ¦And, thatâs the magic of it allâ¦.how sheâs engraved in your mindâ¦how she changes your soul, how she makes you see the worldâ¦all of a sudden, everything seems so clearâ¦the airâs fresher, the skies are bluerâ¦and you are truer to yourself than at any other times. Itâs really a blessing.   And yeahâ¦Iâm in love.

       I was talking to friend yesterday regarding my post on FATE and FAITH and we had a resonably fruitful discussion. However, his thick skull is probably why he can pack so much unneccessary stuff in his head without it bursting. But he IS someone I respect, and admire to a certain extent, however different our opinions are. (Note: Some of us actually believe he will be ordained.)   Actually, being catholic, there is a set of catholic doctrines to determine what the church can and cannot do. The believe that there is no such thing as fate, but there is the existence of Godâs plan sounds contradicting and beyond logic. But that is precisely what it is, beyond logic. And by all means, only God understands, not us, puny humans, with our linear understanding of logics.  So I guess, I AM human, and that explains my last post on FATE and FAITH.

          "He is half part of a blessed man, Yet to be finished by such a she... She is a fair divided excellence, whose fullness of perfection lies in him."   - William Shakespear  I think this is beautiful. There is nothing like embracing the air of what people want to say, allowing the full blast of emotion into our blood. In these words of what Shakespear had said, there is a sense of eternity. Fate had brought 2 people together. This is in relation to the romantic side of fate. And I believe, that there will always be 2 people in this world, fated to meet, and some will progress furtherâ¦coz they were fated for one another.  I feel that fate, is of time. Because only time will tell. But does each and everyone of us have our own destiny and prophecies to full fill? What's mine? What's yours? and who in this world told you that things must be done a certain way or that you were meant to do certain things? Or that you'll never find romance? Or you'll never be able to do what you dream? There are options, and there will always be options. That means we, have choices. The freedom of choice. It's weather we pursue, or we overlook. But still, only time will tell.  Do you stand by the side when you see someone in need of help?...Has it degraded to such a case whereby the government has to stand up and actually have a campaign for such acts? - the 'one deed one lifetime', Paying it forward...and i bet, some wise guy had this idea of adopting the campaign after watching the movie... Not that the idea's bad, in fact some charity probably benefited from it...but doesn't it take fate to actually allow you to meet someone you can help? And when that time comes, its time to make your choice.  Today's world is such that economics run everything. Yes, everything. Personally, I am disgusted by it. Other than the small fact that Chelsea is trying to buy the premiership crown with Mr. Abramovichâs Billions without actually considering any financial shortfallsâ¦(not that I actually approve of it)â¦but we can see from this example, 2 sides of the story. 1st, Having financial supremacy is of coz a wonderful thing. U can make many people happy, or sad. Which is probably why many have dug in towards this pathâ¦ 2nd, the spirit of achieving a dream, a goal or simply to help to the best of our ability, be it a game or an ambition, even to the extent of knowing failure is aheadâ¦is amiable. And this spirit, should at least take some precedence over everyday life in everyone. A little courage and kindness. The rest of society is purely ran by the formula of economics. Of course, donât take it personally, but wealth is not necessarily everything. But it is importantly essential. Even in religious organizations these days. At least thatâs how I see it working.  Fate is one thing, Faith another. But how they are so intimately intertwined is excruciatingly intricate. Fate is what will happen, the future, the next step in time. And faith, the belief and believe. The present, that will lead you that future. So, In my own observation and thoughts, I have come to believe that these 2 cannot be separated. Because the former is an onset of the latter. Fate cannot exist without faith. People from different schools of thought may differ, but to me whatâs important is that we have faith in something. Faith in our future, faith in our family, faith in someoneâ¦anything and maybe even blind faith, the faith of GOD. Only when we can start to have faith, can we truly appreciate our fate.  No one knows what God has planned for us. But what we do know, is living each day to the best of our ability and our hearts. Of coz it would be nice to have that special someone around... But it's God's plan, we can only ask for his guidance and help, and as we all know, it will take faith. Because, like what a close friend told me long ago...faith is believing in what you cannot see, the reward of faith, is seeing what you believe. And I believed him.  The lives of many differ. But what has given the weak strength, is their faith, and who are those who have lost their own feet... allowing their blooming pessimism to grow?....those who have lost faith in themselves and the people around them. And that is why they do not appreciate the things that were given to them, and that is why these things were taken away. There is a reason why events occur or accidents happenâ¦or your dog ate your winning toto ticketâ¦ or your beloved boy/girl friend left youâ¦or vice versaâ¦even your overlooked promotionâ¦or even your promotionâ¦.or you meeting that special someoneâ¦or you helping a complete strangerâ¦well, what ever it is, God had allowed these things to happen, good or bad in your eyes, because he has allowed your faith to see you through something better or worst, and that you will eventually be fated for something greater.
