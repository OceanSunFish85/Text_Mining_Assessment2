      So I hadn't gotten three steps away from the kid when Ellen called. She was real excited about the job she'd done on the folks. I'm willing to bet she was doing her stupid little victory dance while she talked to me. Ellen can be a little unprofessional, but we overlook it because she's good - about as good as they come. I was sure she'd do fine with the girl's parents, but that doesn't mean she'd be happy about it. So I got it out of the way pretty fast. Told her there was a complication; tried to explain, but of course she wouldn't hear it. "And there was no way you could have caught him alone!?! Greg, you moron, she could cause big waves. Suppose she goes and tells her parents, or the cops. Do you know who's gonna have to put out these fires, Greg? I'll give you a hint, it isn't you!" "Actually," I cut in, "I thought you could start on the fire thing now. We need to get to her parents somehow. You got the database handy?" "Yes," she seethed. "Same high school as Ian, first name Scarlett." "There's two." "Check the mugs. Red hair, she has a mole on her cheek." "Got it. I have tickets to a show tonight. If I miss it you're paying." Click. Well I looked at Marcus, and he looked at me and he finally said, in the stupid question of the year, "How'd it go?" "Well how'd you think it went? She's ballistic, but she'll be over it in an hour. We got anybody else on the list?" "Chip's taking care of the other guy, so that just leaves one thing." "Who? Where? I need the data man." And then he stopped walking. He looked at me in a funny way and he said. "Look, Greg, This is weird, but, it's you." "I'm being recruited?" "Yep." "But I'm a recruiter!" "Yep." "WHAT!?!" "C'mon Greg, you fit the profile. Dissatisfied with your job, but out of other options, little to no social life, --" "But I've already done this! It didn't work the first time! If this is your idea of a joke." "Greg, this is right from the top, you  will  be a recruit on this mission," he said gravely, "Here's your time and place. Don't wear the suit." And we just stood there, he and I. I couldn't believe this. Me. Recruited. Geez.

      I checked the piece of paper that I clutched in my hand. Six o'clock, it said, at 1437 Dunhill. Pretty spiffy, I thought to myself. Dunhill is the biggest street in town. Big office towers, huge shopping malls, even some luxury condos. I figured this orginization had to be something big.  As I neared the address, I stopped the cab and paid the driver. Not exactly a small thing. Cabs aren't getting any cheaper. I sighed and handed over more than half the money in my wallet. When I turned around, purse on my shoulder and small duffel bag in my hand, I saw thatI was in front of 1429 Dunhill. I continued down the street, staring up at the tall buidings that surrounded her. 1431, 1433, 1435... I stopped in front of number 1437 and blinked. Twice. Then did a double take. Number 1437 Dunhill was a number on a stick. And not one of those fancy plaques either. No, it was a piece or wod with the numbers "1,4,3,7" written on in permanent marker. Ok, I thought, now what? After I had finished oggling at the wood on a stick, I realized that behind the sick, there was an alley. A dark, spooky, wet alley. Great, I thought, I'm going to ruin my shoes. Now, before you say, 'Why is she thinking about her shoes? She's about to go on a wild and exciting adventure!' You must realize that these were very good shoes. We're talking, a 600 dollar pair of shoes (that I got on sale for $150) that would now be ruined because of a stupid mission. Oh well, what the heck? Toward the middle of the alley, there was a small door, rusty, metal door. I started towards, it but didn't get more that three steps before I heard a splash behind a dumpster right in front of me. Immediately, I tensed up. Being a single girl, I had invested in self defence classes. I put my bag down on a semi-dry patch of concrete.  No sooner had I turned than someone jumped out at me. A man dresed in black, ninja-style. How original. I made short work of him. A swift kick in the groin took care of him. As he lay on the ground, I wacked him on the back of the head, causing him to lose conciousness. Another guy tried to sneak up on me, but sonn he was lying beside his friend. The third man was a little more difficult. He actually knew a little bit about martial arts. He attacked me from the side, hitting me hard. As I lay on the ground, the wind knocked out of me, he stood back and did the whole, macho deal. Unforetunately for him, he forgot I was lying within kicking distance. Bye bye number three. I picked up my bag, satisfied that no one else was going to attack me, and headed for the door. AS I openned the door, I heard someone from inside say, "Very good, Ms Taylor. Please step inside." I stepped into an ankle-deep puddle.  Bye-bye $600 shoes.

      Well, heres another one. Could be different, but I doubt it. I've been watching this group atleast as long as the recruiters, if not longer. It's getting easy to figure out who they're going for next; the pattern is the same everytime. The kid with something to prove, the kid with nothing to lose, the occasional unplanned for follower, sometimes more. Funny, it happens often enough one would think it wouldn't cause a problem anymore. Still, they stick to their rules, I stick to mine. Sort of...

      My mind is a constant jumble, really,but two major lines of though werelobbying for position as I watched the men disappear into the crowd. First, I had been given the opportunity to finally make something of myself, and Scarlett had had to go and be nosy and ruin it for me. That was thepart of me that was dreading spending this much time with her, so close, yet so far away. Being with her was just bad for me. The other part, the part that was making me stare at her butt as I thought, was saying that maybe this was the opportunity I'd been hoping for, to prove to her that I was a 'real' man. You know, good for something besides talking to. I could just see it - I would save her life, she'd fall into my arms - only no. It probably wasn't even real.  Scarlett said something, interupting my train of thought.  "Huh?" I said, "Sorry, I wasn't really listening,"  "I said that was really weird. Who do think they were?" she asked.  "I suppose we'll find out tomorrow at 6 pm," I said looking down at the slip of paper. "Can you get there, or do you want me to pick you up?"  Scarlett looked shocked for a moment. "You're not actually think about going, are you?" she asked.  I was a little surprised; I thought she knew me better than that.  "That's what I said."  "Ian, are you insane?" A few people turned to look. "You don't know who they are! They could be kidnappers! Lord knows what kind of ransom your grandpa would pay for you. I really think this is a bad idea,"   Then why did you agree to it?  I thought. That's the problem with Scarlett. Well, one of many problems. She's impulsive. She's also paranoid, but only after she's made a mistake. It makes for an annoying combination. I remember once in eighth grade we were at an amusement park and she decided to go on this big tube slide, you know, the kind with the big inflatable rafts? It had been raining on and off all day, so there was barely any line. Anyway, we were in the raft when she realized she really wasn't dressed for a water ride. Of course by that time it was too late. She was cold and wet the rest of the day, and none of us enjoyed the ride because she was complaing the whole time about getting her clothes wet. That was kind of off topic, but the point is, Scarlett isn't good at planning things out. She acts on her feelings without thinking first. I'm very surprised no guys have taken advantage of that.  Anyway, back to what I was saying. The problem here was that she was right. I had absolutely no reason to trust these people. Nothing but a gut feeling. Was that feeling really worth the risk? Of course not!  But then if I'd ever put logic before feelings, Scarlett wouldn't even be a part of my life right now.  "No one's making you go," I finally said. "But this is my desicion; and I, for one wanna see what it's all about,"  "I'm going with you then," she answered. "I'm your friend and I'm gonna stick by you in this. But maybe we can take some sort of safety measure. Call the police, or get-"  "No!" I interupted her. For some inexplicable reason, her perfectly reasonable lack of trust in these random people was making me mad. Looking back it may have been a jealousy thing; you know, like 'how come you can think straight and I can't?'. All I know is, I snapped.  "Look," I said, "You can go, or you can stay, I don't care. But don't try anything like that. It's..." I honestly couldn't think of a reason. "It's justnot gonna end well," I finally settled for.  She just looked shocked for a minute, then the impulsiveness kicked in again.  "Ok," she said "I'll see you there,"  Then she turned for the door.

      "Let me put it this way, Mr. Wallace."  Ha! I'd been working on that in front of my mirror all morning. I could tell by the looks on their faces that they were sufficiently intimidated by my all-black clothing ensemble, dark sunglasses, and serious expression. I'd been working on them all morning, too. I took a moment to hope that I'd remembered to unplug my hair straightener; the last thing I needed was another small house fire. Then I continued, keeping my voice completely level.  "Let me put it this way for you, Mr. Wallace. Did you ever want to be in the CIA or the FBI when you were a little boy, sir?"  "Yeah, sure."  "Well, you couldn't."  "I couldn't?" He was curious, and slightly offended.  "No."  "Why not?"  "Because this is how we pick them."  Significant pause.  I'd put a lot of weight on the words, because a big impression was vital at this point. What I had just told the Wallaces was a complete lie, but it was a good one. It tended to work on big men with mustaches like Mr. Wallace. Mrs. Wallace didn't look like she'd object to anything much. The FBI and the CIA were bumbling morons and I had nothing to do with them, but the important thing was what I could make the Wallaces believe.  I hated this part.  I'd considered a number of options in speaking to Ian Wallace's parents. Not the least of them was perhaps slipping a note under the door. This way worked, though. They bought it, hook, line, and sinker. They signed the papers; I was out of there.  Before I walked out the front door, I handed them a card. "My name is Ellen Leigh. This is where you can reach me."  My mouth was already twitching as a I said it. The moment the door closed I broke into a wide grin that quickly turned into a delighted laugh. I skipped over to my car, a black Mustang whose name was Sally, and slapped her on the hood.  "Yes! Yes!" They bought it. I sighed and allowed myself a momentary bask in my triumph. It was my first mission as a senior officer. I was pretty much the foremost field agent on the trip. For the first time, I had two suits working under me.  Ooh. That sounded dirty.  I slipped into the car and dialed on my cell phone.  "Greg? It's Ellen. I got 'em, baby. Oh, wait! Sorry. Unprofessional. Um, the parents are on board. Repeat, the parents are on board." As I listened, the grin faded from my face. "What kind of complication?"

      So, as I was saying, Marcus and I got to the mall after a couple more conversational dead ends and started looking for this Ian guy. Marcus showed me the pic. A kid, blonde, 5' 10', acne troubles.  "Little young, isn't he?" I asked Marcus. He just shrugged. That Marcus.  So after some walking we got lucky. I caught a girl's voice saying "Ian." Followed the noise with my eyes and I saw him. Also saw her, and she was quite a looker. Brilliant red hair.  "Look at that, he's got a girl. Candidates are necessarily single, aren't they?," asked Marcus.  "Look how he's trying not to look at her, not to talk to her. They're not together. My guess is she's an ex, and he still loves her, and she's got no idea."  "You got all that out of -"  "Oh c'mon. Let's help him out of a tough spot."  See, Marcus thinks I'm an idiot because I talk too much. I'm smart, though, I notice things. My favorite job is picking out the recruitees in the first place. These recruiting rounds are just depressing. I motioned to Marcus to start it off.  "Ian Wallace?" he asked.  "Yeah," the kid said, startled, "That's me."  "We'd like to talk to you alone for a few minutes."  He started to say sure, but the girl cut in.  "Don't go with them, Ian. You don't know who these people are. Whatever it is they can tell us."  "No, ma'am," I said, "We can't. Ian has been handpicked for a special mission. If we allow you to hear anything, you'd have to accompany him."  "Ok," she said. She just wanted to win. She didn't know what she was agreeing to.  "It might mean giving up your whole life as you know it, for an indeterminate amount of time."  I remember when I first started, I said "For God knows how long." Boy did I get chewed out for that.  "If Ian here'll do it, I'll do it," she said firmly.  "I'll, um, meet you guys by the Frullati," said the other boy.  Well, Marcus was looking at me questioningly, cause I've got seniority and this was my call. I knew that if my hunch was right, recruiting her wouldn't make his life any better, but then that's not our job. Well, it sort of is, but anyway I decided it was my best bet to not try and argue with her, or else I might come off as the bad guy.  "Ian," I asked, "What do you want to do with your life, what's your asperation?"  "I want to be a sculptor. Of junk," he said uneasily.  "You think there's money in that?" I asked, evenly, emotionlessly.  "Not really. I mean, maybe, if I'm good."  "Are you?" asked Marcus.  The girl again, "He's wonderful!"  "They fall apart," he contradicted, "Even when I hot glue them, they fall apart. The masters weld, but that's no good for the plastics and cardboard. I- I see a whole new art form, but unless I can bond it better, no one would buy it."  "We'd like to offer you the opportunity to participate in a mission to protect your country, world, and way of life. The risk to your life is minimal, but you will be gone for some time. The position is unpaid."  "Then why would anyone do this?" asked the girl, crossing her arms.  "Ian knows," I replied, "And it's up to him."  The kid had a thoughtful look on his face. We watched and waited for a few seconds.  "C'mon, Ian," she said finally, "Let's go meet Jason."  "No," he said quietly, then louder, "I'll go."  "Here are the time and place of your meeting. Show them to no one, pack only what you need. We've already sent someone to explain the situation to your parents; no one else needs to know."  "I'll be there," he said, uneasily, but happily.  "So will I," said the girl, glaring at me.  They ran off. When Ellen got back from talking to Mr. and Mrs. Wallace, I was gonna have to send her to this girl's folks. I'd also have to explain to her why I'd recruited a non-candidate. I was in some deep... trouble.

      As soon as I said the words "Why not?" the smaller recruitment officer's face twitched a bit. Part of my brain recognized that he was suppressing laughter. At my expense. But the rest of my brain overided this thought almost immediately, so I didn't dwell on it. I learned long ago that what my brain overrides, I don't want to know anyway. So I moved on.  The smaller man got a hold of himself and handed me a bunch of papers. "This is the time and place of our next meeting. Be there with only the things that are necessary." Then they walked out of the Starbucks and drove away in a black jaguar. Nice car.  I finished my chai tea and walked out onto the street. Suddenly the world looked different to me. I had a purpose now. No more boring Gillian, who brings Jim his coffee every morning. I'm a new woman, I told myself, I should act like one.  I straightened up, and walked purposefully down the street. I got about five steps before my heel hit a pothole, causing me to fall on my face in a not-so-graceful way. Relax, I told myself, More Queen Elizabeth, less Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality.  As I set off again, I wondered about what this mission was about. Was it a secret government conspiracy? A mad scientist testing out time travel? Or did the Matrix truly exist? I hope it's the third one, I thought, I want a long black leather coat. Plus working with Keanu Reeves wouldn't be too bad either.  Well, I said to myself, let's see how deep this rabbit hole goes.

      Ok. The beginning. I guess it all started when I let Jason convince me to go to the mall. Now let me just say so you'll know - I hate malls. I like hardware stores. Not malls. Gaggles of giggly girls everywhere, standing around talking about the clothes they just bought, looking pretty and not looking at me. I know there are all kinds of stores, but I prefer to go to those outside the mall, the ones that don't leave me feeling lonely and depressed. Not that I really care what these girls think. I don't. But every so often I see one with red hair, and she'll remind me of Scarlett. And I couldn't have that. Not when I was so close to getting my life together.  Sorry, I'm getting off track. Anyway, Jason wanted me to come with him to an electronics store in the mall to look at some gadget he wanted. Since I'm the "rich" one, he figures I can afford to get him one for his birthday. Truth be told, I probably could. Mygrandpa owns ... most of the city. My Dad won't accept any money from him, so I take it myself behind his back. I want for nothing, dad still feels like he's being defiant, and no ones the wiser. Sorry, off track again. Anyway, I walk in the door and who should I see but, yup, you guessed it, Scarlett. I didn't feel like plunging into another six months of depression, so I decided to avoid eye contact and walk briskly past. Well, Jason ruined that plan.  "Hey Scarlett!" he says. She turns to look at us. Scarlett is named for her hair. Beautiful, flaming red hair. Down to her butt. Gets me every time. She stares at me and its like I can't move. I can't do anything but look at her.  "Hey Jason!" she starts. Then she sees me. "Ian?" she says. She runs up and hugs me. It's too late now. Another month of therapy down the drain. "I've been trying to get in touch with you all summer! Did you change your phone number or something? And your e-mail? And I don't think I had your IM right. It's junkmaster06, isn't it?"  "Yeah" I say. Now what? I can't tell her I've been avoiding her. I can't lie with Jason right there. I closed my eyes and prayed for some sort of distraction. Well, I guess someone up there likes me cause that's exactly when the men in black showed up.

      "Sure," the woman asked, "Why Not?"  Why Not! Why not indeed. It was all I could do not to laugh. Well, that's a lie. I'm virtually incapable of laughter or expressing any emotion when I'm wearing the suit. Years as a recruitment officer does that to you. If any of them could see me at home, with Fluffy, they'd never believe it was me.  Anyway, we gave her the papers, the time and place, and got back in the car (black of course).  "Where to next?" I asked my partner, Steve or Sven or Marcus or whoever was with me that day. (One of the guys for sure, but on the job we all act alike.)  "Guy named Ian Wallace, should be at the mall."  "Great. Maybe we'll have time to go shopping."  He didn't answer. I think it was Marcus. Guy has no sense of humor. I mean, none of us are supposed to, but I've never even seen Marcus laugh off duty. We drove on silently for a while, but I hate long conversationless pauses. This never was my dream job. I'm not cutout for this work. But then, none of us are. The Recruiters are the leftovers. The people who really did have nothing to lose. Most people; finish their mission, have some epiphany and they know what they want to do with their life. We're the ones who finished our mission and still couldn't find anything else. Except Marcus. I really think Marcus likes it.  Anyhow, I said to Marcus, to break the silence,  "What's with all the black anyway? Why do we have to look like we just walked out of the Matrix to be recruiters?"  "You know why," he replied boredly, "We can't standout in any way. The recruitee's decision must be based on their own desperate situation, not on impressions of us. We must-"  "Be totally emotionaless, personalitiless, and uninteresting," I finished for him, "I know the creed, but I still think we could be uninteresting in something more comfortable."  He didn't answer again. It was definitely Marcus. What a piece of work.

      I should have said no. It would have been so easy just to open my mouth and say loudly and clearly; "NO! I don't want to! It's too dangerous! I don't want any part of this!" But of course, being me, I didn't. I said; "Sure, why not? What have I got to lose?"  Well for one thing, I had the three packets of raspberry jam, sitting in my pocket. They were there because they reminded me of my mother. She alwaysused to tellme, "Don't go anywhere without a packet of jam. You never know when you'll need one."  I realize now that I was only theOCD talking. But still, I like to keep a part of her near me all the time. Which is why I always carry around jam. It is the only thing in my life that I've got to lose.  The rest of my life sucks.  I've got the worst job on the face of the planet. I'm a secretary to the most disorganized man on the planet. That's not what it says on my business card, but that is essentially what my job is. Don't get me wrong; Jim can be a great guy... if you're tall, blond, and beautiful. I would love to tell you that I'm all of these things, but the truth is, I'm none.  Which is probably why I have no love life. My last date was four years ago. I should ask my friends if they would set me up on a blind date, I'm that desperate, but I'd have to find some friends first.  All of these factors combined to bring me to the decision that I had nothing to lose. Which is why, yesterday, when the recruitment officers came up to me on the street, and asked me to come with them, I didn't really care what happened to me. They were, big, like six feet tall, and they were wearing black suits. They told me, "You have been selected for a dangerous mission. You may risk your life at some point during the mission. Will you accept to undergo this mission?"  "Wait a minute," I said, "Why did you pick me? What redeeming qualities do I have?"  "That is not important at this time," the bigger recruitment officer said, "just answer the question, yes or no."  I contemplated my options. If I said no, I would go back to my normal, boring, friendless, boyfriendless, mind numbingly boringlife. If I said yes, my life would change and possibly be, dare I say it, exciting.Unwillingly, my mind jumped to The Matrix  andsuddenly I was 8-year-old Gillian, eager to go on adventures in made-up places, never thinking about the costs.  "Sure, why not?" I said out loud, "What have I got to lose?"

      What's on my glasses? Is that Jam? How did it get there? I don't eat jam. Man, this is weird. Jam on my glasses........... hmm...Maybe itgot there when I was running from the Rhino. Or was it earlier, on the Motorcycle ride over?But then why wouldn't I have noticed it before? Could I have gotten it in the future? Do I even say that, or should it be "will I get it in the future?". Time travel is so confusing. It doesn't matter. I knew I shouldn't have trusted those recruitment officers. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be horribly confused. Perhaps I shouldjust start at the beginning........

      I didn't have to go. No one gets forced to be recruited, and you're always allowed to turn down the mission. Of course, I've never seen it happen since I started. Y'know why? Cause we pick 'em with care. We don't just take any Tom, Dick, or Harry who seems unhappy. We pick the ones who need us, and the ones we need. And they always say yes. Well, I was gonna show em. I was about to call Marcus and say, "I'm not going." But as it went through my head, I knew that wasn't an option. I was too proud of the system to be the first breakdown of it. My victory this once would be a failure of my last seven years. So I figured I'd do it. How hard could it be? Well, for one, I didn't figure on Gillian recognizing me. I hadn't even worked out what to say. I figured, as we'd always been taught, that my whole identity disappeared when I put on the suit. Sweater-greg would be a totally different guy. But I guess I had done this so long that I was suit-Greg even in a sweater. And then when she asked me if I was one of those guys, I should have said no. Should have said "Of course not!" But something made me tell her the truth. After all, they'd all find out sooner or later. The only way to turn this insult into a victory was to wear it with pride. I decided then and there that I wasn't gonna let Ellen laugh at me again. I'm here because I want to be, I thought, and I'm no worse for not being in a suit. A heck of a lot more comfortable. So that's why, when we heard the slam, I said "I'll take care of it, Ellen, keep briefing them." I figured she'd nod me on, I'd get the kid out, and we'd be fine. But everyone was being difficult. First off, the tagalong (You know who I mean) starts yelling "What's going on? Where's Ian? What happened to him? Is he ok?" And Ellen says to me at the same time, "Greg, you're just a recruit now let me -" Well, I wasn't gonna take that. "Just a recruit?" I says, "JUST A RECRUIT? I get one lousy note and you can forget seven years? I'm not Greg anymore, I'm just a recruit? Well it doesn't work that way! You can take the recruiter out of the suit, but you can't take the suit out of the recruiter!" And then I just left. Well, Scarlett's still yelling, Gillian's just standing there confused, Ellen's chasing after me, Marcus and Steve show up and start trying to explain things, and all hell's basically broken loose already. Well, I wasn't gonna let it stop me. I went to the maze room like we always do when- well let me back up. The door Ian went in is a funny kind of door. It only shows up when the time for the meeting has expired, and it's mainly for unwanted visitors. Well, the ninjas are for unwanted visitors, the real door is for wanted visitors, and this one is for everyone else. They open it, see whatever it is that will make them leave,and then leave. For most it's an empty room. For some it's rats. Now normally, someone just a little late like Ian, would end up at the regular door, but getting him there was the ninja's responsibility, and they were somehow incapacitated. So he'd strayed into the wrong door, only since he knew he should be here, he didn't dream up something to make him go away, he dreamed up something to bring him in. And where he was now, no one else could get into or out of. But I could talk him through it from the maze room, and I'd done it a couple of times before. I got there, and said into the microphone, "Ian?" "Who said that?" said the voice, terrified. Poor kid. "It's okay, it's me, Greg, you met me at the mall remember?" A beat. "Yeah, hi." "Hi. Listen kid, what do you see? Tell me exactly." "Nothing." "Nothing? Like an empty room?" I asked. "No, Nothing like nothing." "Like black?" "Like black," he said, "Only without the black. It's nothing. I've never really seen nothing before, and it's scary." Well it sounded scary. This kid had a heck of an imagination. "Listen up, Ian. Whatever you're seeing, it's in your head. For some reason, the minute you walked through that door, the room became this. What were you thinking about?" "About this meeting," he stopped, he was thinking, "About what was gonna happen to me if I was late. And then there was a voice on the other side of the door, but there was nobody there, just a long hallway. I started to worry if there was anything out here at all, or if it had all somehow disappeared cause I was late, and then I was here, in all this nothing." "Is the hallway still there?" "No, it disappeared." Well, I was stumped. Most of the things folks dreamed up were hard to get out of, but it just took creative thinking. This kid was giving me, well, nothing. It was just then that I noticed Ellen standing in the doorway.

      I had been waiting for ten minutes, trying to convince myself to leave, when someone finally showed up. Two someones, in fact. One was a woman was dressed completely in black, so I guessed she was with the guys that had talked to me. She smelled vaguely of smoke. She looked like she was in a hurry. She paused for a moment in the doorway to collect herself before entering. As she drew in a breath, it was like her face disappeared and was replaced by a mask. Very spooky. "I'm sorry I'm late," she told me, "I had to deal with technical difficulties concerning our mission." As she spoke, the man standing next to her started shaking. Suddenly I recognized him. It took me a moment since he wasn't wearing black. "Are you one of the black suit guys?" I asked him. He stopped laughing, his face suddenly smooth like the woman's. Again, very spooky. But cool too. "Um, yes," he said hesitantly, "yes, I am." I wanted to ask more questions, but before I could, another person arrived. The moment I saw her, I knew I would hate her. She was the exact opposite of me. First, of all, she commanded attention the second she walked into the room. How could someone with right red hair down to their butt not attract attention? Plus, she was gorgeous. Like, supermodel gorgeous. I bet her life is perfect. I bet she doesn't spend Friday night sitting at home and watching Stargate on Sci-Fi. Oh no. She probably had a different date for every day of the week. Her Fridays were probably spent with Dave, the hunky football captain, seeing a movie. A horror movie, so that he could put her arm around her when the plot started to darken... I was shaken out of my teen dreamworld by a hand being shoved into mine. I looked up and saw that it belonged to the red-headed girl. "Hi!" she said, in an entirely too upbeat voice, "My name is Scarlett! What's yours?" I just stared at her thinking, 'Don't you have better things to do? You have the whole world in the palm of your hand, why do you have to come and shove it in my face?' The woman in the black suit came to my rescue. "This is Gillian Tailor. She will be joining us on the mission." When the woman mentioned the mission, Scarlett was suddenly very alert. "So," she said, turning on the woman and using a voice she probably stole from CSI, "What's this mission all about anyways? Why wouldn't you tell us before?" The woman in black looked very uncomfortable behind her mask. "W-well... You see..." She tried again, "You will be told when you need to know." "What if I need to know now?" Scarlett asked. "The you wait." the woman told her. "Listen," Scarlett told her, I think tha-"  Slam.  We all looked around to see where the noise had come from. "Oh shit," said the woman, dropping her mask, "Ian came in the wrong door."

      After I left the mall, things had started looking up. All the way home I'd been worried sick about what to tell my parents, so you can imagine my relief when I found the agents had dealt with it. It was a little weird they'd told them more than me, though. FBI? CIA? To tell the truth, I was a little disappointed. I'd been expecting.... I don't know what I'd been expecting. The  Matrix , or maybe  Men in Black . Instead, it was turning out closer to  Alias  - you know, still cool, but not the same kind of cool. Oh well. At least I didn't have to go behind their backs. No one was certain on whether or not we were allowed to tell my brother, so it was just as well he was in Belgium. That's starting off on a tangent though; I won't go there. Anyway, by the time I got there, there was nowhere to park, so I drove around for about ten minutes and ended up having to walk about as far. So, twenty minutes late, I finally found the alley, and ran down it, and found the door. "You're late, Mr. Wallace" said a voice as I tugged on the door. It wouldn't open. Great, I thought to myself, I'm late, and now they're not gonna let me in. "I know", I said, not in a great mood, "I couldn't find a place to park. Let me in," "You have a car?" inquired the voice. It's tone was steady, and somewhat androgynous. It made me feel very uneasy. "Not technically," I answered, "I borrowed it from my brother. He's in Belguim studying -" "How unfortunate" the voice said, cutting me off. Then it changed the subject, "You certainly seem to have packed light," Shoot, I thought. " I left my bag in the car," I said. "Look, it's like a ten miute walk, I'm already late-" "Very well," said the voice. The door swung open, revealing a long hallway. The strange thing was, there was no one on the other side of the door.

      Where did they get this Gillian? Certainly was full of herself, thinking she could take out a bunch of ninja's with a swift kick in the balls. These guy's were experienced. They've had deadlier things aimed at their genitals than discount shoes; they knew to wear protection. Still, couldn't let her fall before she even gets the details of her mission. Several feet of string put to good use took care of the ninjas and kept me out of sight. Gillian's feeling all the better for herself, and I Can relax in my hiding place until whatsisname comes along with whatserface. Ah, Ian, here he comes now. Wait, Greg? Greg out of uniform? What is this? Then who is.... Ellen. I haven't seen Ellen since... What is she doing here? Both of my old... Have They   figured out my game? No, they're trying to catch me off guard. Well, I suppose they have, but I'll not fall for this. I just have to stay hidden longer than expected for this one. I suppose this will be different. Perhaps I've rewritten their rules. Hopefully they won't do the same to mine.

      I was not happy about Scarlett. And I was not happy with Greg for introducing Scarlett into the equation. But, for better or for worse-- for, as the agency would say "an indeterminate amount of time"-- Scarlett was going to be in my life. I was not particularly happy with my life at that moment, either. It's not all that often that we recruit someone as young as Ian Wallace or this Scarlett, but when we do, the parents have to be dealt with. Because I'm good with people-- charismatic enough that I usually get my way-- I am frequently chosen for this particular task. I hate it. I hate dealing with the parents. I hate lying to them. I hate lying to my parents, too. Or rather, lying to my dad, since I haven't seen my mom since I was thirteen. But it's a part of the job, and I love the job. All but that one part. Dad thinks I sell scarves internationally. Anyway, it took me about two hours to come up with a story to tell Scarlett's folks and steal the proper documentation from headquarters so that I wouldn't get chewed out. An exciting travel-study opportunity. Her friend Ian was going, too. Yay. I'll be honest, I do have a hard time keeping a straight face during the lying. I always have to practice beforehand on the serious-recruiter voice and the serious-recruiter face. The whole situation strikes me as funny because it's so very  Men In Black , or something of the sort. If any of those parents ever saw me out of serious-recruiter mode, they probably wouldn't even recognize me. So I want to laugh, but afterwards I always feel bad. After getting Scarlett's parents to sign on, which wasn't all that easy might I add, I had to make Mustang Sally speed to get to the play I had tickets for on time. I toyed with the idea of telling Greg I'd missed it and making him pay, anyway. Instead I decided to simply let him sit on the edge of his seat all night waiting for word on Scarlett. When I left the play there were already five messages on my cell phone. It was fun. The last thing I did that night before going to bed was check out my list of recruits, and that was when I noticed the last-minute addition. The next evening I was still so distracted by wondering what the agency had in mind with this that I was several blocks away from home before I realized I'd forgotten to unplug my hair straightener. Greg and I arrived at the end of Dunhill Street at the same time. At first I almost didn't recognize him. He wasn't dressed like a recruiter. He was dressed like a...  guy . A  normal  guy. It was slightly disconcerting. I guess I must have been staring, because he looked at me like a normal guy who's just realized you're staring at him. "Ellen." "Greg." Now he looked at me like a normal guy who is irritated because you're smiling in a slightly amused way and he's embarrassed. "I've been recruited," he said in an emotionless voice. "Again." "I  saw . And I just laughed and laughed and laughed." He was not entertained by my teasing. "Did you have anything to do with this?" "What? Why would I want you recruited?" "I don't know! To get even with me for the Scarlett thing. Or because you thought it'd be funny. Or something." "No, Greg, I swear, I had nothing to do with it. I'm not that high up. I'm just as surprised as you are, believe me." I paused. "Although it  is  kind of funny." We started to walk down the street to the alley. "Hey. Aren't you leading this mission?" he asked. "Yes," I replied. "First time. First mission since being recruited. And then being made a recruiter." I thought he might want to talk about our first mission, and how long ago it seemed, and how it was his second mission too, and the irony of me being promoted and him being recruited again. But he was going a different direction. "And aren't the leaders supposed to arrive at the rendezvous early?" "Ye-es..." "So how come you're just getting here?" "I was... I encountered... technical difficulties. Concerning the mission." "And the real reason is...?" "My bathroom was on fire." "Again?" "Gee, Greg, I just hope Fluffy isn't too lonely while you're gone." He stopped and turned to me. "How do you know about..." "Data, Greg. We know everything," I answered in my very best recruiter voice. I could see him turning red. It was then that we reached the alley leading to 1437 Dunhill, and stopped. It was quiet. Too quiet. This probably had something to do with the ninjas being unconscious on the ground. "Oh, crap," I muttered. "Gillian's already here."

      lol...The Little (Spanish) Pimps.  Nice. Anyways...Marten, you're not the only one stressed.  I think we all are...and everyone in the play is totally needing to be avoided.  So, I understand.  lol, I know my personal reason for being so moody...but ya'll prolly don't care nor want to know.  Yep.  I hope you get un-stressed soon...I miss the old Marten who didn't yell at me for painting the wrong way in stage tech.  :-( SQ(u)EE!

I need to do speech. the play is affecting me more than I thought it would.  indirectly, of course.  stress pipes. yarg, you interpret. thinky sleep good, burritos.

      Found a useful website today.  Comparative information on public schools of Indianapolis can be found  urlLink here .  All the vital stats, as they say.  I find it really funny that LN has exactly one Native American student.  I think I know her. You know what annoys me?  Ugly people who like to shout across the computer lab about their social lives to equally ugly people.  Hicks is a good, stereotypical word for them, or maybe white trash.  They like to verbally abuse each other. Marten: Bob Barker?  The "Price is Right" guy?  You are so out of it. Thomas: Point taken. SQEE!

Laugh with me its funny. So was BOO!, a bunch of "scary" shorts that LC players perform.      anywhy, I could've sworn either Nathan or Jonah said something about Lara. Maybe it was just Thomas.  Michael said her posts weren't funny. We must all obey the Great Michael!.    Sophia: there wasn't a real poll. um. don't hit me.  or anything.  Jonah:  I want a spork of doom.  Thomas: I can't go another day without central heating.  Nathan: I hope that works.  Lara wont make a very good minion.    Lara:  You can still post, can't you? I knew I forgot something!  Erin: HEY! ERIN! um... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIME TO POST RIGHT NOW(oops), SO I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER TELLING YOU TO DO SO!(ewok, be happy)  You know, I could take Lara off just cuz this is a lot of people to have on a blog.

      The results are in for state. I have the scores but not allowed to post 'em. Sorry Jonah. LC got fourth, which is disappointing compared to last year's second place, but I am still happy with a great performance. We got 6th in music and that is what dragged us down. We got 3rd in visual, and 3rd in general effect. Indy regionals and Grand Nationals will be very exciting.  Nathan: I shared your soul with Jonah and it gave me a soar throat :( Jonah: PiE! Huzzah for marching band despite the Protests of Marten and Soph Sophia: When are we gonna get a duo?! By the way, I do not post often because my posts would be pointless if I did.

      Rest in Peace, Robert Barker.  If all dogs go to heaven, you're gonna have a hard time when they found out who told their owners to spay and nueter them.  Just kidding.  You were a good man, and we hate to lose you.  The price was wrong. I know I've had a lot of Oklahoma titles recently, but it's what I know really well. Marten, go to View, Text size, Medium.  That should solve your problem.  It was a genetics project.  Soph, I likle that name better than Mindless robots and some of the others.  Lara, I'll support you, but only if you agree to be my minion.  Thomas, post more often.  Jonah, you're allergic to souls, remember?  SQEE!

      Marten, was this one of those "Hey, Thomas do you think?" polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either.  As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version.  We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot.  In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music.  We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that could be attributed to our band being very small compared to the others.  This made us too quiet for the dome and ruined the pianissimos at the beginning and end of the show, which contributed to the low effect score.  So really, the score isn't so bad considering what we had against us. We still should have beat Carmel.  But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk.  In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat.  Yay! And Now, Mtto5:  Marten:  Nope, didn't get smaller for me.  Also, don't tell Lara but I'm with you.  Thomas:  Now you write the LC version!  Larry:  Nice Poem. Also, don't tell Marten, but I'm with you. Also also, your new title scheme is Famous Chiropractors.  Have Fun.  Sophia:  I like your poems, too.  I like the second one better.  The first one has a few lines that don't sound poetic enough.  Nathan:  I will eat your soul with my spork of doom.  SQEE!

      Ok, I've calmed down.  I get fits of rage sometimes; I'm better now.  Plus it was pointed out to me that it's a 68 out of 80, which is actually closer to an 83%.  I'd just seen the 68 and assumed it was a percentage.   I know that's not the actual name of the song, but it makes more sense and I'm lazy.   SQUEE!

      Lisa, since I know you read this, my e-mail has been down since the move (a little over a month).  I can finally recieve messages now, but I can't send them.  Secondly, well, I'll get to that when I can reply to you.  I didn't want you to think I was being petty. Sorry, everyone else.  It's always a little stressful to get a months worth of E-mails all at once, and Lisa's were only slightly less annoying than Amazon.com's: Problem with your billing information.  Your order will be canceled in... 10...9...8...7...6.  Lucky I got to it now.  It still delays my order by 6 frickin' days. Other general complaints: My title scheme is to frickin' hard, Levi hogs the computer too much, and the flickering light above my head is really starting to get annoying.  Oh, and Ms. Knapp can take her 68% and stuff it. (I don't know what she can stuff, it just seemed like the right thing to say.) Errrr..... SQUEE!

      I was at my friend's house and she has this book from the library called the Encyclopedia of Serial Killers. It had all these serial killers and what they did listed and all sorts of creepy sadistic things. Its also had some "symptoms" for phsycopathic/serial killery...ness. There was bedwetting until adolesence as one and animal torture and obsession with fire too.. I like fire (-^^-) lol  Eeww, Marten, that game is gross. Even if it isn't really that graphic its just... =p. And its 6:15 when you come in! 6:15!

And your poem...(trying to think of perfect word here)...wow.  That's all I can think of to say right now.  You know?    Anyways...I don't actually know if it's based purely on the writing or on performance...I'd guess that it's based on the writing since there are other performing categories...but I really don't know!

      I'm not much for free verse poetry.  I think it's more of an expression for yourself than for others.  For me it is anyway, its how I vent. Not surprisingly, the only real poems I've written in the last two years or so, class assignments excluded, have been about Laura.  There's one in my other blog.  My problem is, whenever I write a poem I actually like, it's to personal for me to share with anyone.  I find I can't write poetry about something unless I really, deeply, care about it, in which case I can't share it. Getting back to the point, I really can't judge because I just can't get into that form of poetry.  I don't know enough about what makes it 'good' -- seems pretty arbitrary to me.  My question is, do you perform it, or are you being judged purely on the writing? Lara - don't you think Tiny Explosions fits Sophia's title scheme better? Marten - It's Larry.  Rachael's doing speech, and he's offered to help out like our dad is. Secret soul, by the way, is a super cool duet from "Jane Eyre the Musical" SQUEE!

      Alrighty then. My title scheme is just things that have absolutly nothing to do with my post unless of course you dissect it and it might have something to do with it.  About poetry, you have come to the right person. Marten, poetry doesn't have to rhyme, but its still fun to find words that do. Your poems are great already. Believe me I've been published. I personally think that the first draft is usually the best. It shows what your thinking at the exact moment of writing and that is usually the deepest point of that partiular emotion. Here's one of mine that I just wrote Thursday. I was listening to SOAD and I was so tired I didn't  even want to get up and turn off my cd player or my the light. I barely reached for my notebook to write it down:  "Waking Up Is Hard To Do"  5:00 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the large button on top It stops  5:05 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the button Radio still plays I pound harder Radio still plays I retreat back under my comforter Radio talks about  Sex Gays Enhancements Trends Money, money, money Sell, sell, sell Buy, buy, buy I shrink further beneath the comforter I hide I fear to face the cold angry winds outside my bedroom The radio is just a taste of what hides outside my safe haven My heaven  My lounge  My healing  5:20 I mash the button again Radio stops I roll over to doze in my newfound silence Silence.. When all are at peace  5:25 Radio plays automatically I try to shut it out Try to think I try to be at peace No success I wish to die I reconsider my wish I give into the Radio Set me free   SQEE!

      Hey guys, my diary won't let me post...so you'll get to give me feedback instead!  lol I wrote two poems (so far) for Project XL and I'd like to know what you think.  I don't think they're the best I've written ever...so...please...be nice.  "Change Over Time"  My 7th Grade Teacher's Favorite phrase used to seem Absurd, abstract.  But now I see, That behind the times, there really has been Change Over Time.  Once the world was dead, dark, desolate, but by dawn there came lights.  Light from the sun, Light from man's brilliance. But these lights Couldn't be relied upon.  So we're ever-searching, ever-wondering: What prompted this Change Over Time?  ~*~ (Insert Title Hereâ¦possibly âA Momentâ)  The sun rises over a dying cornfield.  Crows take flight awakened by the sudden, blinding light.  Their world has changed in an instant.  One moment forever altering their future.   So, as I said, not the best Iâve ever written.  I think my time when poetry was easy for me is over.  Now I have to work for it.  So this is just the first draft.  Yep.  So please tell me! SQEE!

      I'm really excited about State tomorrow.  The odd thing about that is, I'm not in marching band.  I'm excited like a normal person would be about the World Series or the Super Bowl, or like I would be about the season Premier of Stargate.  I want to see how it turns out.  Anything can happen. I've been forced into doing USX at Connersville.  That gives me about a week to learn how to Extemp. and put together a file with absolutely know help.  To make matters worse, no one knows where last years is (not that it would do us all that much good anyway).  Amar(at least two of you knows him, so I figure he's ok) has quite unexpectedly offered to give me a hand, and I'm grateful, if a bit confused.  His sister donated a bunch of stuff too, but shes actually nice sometimes so it was less surprising.  I still don't have enough.   Marten, guess who's gonna be judging and helping us out at speech meets?  Hint: it's an LN parent you know very well..... SQEE!

      The procrastinator is from thief of time.  It may be paraphrased though, I haven't read it in a while.   Sorry about disappearing regularly at Thomas'.  I was just a bit restless and bored. Had to move around.  Lara: Your title scheme cannot be invisible.  If it was invisible, we would not be able to see your titles.  I will kick you if you do not lower stealth fields.  And technicly, the only way someone passes any class like its nothing is by getting a D.  That proves that it's nothing (important) and its passing. You get no points.

      You know Alex?! OMG he is soo hott! He was in Jazz Band, Honors Chamber, and regular concert orchestra last year at FCV, so everyone knows who he is. Thats why making Jazz Band was so important to me, it makes me feel like I'm really, really good but now I feel like everyone is watching me to see if I'm as good as he is. Now I guess since I'm first chair now, with no practice, I might skip over to the eighth grade orch. if I DO practice...hmm...Or else I'll just be really, really, really good...Or maybe its because the other three are really, really bad...  Marten and Sofa:  You know what'll be really funny?! When I  have Mr. Hall and I pass his class like its nothing. lol but the way you guys are talking I probably wont...poopoo.. SQuEE!

      For those of you who don't know, I'm a section editor for the North Star, our newspaper.  I'm currently overbooked, working on two stories and a page.   Story 1: The Skinny on Wrestling.  Sarah, editor of our quarterly magazine MEOW, had the brilliant idea of taking the two least athletic people on staff, and making them participate in various sports for the magazine.  This eventually led to The Skinny.  In it's final incarnation, Colin Dugdale and I (the aforementioned least athletic people) attend a wrestling (this issue, anyway) practice and observe.  Afterward, we get together with the few of the guys, don the uniforms, and wrestle each other.  Pictures are taken and everyone laughs at us. (Fun gig, eh?)  We've watched the practice, we have to do the stuff and write the story Monday. Story 2: Regime makes (wins, loses, etc.) State.  The other girl in both North Star and Marching Band and I are splitting this story because we're the only two people on staff willing to attend the competition.  Because of the nature of it, we can't even do interviews until the end of Saturday, and we'll write the story on Monday. Page: I'm always responsible for designing the feature page, usually at least a two day proccess.  Because all the reporters with stories on the page got extensions, I haven't been able to start it.  Due: Monday.  So that's my Monday.  My Journalism class will be spent writing the Regime Story, SRT wrestling with Colin, and I'll stay after to design the page.  Or else I'll make the assistant features editor design the page by herself.  I hate having to give up the fun one, though.  The moral of this post:  Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday! And Now Mtto4  Nathan:  AD? All over again? Why not?  Marten:  Where does the procrastinator quote come from?  Lara:  Actually, we have an electric bass in our marching band this year.  Alex Shumard - he's in the pit.  Sophia:  So there is no Matthew Broderick-Nathan Lane version?

      Mr. Hall is an idiot...for those of you who don't know, he's our speech teacher, and he's the devil incarnate.  I hate him soooooooo (times infinity and one) much.  GRRR!!  My oratory isn't due until the last day, though...but I still need to work on it.  so ha.   Anyways...my friend (the one who burned me the CD and told me to rent the video) told me this morning that the Producers we rented last night was the only one.  I'm super sorry guys...I was looking for the songs.  SORRY!  lol and sorry for yelling so much...ya'll just wouldn't stop talking!  GOSH!  Anyways...working on burning the CD for you Thomas and Comstock.  lol I don't remember which one of you asked me for the CD...was it Nathan?  I think it was...I can't remember!

      I am so bored I'm posting for the third time today. ( -.- ')I have nothing to do. The lock in at church started 45 minutes ago so they're all having good times without me. Broomball... Corn Maze... Cosmic bowling... All the pizza and soda you could ever want... Its not really much of a lock in but I went last year and it was awesome.  The Dungeons and Dragons thing sounds pretty cool even though I have no idea how to play, but oh well, I'll learn. Since I'm so bored here's some li'l pictures:  =^.^= maow!   -^.^-)&gt;   (&gt;-^.^-  t(-^.^-t) finger givin' kirby man!!

      So, I was unpacking the other day, and I came across an old dusty box that I'd mindlessly packed into another box.  I opened it up and found a wealth of stuff from when Levi, Jonah, and I used to play Dungeons and Dragons together -- character sheets, maps, dice, and the old second addition books.  I realized that I really want to get back into it again -- and I'd like to invite you all to join me, Lara included.  I'm telling Tyler Rudd, Paul Simmons, and a few others you don't know about it, and I'm hoping to get together a diverse adventure group of 5 or 6 people.  I volunteer to be dungeon master, but if someone else wants the job, I'm open to different arrangements.  It's a lot of work though.  Don't say no till you've thought about it.  Old fashioned pen and paper RPGs, with the right group of people, can be really fun, and we're going to use 'simplified' rules, so learning the basics should take maybe an hour, hour and a half tops.  It's just an idea right now, but if enough people are interested, it'll end up actually happening. WIGII!

Maybe next week I'll just bring an air freshener for everyone. Marten, don't hit Pixy with your stick. He's cool. He might be a bit of an anarchy freak but he's still nice. Maybe I should just tell you that I go out with someone I hate so you'l beat them up for me...hmmm SQuEE!

      Lol, Marten might need to get his stick out of his closet.    Nathan :  Alright, I apologize, I'm sorry.  I was kinda being mean calling you a donkey and stuff (cuz that was the ass I was referring to).    Jonah :  Of course there are other guys!  lol, you didn't seriously think ya'll were the only guys I flirted with!  I can at least think of four others off the top of my head.  And about Claire...I am sorry, but I still think high school relationships are pretty stupid, so I knew ya'll were gonna break up.  It's just a fact of life right now.  But I'm very proud of you for breaking up amicably.  That's always wonderful.  So...support!  Larry :  Haha, my nickname's Sofa, so it's all good.  And, yes, it's only the FCV band room that smells like that.  I actually noticed that while I was there, too!  LC's band room isn't bad at all...you just have to ignore how many sweaty marching band members have practiced in there and it smells perfectly normal!  lol.  BTW:  You aren't considering joining marching band...are you?????  Marten :  You turd muffin!  You didn't say anything about my wonderful couch!!!  lol just kidding...but you still didn't say anything to me.  :-(.  hehe  So...that's it.  See ya'll tonight!!!!!  SO EXCITED!!! SQUEE!

       Nate: Sorry about the cursing, but the first attack was baseless and the second attack was below the belt.   Like my least favorite post of yours, Maria, If you didnt spend so much time on the people, and just got to the point, I wouldn't be complaining. Especially if you didn't even know the people, u didnt have to list them. You could just get to your point of the post.  Jonah:  Well, I didn't know whether or not I should be sorry, you said you broke up on good terms.  Sorry about ignoring your problems.  Lara:  um, wait for the band folks.  I like your bass, don't trade it. And while I could just kick people off left and right, I wouldn't be left with anyone to blog with.  I don't want to do this alone, it would turn into a diary kind of thing with a whole lot of rambling about stuff no one cares about, and i can do that in my head.            Maybe gossip was a bad word.  Rambling about people and events to which we can't relate would be better.  Like when Lara apologized about rambling about some guy who wants to be her boyfreind.  Of course, I should like to know more, in case I have to get my stick out of my closet...

      Above quote is from an interview with the author of I am the Cheese and its a great book and i just think that sounded cool and I want to read all of this other books. Tell me if they're good if you've read any. Sorry for all of the 'and's and stuff I'm kinda tired. I havent posted in a while because Marten ish always on so this might be a little long and boring. Alrighty then, the whole Larry thing started because Thomas didn't want to be called Tommy and he said that if i called him Tommy then he would call me Larry just to bug me but it doesn't bug me too much so I'm trying to get my other friends to call me Larry as well but they either forget or they just don't want to for some reason. =p So far only Pixy calls me that but i think its because he wants to be my boyfriend. wohoo im rambling!! Is it just FCV or do all band rooms smell like socks and old Saltine crackers? I seem to be the only person who gets a little screwed up in the head after jazz band but its probably because everyone else is used to it. I now regret not trading my bass guitar in for the mushroom shaped one. It was really pretty and i could've traded my Westone for it but I didn't so now I want it but I have to wait until next year to trade. BTW whats wrong with gossip?!?! Some gosip can be good gossip! Most everything I say is gossip anyways...  (sry for all the 'I's I didn't capitalize in the haste of writing this post) SQuEE! what are we revolting against my brother for? he could take us all off the member list and we wouldnt be able to post anymore...

      Fighting makes me sad.  I wish my friends would be nice to each other.  It's also kinda sad that in all this turmoil my actual problems are being ignored.  But, then again, this is a blog not an AA meeting, and I get the feeling nobody liked Claire anyway.  I don't know what else to say.  It hurts to come looking for support and instead find your friends cursing at each other about stupid stuff.   And Now, Mtto4*   Marten:  sorry about Claire  I think ? btw, I don't appreciate cursing at all.  I respect your right to use it when you deem it necessary, but keep in mind that I'm opposed to it.  Sophia:  There are other guys!?!?   Thomas:  LC's always been nice to us, in a we're very proud of you but you won't beat us sort of way, so you can see why beating you would be nice.  Nathan:  Maybe you were being a jerk, but I enjoyed the biting sarcastic way you went about it *Mtto# only includes people who have posted since my last post.

      I still this you're being asses as much as I am.  But I don't want this to be what this blog thing is about, so I'm going to try and comply with what you're saying.  With the party tomorrow and everything, I don't want us to be on bad terms.  That doesn't mean I'm agreeing with you.  It just means I'll try and keep the 'gossip' as you call it down, and we'll end this whole argument.  Cause if this isn't fun, theres no point. A few other notes: The spell bowl people: I didn't know any of them either.  All I know about them is that they had their names on the list but didn't sign up.  I was complaining about lack of commitment in general.  I didn't post the dream here because it was all about people you guys don't know.  I'm serious there, I didn't think it would interest you.  Believe it or not, most of what I've said is stuff I've thought would interest you, I mean, if you told me about similar problems I would genuinely be interested, whether I knew the people or not.  That's why it made me so mad. Anyway, it's over now.  Back to our regularly scheduled sillyness. SQEE!

      Nathan, you really were being an ass there.  That was uncalled for.  And really stupid.  You know what Marten and I meant...and I thought your story about your loveseat was quite entertaining.  lol just kidding...but it reminds me of a little couch I had when I was younger...it was blue and you could pull off the seat and it was a toy box!!! it was the coolest thing ever!!!  I loved it!  My dad bought it for me...but the fact that my butt got too big for it, plus the fact that I didn't play with toys anymore caused me to sell it.  Memories.    Anyways, back to whatever.  I just want to read interesting stuff...not stuff about these girls you like who I don't even know.  You know?  I mean...I could write about all the guys I flirt with in a day...and you wouldn't know half of them.  So would you really want to read that?  I didn't think so.  So...there.  lol see you tomorrow!

      ::Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.:: Ok Nate, what the Fuck? Thats right, youve been enough of an ass to get me to curse on a fucking blog. What the hell are you talking about, this history im so fond of?  Thomas is the history buff, Im just a hereditary reinactor!  I never thought id get this bull shit from you of all people. ::Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself. Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others. Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants.::  Gossip isnt a form of self examination, its a form of examining others.  Besides, Im really only complaining about solve..problem..maria, And sound of music(a bloody list) the stuff in all that jazz would be funny in moderation, I thought the rating with decimals and everything was funny.  your making this a bigger deal than it is.

      :: prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip')::  Nate : Your making an ass of yourself. We all know your dad. but in your post, how do you solve a problem like maria, You just went on about things that had no relevance to anything. we dont know amanda, drew, jane, katherine, and some other people we dont know. Well, we might know katherine, but thats beside the point!  I don't mind you talking about speech meets, or spell bowl, or whatever, but when the whole thing is described in great detail, It gets rather boring, especially when you talk and complain about people who, to the perception of the majority of the blog, don't exist!  Why don't you post your dream here? If it was interesting....   Thomas: Its not censorship.  Its editing. No seriously though, I'm not deleting anything he writes, I'm just complaining about the boring stuff he writes about people unknown.  There is a difference. Some on, read some of those old posts, do you want more like that? The time one, that was interesting.  Sophia: thanks for the support  Jonah:  sorry about claire, I think.

      Sophia supporting Censorship... Didn't see that one coming. Anywho, Jonah ideally we have a one two finish, but we shall see how this shapes up. I hope we beat LN, because I hope that we will beat every band. To Jonah: Glad Claire coming won't be too awkward for you. You know what would be fun?

      Can't we all just get along? Well, I broke up with Claire today.  The break-up doesn't bother me too much; I saw it coming a long time ago, and I did, after all, break it off.  What gets me is her reaction.  I was putting it off because of my fear that she'd be angry or sad, but what she did was much worse.  She smiled, said ok, and was completely unbothered by it.  In fact she almost seemed relieved.  It doesn't do much for my ego, and it confirms my belief that the whole relationship was meaningless.  What a waste of a chunk of my life.  Well, at least people like Kiel can't say I've never had a girlfriend (or for that matter never been to State).  I hope we beat LC just so I can rub it in his face.  That would be rich.  No time for Mtto5 today, too close to last time.  Consider the first line of my post my message to everyone. To Thomas's I add: I was kinda kidding, but whatever. Btw, this doesn't mean Claire won't be there on Thursday.  We "broke up amicably."

      Just to keep this from degrading into a warzone, I'm going to agree not to mention any other people in my blog whatsoever.  Unfortunately, this limits my choice of topic somewhat.  I think I'll talk about one of my favorite inanimate objects: My useless couch. (Technically, it's actually a 'loveseat', but I hesitate to say that, lest my mention of love be interpreted as a complaint that I don't have a girlfriend and hence be percieved of as 'gossip')  It's made of leather and it has a massive gash in it.  I ripped it myself, several years ago, prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip') to want to throw it away, but I convinced him to let me put it in my room.  I have since not sat on it once.  This pointless, boring story is exactly what it sounds like, and is typical of how interesting something can be when it contains no people.  But, I wouldn't want you to think of it as 'gossip'. I'd be interested to see your choice of literature.  Pretty much every book I've read and every movie I've seen has contained people you don't know, so I think you'd consider it pretty boring.  Shakespeare?  Terry Pratchett?  Star Wars?  Bunch of 'gossip'.  Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.  I don't know anyone who lived back then, do you?  By your definition, wouldn't that make it 'gossip'? By the way, I'm gonna need you're guy's help with an Etymology project over fall break, anyone who can come.  We're going to film a scene from Beowulf (an old English bit of 'gossip' about a guy you don't know) and dub it over in old English.  I might decide to use a scene from an old movie though.  I'll keep you posted.  There are other interesting projects going on, many of which I think you'd want to hear about, but since they involve people you don't know, you'd just call them 'gossip'. SQEE!

      Marten started the Blog, but only officially.  It was my idea, and was actually started while I was over at his house.  I'm as much responsible for having started it as he is.  Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself.  Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others.  Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants.

      lol...kinda like the Shirelles *since that's how you SPELL it and everything* but also having a Marten-esque touch.  I like it.    In reference to the revolt against Marten -I'm with Marten on this one.  He's the one who invited us onto this blog, so it's still officially his.  He made it, so if he doesn't like what you're posting then you need to make another blog for those posts.  Talk about interesting stuff.  Like how hot I am.  :-) Anyways, I got all my money stolen today.  I think it happened before 3rd block.  I'm so sad, that was all the money I'd saved up...$49.  lol, that's not even two allowances...so I just need to wait 2 weeks and I'll have more money than that, but, you know, it's the idea.  Someone stole from me.  That's so sad.  Sorry...I'm traumatized. Anyways (again) Pre-show is fun.  Marten, when is the fall play?  lol...isn't it November 6, 7, and 8?  Cuz I want to invite people to see my StArRiNg RoLe...lol...not...but I don't know when to tell them to come!   Anyways (I need to stop saying that) SO EXCITED ABOUT THURSDAY!!!! SQUEE!

      You'll notice a change from the regular scheme today- my title, while still following the scheme- has nothing to do with the content.  This is because what little content there is doesn't start with D.   Oddly enough Nathan DOES sound like a prep. By contrast, you'll notice I haven't mentioned my girlfriend once on this blog.  Actually that's kinda worrysome. If she's uninvolved enough with my life that I can neglect to mention her for 3 entries, including the one with the first letter of her name as the main letter, I probably don't spend enough time with her.  I've been thinking about that a lot.  I realize that I don't really love her, so I should probably break up with her.  Then when I try to, I realize I really don't want to lose her, and I figure I must love her or atleast like her a lot.  Kind of a vicious cycle, but I'm gonna have to figure it out one way or another.   Anyway, we took the PSATs (pronounced: pissats) today.  How boring.  I had a scary Jolly Rancher experience and ate some cookies, and that's about it.  Oh yeah, and I'm writing about the Regime at State for North Star, and I also designed a killer feature page on Halloween.  I'm becoming quite the trendy designer, if I do say so myself. And Now, MTTO5  Thomas:   Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred.  It'd be funny.  Nathan:  Way to stand up for yourself! You can post whatever the shrell you want.  Marten:  Sorry I just used your word.  Sophia:   You know I'd be swooning if I didn't have a girlfriend.  Lara:   Welcome to the blog.    i33nbS

      I had a really crazy dream last night.  So I've recorded it in my  urlLink dream log . I suggest you read it though, it's very odd. Marten, I'm sorry you don't like my topics, but this is my blog as much as anyone else's.  I don't always like your topics either.  Deal with it. (And I mean that in the nicest way.)   On the plus side, according to my established behavioral patterns, I should be out of the swooning "I need a girlfriend" phase in a week or so, when I will brief enter into the "women are evil" phase and be back at good, old, apathetic me by mid-November.

          Actually, there is no problem named Maria.  The problems are Amanda, Anna, Zach, and Chris, the people who DIDN'T SHOW UP for spell bowl, causing us to have to FORFIET THREE WHOLE ROUNDS!     Err.......... The worst part is, when ar last person finished in Round 7, we were in the lead!  If we'd continued at our average score, we would've come in second.  As it is, we came in Ninth, out of twelve, which isn't bad for a group that forfeited a third of the competition.  It's just a little irksome.    Seriously, if other people are depending on you, the least you can do is tell someone you can't be there  in time to find a replacement.  It's sickening.  I'm never talking to Amanda again.  This, combined with Romeo and Juliet, is just too much.    Ok, what else.  We got room assignments today for Branson.  Kevin Wack, David Meyer, and Drew Klages.  At the least, none of them have any serious hygiene problem.  They're not bad people either.  It'll be fun.    Now, to swooning.  Both Jane and Katherine have sisters a year apart from us who are both more attractive and more interesting then them.  So why am I stuck in class with the bad ones?  Oh well.  At least I've got both Webbs.   SQEE!

      Marten-Awww, well, it's nice to know that at least SOMEONE is swooning over me.  YOUR HAIR IS GONE?!  YOU ACTUALLY CUT IT?!!!! EEEEEK!!!!!! Nathan-I totally recognized Timon's voice on the CD...I just didn't know that Nathan Lane was him!!!  I thought it was Billy Crystal...doesn't he sound like that?!  But, yeah, I recognized his voice and also Matthew Broderick's voice from when I saw The Music Man.  That's a good musical, as well. Jonah-Congrats on State!  And even though Marching Band IS a death cult, I'm still proud of you guys' beating Carmel.  That's quite a feat!  YAY! Nathan (again)- Sqee or whatever is a comic-thing...I've seen it once, so you're not that far behind.    And I have to agree with Lara, it's spelled with a "u".  SQUEE!

           Wow.  Lots to say.  First off, Sophia: you're safe.  On the off chance any of us try to swoon over Lara, I think Marten would get mad.  It's unlikely anyway.  At any rate, I'm going to do all my swooning at my other blog, since thats what its for.      Second, I've thought of two more broadway songs about time, so we can continue that discussion whenever you want to.         Third, Sophia -- did you know that two voice actors on The Lion King have been in The Producers?  Nathan Lane, who did the voice of Timon, played in the Movie, and Mathew Broderick, who played the adult Simba is in the revival.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.  On that note, did you know Zazu the annoying bird was played by Rowan Atkinson?  Mr. Bean?  I had no idea, myself.      Fourth, Why are my posts always so much longer than everyone elses?  You guys need to write more.        Fifth, It's Walky is an incredibly well, written, well drawn web-comic, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's nice to finally learn about Jasons past, and this plotline seems sure to provide action, romance, and maybe a little background info on the cheese.  Plus Joe and Dina's Battleship is gonna be really cool.  I hope they don't just forget about it.  It's also nice to see a webcomic deal seriously with the issue of religion.     Sixth, You're adding webcomics to my list of taboo topics now, aren't you?     Seventh, Dune! The Musical! is coming right along, and I will show those of you who haven't already seen them the two sample songs at the party.     Eighth, what the frell does SQEE mean?  Is it some in joke I'm not in on? Wish me luck at Spell Bowl tomorrow!  Bye, ya'll! SQEE!

              Sophia, we are swooning.(or at leats I am)  We're just very good at not letting that sort of thing interfere with other stuff.  As for Lara, your too young for socrates cafe, and Sophia will once again be the only girl on here if you don't explain your title. They have to have some kind of scheme.  Don't forget to capitalize the first letters of your sentences, thats important to. About the only grammar related thing we really pay attention to here.       I'd congradulate Jonah on state if I didn't despise the utter control of marching band, though at this point, drama is nearly as controlling. My hair is gone. Woe is me.    SQ(u)EE!

      Marten, that is SO not cool!  You let your sister on here?!  lol not that I don't like you, Lar, it's just...I liked being the only girl on here!!! lol because then I could feel like all these guys are swooning over me...even if they are a bunch of geeks.  lol, but, you know, nice, funny, good friend geeks.  I should probably stop talking now.  But, yeah!!! Let's rent The Producers!!!  That's such a smart idea!  I'm so glad I thought of it!!!  lol...where's that from?  The Lion King, maybe?  Timon and Pumba?  Something?   lol I don't know...anyways.  SQEE!

      So much to talk about.  First of all, I just realized that I am really, really sexy.  Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy.  I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants.  I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic.  Actually not really, I just wanted to give Sophia an idea of what her comments would seem like to other people.  Anyway, Socrates cafe is awesome, and Ms. Guthrie is so cool! If she weren't ten years older and already married, I would be in love with her.  I I thrive off discussion, and coffee makes me hyper and the combination made it so I couldn't get to sleep until 1:30 (and I tried to wrestle Thomas's dog, Taz, who is on a permanent coffee high).  Of course, it didn't help that Levi's friends were over watching Leeches! (the new worst movie ever) untill 1:00.  We threw him a surprise party; it was lots of fun.   Why not rent the Producers at the Moby Dick party? (Just thought I'd throw that out) In other news... WE"RE GOIN" TO STATE!!! WOOO!! WE BEAT CARMEL!!! YEAH!! It was really crazy after we found out, and everyone was hugging everyone else.  This girl comes up and hugs me, then she's like "Hi, I'm Ashley." We'd never even met before!  It was very funny.   And now, messages to the other four. Thomas:  Join the Blog!  Nathan: Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall. Sophia: As far as the hair thing goes, you're so hot I never noticed your hair.  Or your face.  Or lower body. (j/k) Marten: Shrell is not my word, dram is.  Shrell is all yours.  SQEE!

      OMG...it's so freaky that you want to see The Producers.  I totally just got that CD from my friend...he burned it for me and told me it was REALLY good.  lol and it is...it's superb.  It's hilarious!!!  SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER!!!  omg, you soooo need to see it.  Anyway...Alice Laramore LOVES Pippin...so that's obviously a pretty good one. Anyway anyway, you thought I was hotter with long hair?  Really?  You're not the first guy to say that, actually...I just don't see it.  I thought I was kinda too normal-looking back then.  Sorry...we can stop talking about me and my hotness.  I just realized a few hours ago that I was simply irrisistable (lol just kidding) and wanted to share it with the world!!!   SQEE!

      What happened to the interesting time topic? Not that i mind thinking of how hot Sophia is. Although, I wanna-screw-her hot is somewhat relative, depending on the guy.  But, yes, Sophia, you are so hot it literally burns.  Good thing i have quite a bit of self control.        Ha! I knew nate only went to socrates cafe for the girls!  but once again, i must complain about your topic.  who cares what musicals you want to see? I mean, if you chose one, and talked about it, sure.  But you just have a bloody list! What the shrell? I dont care if thats jonah's word   SQEE!

           There are so many musicals I want to see.  I've been browsing for information on "The Pajama Game" and I've come across a whole bunch of shows I'd never heard of that looked really good.  I'm gonna start getting them out of the library, though.  As soon as I have time.  The list so far: Rent (just missed it -- Ergh!) The Last Five Years (Just ordered the soundtrack from Amazon) How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying Jeckyll and Hyde Blood Brothers The Civil War A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum The Producers Miss Saigon Little Shop of Horrors (Heard the Soundtrack -- Loved it) Pippin        There are more, I just don't have time to list them right now         Sophia: You're very unobservant.  I personally thought you were hotter back when you had long hair (I know you hated yourself then, but that doesn't change it).  I think something in between would be best for you though.  About like mine (Styled differently, of course).  But you're still really hot.  You know who else is really hot?  Christen Neary.  Not gonna elaborate anymore on that here, though. One more thing: I'm now on the spell bowl team.  We're doomed. SQEE!

            That is kind of important. I've thought of time a lot. Not entirely like that, but it makes sense.  But any one can percieve time like that. how would it affect how they interacted with people who percieved time linearly?        I thought of time being percieved as longer or shorter in diferent circumstances.  Like in a car.  If you spend more than four hours in a moving vehicle, whenever you were got into the vehicle in the first place feels like yesterday.  And what about days that feel like other days? like when thursday feels like monday, and sunday feels like wednesday.and you know how time flies when your having fun?  It doesnt always do that, but it almost always slows down when your bored. SQEE!

               Since you say my comments are inane, I've decided to address an issue of the utmost importance.  Something that's really been bothering me lately.  Linear time makes no sense.            Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it.  And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously.  That would be mass chaos.  What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time.         Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next.  Friday will come after Thursday.  Two o'clock will come after one o'clock.  Causes will have immediate effects.  What if you had control over this.  Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class.  SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before.  If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT.  It's just your perception of events that would change.        You may complain this would cause paradoxes.  Well, it would.  But only if used irresponsibly.  If overused it would get quite confusing.  The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life.  But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress.       Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling?  If you do, that's great.  If not, it just goes to prove that everything I think about that's not inane is insanely complicated.       Bad puns excluded, of course.

      Yes jonah, I will add your link when im not lazy.  haha ur in marching band.  You are quitting next year, are you not?  I tried to convince Kiel, but now hes gonna try out for section leader, or cult leader.  poor soul.       Your next point is a valid one. I made it on the post that never was, because my comp screwed up and deleted it.  Hey, readers that I didnt send a link to, find someway to tell us ur reading it!  Kinda locks, most blogs have a little spot for comments or notes.    i think we should start an online socratic cafe even if no ones reading it. It will be fun.  Hurray philosophy.  nate, Ur topics are all gossipy, or about people.  Other than the fact that we dont know these people, It is kind of the lowest form of conversational intelligence         we love you too, Sophia.  See? evil people can change over time.  Don't diss ur own species so much. though thats a bit of an exageration, u werent evil, we were just ahead of our time.  While I do approve of what our country is supposed to stand for, I can agree that weve become decadent and desesitized as a society, and the fact that we blame the media doesn't help.  It only keeps us from doing anything about the real cause of the proble, and that is that kids are raising themselves.  but i skipped a bunch in that, and it prolly doesnt make too much sense. I agree with schuck kinda, Were gonna fall like Rome soon. Prolly by the end of this century, if not quicker  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional.

      Well, that was Thursday.   Oddly enough, it felt like a Friday.  That happens sometimes, but I must be careful not to think tomorrow a Saturday, lest I miss school.  Or, in this case, show up at 5:00.  Yes, I'll be at my school at 5:00 on Saturday because the esteemed Low Brass captians have decided that just because we need to be at school at 7:00, it's no reason not to come two hopurs early for a Low Brass Breakfast.  But it's oK, I can sleep on the bus.  Speaking of marching band, today was the last rehearsal before regionals, and I think we're gonna make state.  Unless somebody screws up. Which brings me to my next point.  Or rather, doesn't bring me to my next point because it has nothing to do with marching band.  And the point is: For whom are we writing this anyway?  For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?  I need to know how much background to provide in an entry.  Also, I think I'm going to shamelessly advertise my other blog,  urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog.  It's not a blog like this one, I have Compendium and  urlLink What Kind of Day Has it Been?  for that.  Tales is a story blog, in which I'm writing an amusing story about toasters at the moment.  However, other stories will follow.  And now, messages to the other four. Thomas: JOIN THE BLOG! Nathan: I thought you weren't supposed to use this blog for ranting about your love life. Sophia: I never thought of you as any of those things, but then again I didn't really notice that you didn't want to be associated with us, so I was probably just naive and/or in denial. Marten: If you can't remember it it can't have been too important.  Also, if you could add TftosotC (what an abbreviation!) to the links in the blog, that'd be cool.   All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.  I'll say.

         Whoah.  I'm exhausted.  Choir concert today.  I'm hesitant to say anything about it for fear of that sounding like the most important.  We did well.  I, on the other hand, made a complete ass of myself onstage.  But apparently Mrs. Dingman is the only one who noticed.  I don't know.     One good thing about being in the prestigious top three choirs is you get to watch the Hip Street girls change clothes.  Of course, their overall hotness level went down a notch when Danielle left, but it's still at, like, 9.6 out of 10. Which means Laura must be, like, a 22, as I realized I'd actually rather look at her fully clothed then watch them in their underwear.      Kudos to Millenium, they improved dramatically since Thursday.  They've still got a long way to go, though.  But so do we all.      Shiny red doesn't become me.  Just had to say that, cause it's so true.  I have a whole new respect for Lexi; she got my hair to stay back and up.  The combination of that and the suit, of course, made me look like a colombian drug lord, but that's life.  Lexi is also I have to say the most attractive African American girl I've ever met.  Not to say black girls aren't attractive, just that it's better than saying "Fourth hottest girl". (By the way, number 3 is actually Mexican, so don't tell me I'm being racist).  She's a senior, though, so just about as off-limits as Tiffany.  Oh well.    Thank you for your comments Soph, they made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but not fuzzy like when you eat mold.  In the words of Pete Abrahms, "And that's it.  I'm going back to bed."

Anyways...MOBY DICK PARTY!!!  Rent isn't on video...so we're gonna watch Moby Dick!  I'm so excited.  Yayness.  Anyways...hmmm...Marten and I had fun cleaning out paint buckets in stage tech, didn't we? Do you want to know what I think is highly ironic?  The fact that when I knew you guys before...I thought you were so stupid.  I thought you were incredibly dorky and I didn't want to be associated with you because that was how I was in 4th and 5th grade...but now, here I am, truly happy and having the best time with three of the coolest guys that I've known for the longest and never imagined being friends with.  That was quite a long sentence.  But anyway...I realize now that you guys were the awesome ones and I was the stupid, idiotic, moronic, immature (shall I continue?), butt-headed, (okay, blanking on more mean words I can use to describe my 4th/5th grade self) one.  So I just wanted to say...I think...that you guys are the awesome-est and I'm just so happy that I finally got to know you and realized how incredible you are. So, I'm done with my testimony.

      I can dance!  It takes me forever to learn, but I am now without a doubt not the worst dancer in the choir.  I practiced with various combinations of Laura, Chad, Amy, and Megan today for a total of about two hours, and as a whole, we no longer look like crap.  Millenium is a different story.  If they don't improve by next year, I'm going to shoot myself or join band.  Freshman aren't supposed to be perfect, but these guys are absurd.  There is on e guy with any facial expression whatsoever.  Problem is, he's the worst dancer of the lot.   And that's saying a lot.  Most of them are two or three beats behind, and their movements are either lazy and half-hearted or jerky and disconnected.  Or both.  Oh, and they're not singing either.  Basically, if this is the future of the Lawrence North choir program, we're screwed.  Oh, and by the way, I'm not putting the name of the show in the title anymore.  It's too cluttered.   I'll add it to the end of the post.  If anyone wants to know, this one's from Songs for a New World.  And I deleted the stupid signature line.  It's tacky and blatantly untrue.

I thought it was quite an inspiration.  lol cuz the initials would be DBW and you could say it like "Debuwah".  lol Like a retarded Deborah.  That's my mom's name!  Isn't that the uber-peachiest?

Laura, if by some bizarre chance you end up reading this, don't click that link, even if you already know everything that's in it.  I refrained from reading your online diary when I found it.

But now, it's just like...What was I thinking??   So anyway.  Enough about that.  I don't really know why I'm writing in here; there isn't really that much to write about.  Cept I've got a little crush on a friend and I can't like him because I don't want to screw up our friendship.  How much does that suck?  lol cuz I think it sucks mucho.  Anyways...au revoir!

      Well, My E-mail's finally up, so I can do this blog thing for real now.  First off, Muppet Movies now count as musicals. So do Disney Movies.  Because I said so.  Second off, Sophia is not my girlfriend either, and while I was thinking about remedying that about a week ago, I decided against it.   As my friend Glennie said, when you can't drive and you go to different schools, 20 minutes is a long distance relationship.  She is really hot though.  I don't have a girlfriend.  Never have.  Don't particularly want one either.  More on that in a later post.  My next post is gonna give you a little backgound on my romantic history.  It'll help you understand my attitude towards girls in general, and Laura in particular, as I suspect she'll come up again.  Plus it's a great read.  I'll probably post it on Wednsday.  Well, that's all for now.  Word to all my homies!  Peace!  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

      So.  Thursday.  Ha, and, no, I'm not Marten's girlfriend.  Poor Marten.  He wishes.  Ha.  Just kidding...Marten's super cool.  If any other super-cool, majorly hot girls read this ((Thomas, you listening?!))...Marten's definitely worth crushing over!!   Anyway, I went to a concert last night!!  And moshing has developed some muscles in my legs that I didn't know existed!  It's painful, yet exciting, because I just thought my legs were devoid of muscle.  Haha.  Anyway...great day today, and this band name's so super great! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

      Hey.  I'm Sophia.  Of course...my name-thing says my name's Nicole.  That's a safety thing.  Plus it's a "Don't-Even-Think-About-Spamming-Me" thing.  You get the drift.  Anyway, my titles are going to be totally rad band names...if they existed.  Haha.  Anyways, I'm Marten and Nathan's friend...their super-hot, way-cool friend who just happens to be a girl.  Ha.

        ah, jeez, now even my dad yells at the tv when the footblah team is doing badly.  I just dont see the point of some spectator sports.  Especially racing.  see the cars. see the cars go around in circles.  second to that is baseball. some times there are cool catches, slides, but reall, its just a guy hitting a ball and running a square. excuse me, diamond.      the weird thing is, my little sister enjoys watching me play video games.  I dont mind either, if the player is good, and the game a cool design and graphics, like Zone of the Enders.  this could be why one of my more favorible sports to eatch is tennis, for its similarity to pong.  That could be a new revenue, competitive professional video gaming. I hope so, because its a definate net if none of my other career possibilities fall through.

      Air of mystery? more like air of flatulence.  I mean, N! you sound like a James Bond fanatic. I mean, I liked Q, but its the wrong way to go for an air of mystery. You should've used some greek pseudonym like Demosthenes or something.  Ok, enough posting things like a conversation, this is going to get boring, and I don't want to spend the night in a battle of wits, not online anywhy.  How about a round or two of goldeneye on my old '64?                          ToLd you I i cold TYPE All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional.

      Thanks a lot.  Now you've ruined my whole air of mystery.  You know chicks dig an air of mystery.  Now I need a new schtick (it's yiddish, and not at all what it sounds like).  Oh well, I'll think of something.  Oh my gosh I just thought of something.  What if some weird creep finds this and steals my identity?  All kinds of people are on the internet.  Anyway, if that happens, I'm taking yours.  Your identity, I mean.  It's only fair, since you caused me to lose mine.  I'll be Marten Dollinger, and you can be some weird internet creep.  That'll teach you to reveal my secrets online.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

      I'm actually not Marten.  I'm the other guy who write's for this blog, but my e-mail's down so I'm using his name for a while.  You'll know it's me because I name my posts after songs from musicals (with the musical in parenthesis).  Oh, and also, unlike him, I can type.  You will know me simply as N.  That's the actual first letter of my actual name, and I'm not telling you any more of it.  Be happy you got that.  More on Wednsday hopefully.

      Nurr, Michael.  I can say "lol" as much as I'd like.  You want me to prove it?  Because I will!  I bought a new CD!  It's VEGGIETALES!  Silly Songs With Larry!  OMG, I love it so much!  And there's a remix...that's absolutely FANTASTIC.  It's so great.  Sorry, I'm just so excited about my new children's CD.    It's okay! I had Subway!

      I know that I post too much, but I still had stuff to say and didn't want to add to my previous post that was almost Tolstoy-Length.  1.) I italicize  Claire  because I happen to think that  Claire  is a hussy who isn't good enough for Jonah. I have no problem with Ashley though. She seems nice. Unlike  Claire .  2.) I hate it when people say LOL. It just really annoys me. I think Sophia has said it in the past, and I'm not trying to tell her how to post but I think it is one of those phrases that can only be said by girls or gay men. Not that there's anything wrong with that... However this poses a quandary, cause Sophia's a girl Not that there's anything wrong with that...  3.) I think that Sufferage killed Chivalry. I also think that if you have the right to vote, serve in the army, and have equal rights, you can open your own damn door. Unless the guy arrives at the door first. If the girl arrives first it's not my problem.  4.) I have created forums.  At this point, we really don't need them since no-one but us reads the blog. But I believe that discussion is good and that forums are better.  So tell everyone you know. Tell your friends. Tell everyone who has an IQ over room temperature. And Send them to our site. Write it down for them. It doesn't matter, just get them here. And then get them  urlLink here   Have problems? Objections? Rude remarks? See your friendly comments page for details on getting those to me.

      Let's start off with this. Shut up Nathan. Caffeine's the only way to fly. It's my anti-real drug. And Tommy Schlamme was executive producer of The West Wing and Sports Night. And that is officially calling anyone named Thomas who I think I could beat up. A Thomas larger than me will remain Thomas.  I have to admit that the mini JournalCon thing was fun. Jonah "Fun Stuff" Comstock and Marten "Grizzly Bear" Dollenger came over. I was constantly distracted by Marten's disturbing mustache and medium long hair. I think I may either be the first to rise up and say it or absolutely wrong, but Marten really looks bad with long hair. Or maybe he just looks bad all the time. In my opinion, if you're going to look bad, then you might as well look bad with a low maintenance haircut. He asked on one occasion sometime between the time where Marten attacked me and the time(s) Jonah was being vaguely gay "Why am I so Goddamn Poor?" My response? "Too much money on haircare products." I often had an urge to beat him over the head with a frozen butter braid and drag his limp unconcious body to Great Clips. If you are opposed to this, don't make post about it. Just use the comment buttons that I created. For the Glark to Marten's Sars. Another allusion you don't understand, courtesy of Michael Christie.  Right now I'm listening to the credits music from Pirates of the Caribbean, the best [live action] movie of the summer. Disney actually threw in the live action comment in its DVD commercials. To distinguish it from their other best movie of the summer (and the most popular DVD of all time) Finding Nemo. Both of the movies were movies that the more I think about them, the more I like them.  Erin - You watch Joan of Arcadia? That's so cool! I love that show! Were you here when I used "Anticlimatic means you're against the weather" in a convorsation.  And speaking of which I have another one coming soon. I bandied around the idea of making Erin my mindless love-bot, but realized she would blow an artery if I actually did. Hopefully she will just find this hilarious and not hunt me down and kill me dead. As actors are wont to do.   By the way, I have made up my mind that my improv skills will vastly improve if I add various phrases to my preparation. To date I have added the following "They got eaten by monkeys" and "Get Out. Now."  That's all for now. If you had half as much fun reading this post than I had writing it, well I've had twice as much fun writing it than you have reading it. I'm Casey McCall, and you're watching Sports Night

      The Star Trek date went amazingly well.  I got both Nana Visitor and Jason Carter - who I had no idea was going to be there- to sing to us.  I also got an autograph and a death threat from Jason (Luckily for me, he didn't have a Minbari fighting pike with him at the time).  I did not buy her a tribble, although she did buy a tribble for her mom.  Ashley told me she likes me better than her birds, then Richard Biggs (B5's Dr. Franklin) asked me if she was my Lady.  Anyway, with all that, we're together now.  You can meet her at the speech meet on the tenth, or I  might  bring her to youth group sometime. Micheal: That only makes it funny when you're on Caffiene, which most of us aren't at the moment.  Also, what the heck does Schlammes mean? Jonah: I have a statue of Emperor Palpatine.  Would you like to borrow it?  Oh, and cornblog is a stupid idea. Lara: Where can I get a copy of your book?  And will you sign it?

      lol, ehh...it's 1:15 right now...so I don't think I'm gonna come.  I might plan on coming to the JournalCon, though.  That does sound a bit interesting.  hehe.  anyways...I'm going to go get beautified cuz my mom's paying.  lol, I sound like such a barfy girl.  Okay, I'm just going to stop.

      That, I have just discovered, is the tagline of Joan of Arcadia. In speaking of which, Michael, did you see the previews for next week's episode at the end last night? My commentary was... But she's OLD! ("She" being Mary Steenburgen.)  I'm glad there are no sweeps in real life. I wouldn't be able to stand November, February, and May. Jonah: Tear down a statue of Emperor Palpatine. That will always work. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

      Sofa - If with only one hour to go you can provide snacks and figure out where I live, than yes you can come. I really didn't anticipate this turning into a JournalCon though, people  Jonah - Tommy! S c hlamme's! Mommy! is brilliant. As is Ma Hornsbeck.  The first is funny 'cause of internal rhyme the latter because I was on massive amounts of caffeine when I wrote it  I don't like it. I don't like it at all.  Me Either. This Signatures Sucks!

      The title refers to the Blitzblog, and the confusion it surely raises among readers.  It's also a fun bit of alliteration.  So, first thing - the beginning of the conversation involved Michael commenting that I smelled weird, which is what 'point taken' was in reply to, as well as all of the shower stuff.   Second, all formatting was lost in the posting, but when Michael says 'with Claire?' (7:40:49) it should read 'with  Claire? ' folowing the unwritten rule that Michael cannot mention Claire's name without italics. Third- The correct terms for referring to people's mothers: Mine and Nathan's- Carol, Jonah's Mommy, or Ms. Hornbeck (Not Ma Comstock or any variant) Thomas's- Mrs. Fowler, Momas, or Mhomas (Not Tommy! Shlamme's! Mommy!) Michael's- Mrs. Christie, possibly Bonnie Fourth- There is no fourth item.  Anyway, news from the other side of the corndog.  I know how to use the template well enough to not only add links, but add a totally seperate item to the sidebar - Stories.  This will be lots of fun when there's actually more than one. But Marten- this is proof that you should give me mod power so I can make cool, trendy stuff for our sidebar, or just add my blog to the links.  Also, Who thinks I should change the name to 'Tales from the other side of the cornblog?'  And Now, a long awaited Mtto8:  Nathan:  *snicker*  Michael:  Loved the West Wing comparisons. Btw, did you notice how I've been spelling your name correctly?  Erin:  Yay! The war is over.   I feel like we should be tearing down a statue of someone.  Lara:  Welcome back, how's the book selling?  Thomas:  Actually, Spinachs do have livers.  Atleast, they cloned one that does in a secret lab in Montana.  Sophia:  Michael's already mad enough at me for inviting two additional people, so it's his call.  I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Well maybe a little.  But it smells wierd.

      Ah, Lara's back.  I liked the book tour thing.  If you post again it has to have little static sound effects in it. that can be your compensation for not having a title scheme.  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin - I insist on getting you a gift certificate, at least. I have Christmas/JournalCon gifts for everybody in mind already and will work on getting them purchased.  Lara - I'm sorry, I have to ask. What time is it in Johannesburg? 'Cause you must not know that Erin and I have buried the metaphorical hatchet.   Jonah - I'm Casey McCall and this is Dan Rydell and you're watching Sports Night on CSC so stick around.  Nathan - Aww... Nerds in love. Maybe you could propose to her. You would give her 'the one ring' as your wedding ring, then you would buy a spaceship and adopt blobby aliens of some kind and then get some pet tribbles.*  Marten - Sorry your thanksgiving sucked. Mine didn't. Read about it here at What Kind of Day Has It Been. Or not. Depending on whether I'm sitting in the office updating or watching a rerun of the pilot of Joan of Arcadia. Probably the latter.  Thomas - I think he died. Just my opinion. I heard his name at LC mentioned. They wanted him to come down to the dean's office for messages. Maybe his mom picked him up and they moved to Sri Lanka.  Sophia - Refrigerator Box? Cool.  Also regarding the webcomic comparison. I really don't know what you're talking about, so I'll put it in terms that I understand  Marten's omnipotence and wisdom qualify him as Jed Bartlet. Erin is the tall attractive press secretary CJ Cregg. I am the lovable, but still annoying Deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman. Jonah is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director, whereas Nathan is Toby Ziegler, Communications Director. Oh and Sophia is Donna, who is Josh's assistant. Lara is Mandy, who was a major player in the beginning but was never heard from again. Thomas is the aging chief of staff Leo McGarry.  Cut me out of the loop, will ya...  *This was meant to be something said to provoke laughter, otherwise known as a joke. Just don't want Erin to think I be dissin' Nathan.*  *This was also a joke, where I made a blatant attempt to state the obvious. Please don't hurt me.

      Sorry I haven't posted in so long you guys, but you know how it is with an older brother hogging the computer day in and day out...maybe you don't then.    Welcome to the blog Michael and Erin! Stop fighting its buggering me.  I don't know why but I don't feel too talkative right about now.  What did I write anyways?  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      I just asked Ashley to a Star Trek convention.  I don't really know why, it just seemed like a good idea at the time.  I saw the article in the paper, realized it was the same time as we were going to lunch and then.. it just sort of fell into place.  In retrospect, it seems really crazy.  I mean, she watches Star Trek, but she's not as big a fan as me.  Still, she said yes.  I hope it works out; there's no going back now.   And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Thanks, Michael, but an end to hostilities is more than enough for me. I'm sorry for being so... well, bitchy. Okay, everybody, it's officially over. You can all come out of the bomb shelters now. (Group hug.) Marten: How can I stay mad at you for more than ten seconds? As Magrat Garlick herself would say: "Um." I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving! I know I did. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin, I sincerely apologize. I realized that on this day of thanksgiving that my remarks and behavior was inappropriate. I would like to bridge the gap between us by purchasing you two tickets to "One Man Star Wars" in Chicago. I can't provide lodging or transportion, but Expedia frequently has good deals. The show is playing at The Noble Fool theatre and is playing January 1st and 3rd. It is probably playing more in the future beyond that but Ticketmaster has no information. Provide dates, and if tickets are available they're yours.

      Nate, I think you would be the nerd who gets caught up in everything Sophia would be the insane beauty, Erin, would be, um, Queen Magrat.  I know thats irrelevent.  Erin: um, sorry, I figured once you had told him it would be alright, I thought it might help the situation in general if he knew exactly what the problem was.  Woohoo! Nates got a date! I claim it as a personal victory that had nothing to do with me.  See above exclamation! Jonah has updated the toaster story! Another personal victory. All points revert to me. I dont think Lara counts as a character in this little webcomic, as she no longer exists other than an odd gag about a book tour in a random location.  Its thanksgiving, and I am in the last place I want to be, but its good anyway cuz Matt's good at painting models. He's working on Tau right now, only nathan or jonah will know what I mean, but who cares?  Hey Thomas! Find something interesting and post about it! I want to see that catchy little title scheme again. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      One last thing to Michael: For one thing, you kept nagging about subject lines and the way people did their convorsations. As far as "widespread" goes, at the time Marten notified you of my "angry letter," Marten, Thomas, Sophia, and I think Nathan (I'm not sure about the others) were all getting fed up with it as well. They didn't put it in any form of print; the communication was strictly vocal. I'm tired now and I'm going to bed. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land. DONNA: Itâs gonna be an unbearable day. -The West Wing "Post Hoc, Propter Ergo Hoc."  Heh Heh Heh...forgot about the "Quivering mass of indecision".  Erin, Also just want to ask, where exactly did I tell you how to post on the blog. Just show me. And believe me, if I never exchange posts with you again, it won't be soon enough. And I'm "widespread desire for you to moderate your habits"? Erin, what are you talking about. Marten has no problem. Nor do Jonah, Nathan, Thomas (I don't think...), Sophia or Lara. So unless you have split personality I don't really see the "widespread desire".   Done People. The Erin Problem is solved. Unless this post gives her (and then Marten) an anyerism I'll see y'all next week.

      Ahem. Yes, Michael, I did read the whole thing. After being awed by your brilliant mockery of my typos (I don't know-- Are we in sixth grade?) and amazed by how full of yourself you really are, I have only a few things to say. I don't care what you say in your convorsations. I don't care what you want to make up about Rob Lowe and shoes. But it is neither your place nor your right to call me a "quivering mass of indecision" or to instruct me or anyone else as to correct posting on the blog. You don't seem to have taken to that treatment yourself. And I'm interested that you had to go to an outside source to find sufficient means of mocking me. While we're on that subject, Marten, I'm curious to know exactly why you chose to share a private email with someone else without my permission-- with, in fact, my having asked you not to. I'm sorry if it's getting mean, but you're the one who told me to start it.  On a closing note, I apologize for the inconvenience to fellow bloggers. But I have no intention of moving this elsewhere, as I have no intention of being involved in it nearly so long as such a commitment would imply. I, for one, have better things to do with my time than trade insults on a website set aside for that purpose. I have no problem with both of us remaining on the blog so long as you know of the widespread desire for you to moderate your habits. If we are agreed in that regard, then let's all just move on. That's about all I have to say about that. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Well, Marten, a pair of girls succeded where you failed:  they have successfully gotten me over Laura.  Heather was, of course, in on it.  Plus, then I found the perfect actually attainable girl and asked her out.  We have absolutely everything in common.  She's even a Babylon 5 fan!  What more could I want?  It actually makes the break seem like a bad thing, just cause it's a time during which we wont see each other when we normally would.     Her friends are always trying to get her a boyfriend, and now that she's found a guy who likes her without their help they won't leave us alone, so we're keeping it a secret at LN, just to spite them.  There's my love life update, hope it doesn't bore you to much. Michael: Why were you calling Erin non-jewish?  It seems like sort of a bizarre insult. Jonah: If this is a web-comic, I know Erin's the insane beauty(Oasis, Margaret, sort of Gwynn, Sal), Lara's the wishy-washy younger sister who only shows up occasionally (Min, Lilly, I know there are more), and Marten's the brilliant, but mysterious blonde (Riff, Fooker, Roger).  So who's the hapless Nerd who gets caught up in everything?  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      I really do not mean to post often, In fact "Enemies" has been my first post over one word in five days. I also move to take the Blog War into a seperate website. I've got an extra one, me and Erin will battle it out there and the winner shall return to Compendium victorious. And as anyone who has seen "Posse Comitatus" knows, Victorious in war shall be made Glorious in peace.   Jonah - I really wish you would post more frequently as you would know that Marten and I have resolved the posting issue, in a calm and resolved manner. Yes, I know. You're all shocked. Michael used diplomatic resources to resove an issue rather than just slitting the offending persons throat.  Erin - I wait for your reply. I hope you consider yourself a worthy opponant. I also hope you had the stomach to finish my post and did not just e-mail Marten in a "hissy-fit" of epic proportions. I also have to say, that quite frankly I don't give a damn if you are a senior. Just means you'll probably be gone next year anyway.  Gratias Tibi Ago Domine will be up Friday  Until next time, I'm Michael Christie, and your ring "The Enemy Within" on CoS. Stay tuned for comedy in the form of "Smack the Pony".

      Bug's have ears?  Begun this Blog War has.  Insert Fanfare.  Is there anything else? If there is, It should be entertaining instead of just mean.   Jonah's right about the whole webcomic thing.  Michael's our own Bun-Bun, only no switch blade.   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      You're both right. Michael, yes, you've singled out arrogance and meanness (but in a good natured way) as your niche on the blog.  And, as every good webcomic teaches us, every group of good guys needs an ambiguously evil character.  So, we put up with you and don't take offense.  In fact we enjoy your presence. HOWEVER, the mean guy is not the main character, and many feel you are taking over the blog by posting too much.  And you didn't preface this niche, so Erin, who doesn't know you, obviously thought you were just an asshole (pardon my crude slang).   So, Micheal be your own person, but less often, and Erin, don't ake anything he says seriously.  If he says something that really offends you, don't tell Marten, tell him.  He'll probably apologize.  Otherwise I'll beat him up.  I've probably oversimplified, but that's my two cents. To everyone else who has dissappeared in the midst of all this, come back and do like always.  If you don't want to become involved in a conflict, just ignore it and post normal stuff.  The world needn't stop for Erin and Michael.  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin,  My response is in two parts, you paranoid shiksta feminista. First the part where I mock you mercilessly, then the other part. Keep reading. If you canât scroll down any farther, then close your eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better.  Yeah, it's been a week or so and Michael Christie is still getting on my nerves. [A week? Honey, thatâs like seconds in Michael Time! Iâve been getting on peopleâs nerves for years! Itâs part of my incendiary charm. âMichael] I don't want to be negative, [Little Late for that, donât you think? âMichael] but I hope you realize he is taking over your blog and I would like to know just who the hell he thinks he is. [Sultan of Neptune! âMichael]  Well, I'm not sure if I was the only one who actually wrote angry letters or not. [Yeah, You really were âMichael] I don't think you would rat me out, [Rat me out? Are we in Sixth Grade? âMichael]  but if you want to, let me do it. Let me turn myself in. [Guilty concience, huh? âMichael] In a public exhibition [I believe you mean âforumâ, the phrase is âin a public forumâ âMichael] where I can at least tell him where he is welcome to go. [Chicago? The Ivory Coast?âMichael] He might enjoy his arrogance [Yeahâ¦I really do âMichael], but others don't. [Actually, they kind of do tooâ¦Once again part of my incendiary charm. --Michael] Maybe it would help if I knew him in person, but I don't and he doesn't know me. [See belowâ¦ -Michael] No matter how much he thinks he does and assumes he is welcome to be an ass to me. [Iâm an ass to everybody. âMichael] I've had about enough of that for today. [Awwâ¦Sadâ¦ --Michael] And he knows it was me anyhow. I know he knows. [Yep, absolutely correct âMichael] Perhaps it was the Huttese that gave me away. [Nope you were the only one who doesnât know me and itâs common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. âMichael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that informationânot something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask meâ and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody. [ 	 Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I donât actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Martenâs message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that Iâm obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times Iâm as cute as a little bugâs ear. You just need to realize that I have the maturity of a first grader, and that being sarcastic and mean to you, It just means I like you.

      Michael: As I have been given the go-ahead, I'll save you the trouble of pulling this out of Marten. Yes, as you probably suspected, it was I who wrote the angry letters, though I was not the only one who was angry. Nonetheless, I will answer your particular challenge. And since I have bridged this gap, I may as well provide a translation to my earlier Huttese comment. It means, "The last fool who called me that got his antennae stuffed down his throat. Do you feel lucky, punk?" To that I will add: Kee baatu-baatu. (You bother me.) Kava doompa D'emperiolo stoopa. (You are a low-down Imperial fool.) What? You think it's easy being the Queen? Now, I don't know you, Michael, and you don't know me. But nobody around here appreciates your arrogance but you, and the minute Marten gently tried to inform you of this, you threw a little hissy fit. To put it briefly, I don't like the way you treat Marten, and I don't like the way you refer to others. You are free to "mock me mercilessly," as you put it, but know that I am willing to match you blow for blow, and that I frankly don't care much about what you have to say and thus have little concern for your lack of mercy. I hesitate to pull rank, but... Coughsophomorecough. In conclusion, I cite a quote referring, in case it is unclear, to a certain place over Slice way in Lancre, conveniently located between a Rock and a Hard Place:  "Stuck it up your jumper, sir. Stick it, in fact, up your jumper. Named after Colonel Henri Jumper, I believe. A useful woolen garment akin to a light-weight sweater, sir, which, if I recall correctly, was named after Regimental Sergeant Major Sweat. That, sir, is where you may stick it." -Lieutenant Blouse, Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      I have a new worst day ever story.  My Day with Day.  Most of you know Daniel, or at least have seen him.  I'm gonna give you the short version I gave Sasha when she asked how the movie went.(slightly extended)  We went the wrong way, we got back on track,we arrived half an hour late, we walked around trying to think of something to do, I let a hot girl tell me what to do so we nearly got killed by three thug-looking guys at The House,we decided to go home, the car broke down, the car started again, we got terribly lost (again) and ended up 28 miles out side the city, then we (finally) went home.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Well, My titles always have a tiny connection.  You get to feel smart if you find it.      I was cleaning my room yesterday, and it was practically an archaeological expedition, only without nazis and hot British women. There were a few bits of alien technology; I put them up for sale on Ebay.  Anywho, among the artifacts, I found an old health assignment. It was letter I was supposed to deliver to someone who made a difference in our lives, and mine was full of synicism and young martenesque wit that brought a tear to my eye and laughter to my heart.  Dear Andrew,          In health we have to write to someone who had a big impact on our life, and i chose you. We're writing these things for recognition. You know, why they matter in our lives. We figure if more people knew that they were important, we would have less people committing suicide, or something.         The main reason i chose you is because you are a loyal friend. No matter what I did, you would always try to help, or give me encouragement. Nothing I did would matter, you would always be my friend. I hope it can stay that way. I also chose you because when I get mad I can punch you in the stomach without hurting you... Kidding!         Because of all of the above, I present you with this cheap blue ribbon. Remember, it's the thought that counts. I want you to give the other ribbon to someone who made a difference to you, then explain what the ribbon is for. If you don't, I'll have no choice but to not know about it. But please, don't make me resort to stupidity.                                  Your friend,                                          Marten Dollinger, your future lord and master, as soon as the world acknowleges his global control  ha, good times.  That was in seventh grade. Boy have I changed. mmmyep....  anywho, Michael: I have been getting angry letters about you.  It seems like your taking over the blog.  You need to calm down a bit, I've noticed that you don't post on WKoDhiB as often as you used to, and here I see atleast 2 of your posts between everyone elses. I think maybe you've already scared Thomas away, he hasn't posted since October. Maybe you can lower the post rate and arrogance level just a bit? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Michael's titles always fit the title scheme, but generally have nothing to do with the post.  That's why he never has trouble with his title scheme.  Since he's so experienced at all this, I've decided to follow his lead.  I'll still try to think up sensical titles when I can, but otherwise, total randomness!  It's better than no title at all. Erin: Either one, since I know parodies are what you're best at.  I started a "Look Down" parody about Marvin, but it just wasn't working at all, so I've moved on. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.

Fanfiction recommendation of the week ("You might not care, but I do."): "A Moment in Time" a Star Wars fic on fanfiction.net by Kazzy. It's only 11 chapters long. It's about a not-dead Padme and her twins hiding from the Empire. Very moving and true to the characters, even when they don't do what you want them to. And to boot, it has the Naberries in it! They yell and give hugs! And make food, of course. You know what happened to the only person who ever left that house hungry...   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

Jonah: Machiavellian Macaroni and Cheese! Nathan: Huh? Marten: He's always saying random stuff like that, but it's not nearly as random as my signature lines. Laurence Fishburne: I beg to differ! Marten:  Quiet, you! Michael: I'm more random.  I quote "The West Wing" for no apparent reason. Thomas: Thomas is random. Nathan: Thomas, talking in the third person just isn't hip anymore Micheal: Like you are, ghetto boy!  And why is my name spelled like that. Erin: Because it's his conversation and he can spell it however he wants, Mykelll. Oooh, Penguins! Miecell: That doesn't mean you can! And penguins aren't random anymore! Sophia: Actually, there are real penguins here. Penguins: Sophia, you're so sexy.  Come be our queen. Erin: No fair! I wanna be penguin queen! Lara: Just popping in for my token appearance. Hitler: Dance with me! Lara: No! Sophia: I am the penguin queen.  Fear Me. Nathan (ala Sam Eagle of the Muppets): YOU ARE ALL.... WEIRDOS! Michelle: Shut up, Comstock boy!  Yeah, I edited that post like 6 times.  You gotta problem with that?

      Math sucks.  I've just figured out that if it weren't for math, my GPa would be a 3.6 something.  I'm getting a D in Allgebra II now.  I've never gotten a D on a report card and all be damned if I'm gonna start now. Well, the play is over.  Sasha and I broke up, and I don't really care.  It's hard to say which one of us ended it.   I don't know what Randall's problem is.  He was cast as Lord Montague and Lord Capulets understudy, but Capulet quit.  We worked with him on his diction, but when he got out there it all disappeared.  Jazz show Friday.  Come see it.  I have a duet with Heather Haywood.  It will be fun.  Hip street's performing too, and so is the Jazz band.  Oh, and there's swing dancing.  And jazz.  Lot's of Jazz.  Have I mentioned Jazz?  Unfortunately, I already used All That Jazz. One of my IYC/Speech friends(Amanda, Soph, if you want to know) saw Levi's duo and asked me about the "cute guy with the goatee".  That cracks me up. That last post had a title.  I don't know what happened to it.  Plus my title scheme is way harder than any of yours, so cut me some slack. Michael, as much as I enjoy your posts, you're making way too many.  Try not to post three in a row. Marten, even if we'd had a tech crew, we wouldn't have had backdrops.  Mrs. Means thinks they're tacky. Jonah, I think more profession's should do that.  I'm going to make a movie about Janitors who fight evil blobs of Dirt. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?   No it's not. it's Larry.

      What on earth are you talking about Jonah!?!!!  About your last message?!

We need more archeologists...let them think that all of them are incredibly hot and that the work is interesting...we might learn something!    And I never said I wrote the Mr. T comparison!!!  I agreed with Marten!  Hmmm.  Not sure yet about the JournalCon yet.  Ya'll are still pretty strange.  Do I have to do a conversation?  Cuz it's gonna be super dooper pooper scooper random if I do.

      Creepy.  I could hear Mrs. Horrigan's voice in that convorsation.  Jomah, I did do the Mr. T comparison. Those points belong to me.  You have no settings tab because you lack administrative power.  You need to level up before you can purchase that skill.  Why do you need it, anyway? Michael's only got it because its complicated to teach me how to make links over aim.  I'm making one of my next two posts my unofficial tenth post.  The other one will have my convorsation.    Yar!

      Micheal, what did Laurence say about textual montages? Anyway, these convorsations intrigue me.  Are they a Michael thing, or are we allowed to try our hand? Cause it could be fun...  Anyway, I've decided to make a series of movies: Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Noah's Ark Indiana Jonah and the Temple of DOOMHOUSE and Indiana Jonah and the Second-to-Last Crusade We should do one for XL.    Speaking of which, the media has desensitized the public to the boringness of archeology.  Tomb Raider teaches us that it's a feild full of incredibly sexy women and fighting bad guys.  Indiana Jones teaches us that it's exciting and dangerous.  Stargate teaches us that every artifact you find is a piece of still working alien technology.  This is what young people entering the field expect to find.  What do they do when they find it's mostly just digging up odd-shaped rocks and guessing what they used to be?  I think someone needs to make a film and/or video game about real archeology. As far as my title today goes, it's a line from Moby Dick the musical, unless the line is actually "My men may call it madness." Either way, this one works for me. And Now MttO6 Michael: Either date works for me, I think.  Also, it's Sluggy Freelance Marten: I have no settings tab.  Find out why. Thomas: Congrats on GrandNats. Nate: Good work on the play. Erin: Ooh, it is a penguin Soph: You still haven't answer my last message! Also, the Mr. T comparison was very funny.  You get points.  Yar!

      Hey guys!  Fixed my name so ya'll could figure it out.  lol.  Okay, I feel  kinda  bad about saying this, but,   ROMEO AND JULIET WAS THE FUNNIEST PLAY I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!  Watching Daniel Day as Mercutio...oh my goodness, I had no idea that he was supposed to be so flamboyantly gay!  I'm glad Daniel brought it to my attention.    Nathan, you were really funny as the old man!  Never really figured out who you were supposed to be...but you cracked me up nonetheless!  And as Friar Lawrence, you were great.  I'm really proud that you could memorize those lines...lol I have enough trouble memorizing NORMAL English, let alone OLDE ENGLISH!  Haha, Lord Capulet was the funniest.  Whenever he'd talk...I'd lean over to Kelly and be like..."Did you understand anything he just said?"  And she'd be like, "I have no idea."  lol cuz it sounded like all he was saying ::add lots of dramatic inflections, yet still sounding like a drill sargeant:: "blebleblehblehblehblehbleh."  I really thought he should be a drill sargeant...he'd be good at that.  Shoot, is it spelled sergeant?  I'm confused.  And completely exhausted.  OOOOOOOO GUESS WHO PLACED IN BOTH HER SPEECH ROUNDS TODAY!!!!  I bet you'll NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS GUESS!!!!!!!  Well, actually, Nathan will...cuz he was there...yay speech!  So I'll just tell you.  ME!!!  I PLACED 10TH IN PROSE AND 4TH IN OI!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Okay, that's enough excitement for this issue of Sofa's insane slap-happy hour, please stay tuned for the next episode!

      I would rather like to know what happened to the titles there.  Technical difficulty? Its just those two.    Michael, you would have enjoyed Romeo and Julliett one way or another.  Daniel Day was incredible as Mercutio.  Everything else was fun to make fun of. No offense to nate, mostly it was the tech that made me laugh, and lord capulet's porky-like speech.  And at one point he reminded me of Mr. T.   i pitty the foo who dont marry paris on thursday   As for JournalCon, either date is fine for me, unless one of them is the Chicago trip with Thomas.  I dont like lemon poppyseed.  I demand blueberry.  I think we should watch old batman movies with Adam West.  It makes me laugh.   Erin:  Nicole is an alias.  That's Sophia.  Yar!

      Does Michael not know she's in the blog?  Is she not in it anymore?  Am I in a parallel realitly where she no longer exists? (Come to think of it, I didn't see her after the play with the rest of the Dollingers.)  If the latter is the case, and you all say "Lara Who!?!" then the answer is "Never mind, she doesn't exist here." Anyway, We made Grand Nats Semis.  Unfortunately, we have the first draw and must be at school at 5:00, so I think I'm going to bed.  A few select messages tonight, with no bolding. Soph: Michael's already the funniest, so soon after the extravaganza!?! Jeez! Michael:  Thomas has the best title scheme ever.  Don't be dissin it. Thomas: When you're living in a DOOM HOUSE at the end of the millenium, You're what you own.  Discuss.  Yar! This Be a Superball!... Or Be it!?!?     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?...

      That quote from Wyrd Sisters in honor of Romeo and Juliet, which I am going to see tonight. Break a leg. Nate, I look forward to seeing you in tights. (I think it's possible that I have seen too many of my male friends in tights, what with Marten in the talent show last year and Levi's Cpt. Character.) But geez-- you were home at 8:47? That's not a proper Hell Week! I want to borrow My Ishmael when you're done if I may. Nicole- yes, I will never forget me dancing in my slip and make-up to Chicago in the dressing room, either. :) That was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole play because, well, how often do we get to do that in real life? hehe... Next week I'm going to figure out the deal with my title scheme. Be patient with me till then.  In other news, I got a college application turned in this week! Go me! Yar!

      It's true, Nathan.  The grass is always greener on the other side ::insert witty quip here::.  I'm too lazy to think of a worthy witty quip, so you get to do it yourselves.  Yay.  If I misspell stuff, it's because I can't see because I'm not wearing my glasses, so you are forewarned.  Or maybe I'm just too lazy to press backspace.  Anyways...don'e really know what I was going to say now that I've gotten this far.    Michael, you are the funniest person on this blog.  I really enjoy your posts.

      Great example of the grass being greener on the other side:  When I couldn't get a girlfriend, it was like my one goal in life.  Now that I have one, I really want to not have one.  Or have one who I actually see on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, I can't bare to have her mad at me during the show, so I have to wait on that.    Michael, at least you do improv.  Mrs. Britton hates it.  She won't do any, at all.  And choosing your own monologue isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially since the character has to be close to our own age and the same sex.  I'm doing Peter Wiggin from Ender's Game, btw.  I like being sadistic and manipulative. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      Well, it's the aptly named Hell week.  Having a girlfriend their made it a little better, but she's gotten kind of weird lately and she flirts with Daniel too much.  My time on stage is too scattered.  I don't have long blocks of time offstage.  The good thing is I only have to wear tights for two scenes.  They're not comfy. On a totally different note, I highly encourage you to read  Ishmael  by Daniel Quinn.  I cannot stress enough how important I think it is that everyone read this book.  I'm working on the sequel (parallel novel) and it's not bad, but the first is just overwhelming, and totally defies description.  Read it, then you'll know why.  That'll also explain what the title of this post means.  Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

I just thought you were a weirdo before...now I realize that you're a FUNNY weirdo!  WELCOME TO THE CLUB!!!  (the funny weirdo club and the blog club)  ooh, do you wanna know what would be so cool?!  If we started a club at school for all the people in this blog (cept the Comstocks, of course, unless they want to get bussed over from LN during random SRTs).  I don't know what we'd do exactly...but it'd still be fun!   Erin -lol I will never forget you dancing in your slip and make-up in the dresing room to that exact song (Chicago-title-entry).  And I super-hate days where I would be perfectly content dropping dead.  Marten -You're worried about me "going out" with Larry?  Lol, the "quotes" are because I still think the phrase "going out" belongs back in 6th grade...but whatever.  lol, well, who's to say I didn't start coming to the scene shop to chill with you and Katy and Lauren and such?  It might not have been because I'm "dating" Larry.  (lol, trying to find a word that works for us)  Unfortunately, that is part of the reason why I did end up hanging out there...but I really like it!  You guys are pretty cool!  And what the heck is with this pessimistic foreshadowing?  lol...well...maybe not foreshadowing...but you get my idea.    Nathan -Don't worry about the eating contest...I'm in a beauty pageant in my diary on TOD.  lol, so you're definitely not the most far gone of us all.  :D  hmmm...trying to think of a good signature.

      Yay! Chicago quote! Well, I'm in a much better mood today, folks. Yesterday even Ewoks didn't make me happy. I'm trying to get my friend Marggy to stop hating Anakin Skywalker, so I'm chronicling the transition from Jake Lloyd to James Earl Jones, as it were. It's interesting. And now, a new feature: Erin's fanfiction recommendation of the week. You may never read it or even care, but I do. I recommend "The Winds of Change," a Star Wars fanfic by geo3 on fanfiction.net. It's 38 chapters long now, and very, very good. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      But woulnd it be funny if you did?  I saw you rapping in my head. You had a gold watch and everything. Bling, whatever. Which reminds me, Michael has just recently been made aware of my use of british slang, and has coined the term Blang. I found this hilarious.  Michael is funny. shout out to Michael.  Jonah should spell his name right.  Jonah, with your jubilation and your Konversions, one would think you'd have updated your toaster stories. Am I going to have to finish that for you? Your gonna lose readers.  So Sophia is with Larry now? That would explain you showing up in the scene shop.  I thought it was random coincidence.  How come you didn't tell me? I didn't find out till you were talking to Katie in Physiology,   Oh well.  Still happy. Still worried about it. I feel like a content Arthur Dent, or Rincewind.

      Ever find yourself doing something you find really deplorable in other people?  Yep, I was in an eating contest.  At three and a half plates, I was tied for the second to lowest place, but it was still exciting.  Golden Corral's the best place for it too.  After that we went to Liz's and played Malarky, which I did slightly better at. I've graduated from Leprachaun to Ewok.  Come on Friday, you'll see what I mean.  (Especially if you saw Wizard of Oz).

       Knote: Bekause of the alphabetikal kontinuity of this entry, kreative spellings are konstantly kalled upon  Wow.  I expected more komplaints.  Thomas, Soph, and Marten liked it, Lara didn't komplain, and I don't even know if Erin read it.  I'm still the center of attention, so I'm happy.  However, just for fun, a list of komplaints I half expected to recieve.  I reached ten posts a long time ago and I didn't get a Jubilee! Jubilee is a 25th anniversary anyway. Those are elephants!?! (Okay so I did get that) I never said/sung/rapped that! I would never rap, period. I got shafted because my speech was 90% static! When did Lara write a book? Like you know Laurence Fishburne. Ha! Diddo for J-Lo. and, last but not least, Laurence didn't say "Sip Responsibly" once!  Luckily you didn't komplain so I don't have to answer those.  Anyway, great fun all around and now back to regularly scheduled entries.  And Now Mfto7 (Yep, it says 7)  Marten:   I assume the "most" in "most of that is pretty klose to what would happen if Laurence Fishburne interviewed us" refers to the rap.  Soph:   I think you write your poetry better than I do.  Nathan:  It's more a live elephant  koncept.   Thomas:  It wasn't really that random.  You knew it was koming.  Lara:  You have to make the celebration yourself, y'know.  It ain't easy. And the doomspork is used to eat souls.  Erin:  Welcome to the blog.  Good job on the play.  I don't think you should share title schemes, get your own ASAP:)  Laurence:  Thanks for hosting the show buddy, I owe you one. SKWEE!

      Celebrating 10 posts of Jonah! (Hosted by Laurence Fishburne!)  AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= ^A line of live elephants, because any good celebration has live elephants.   Laurence Fishburne:  Hi, I'm Laurence Fishburne, and welcome to Jonah's Jovial, Jocular J-post Jubilee.  I've been reading Jonah's posts since he began them a little less then a month ago, and they have had a profound influence on me.  I spend so much time reading that blog, that I only did one take of each of the scenes in Matrix Revolutions.  That's why it was so bad.  Keanu Reeves: Also, I can't act!  Laurence Fishburne:   Anyway, that's why I decided to host this special.  And Now, a montage of the best moments of Jonah's fabulous posts.  So I'm joining another blog. Don't expect to hear much from me./For whom are we writing this anyway? For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?/ I just realized that I am really, really sexy. Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy. I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants. I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic./Thomas: Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred. It'd be funny./I was kinda kidding, but whatever./Fighting makes me sad/The moral of this post: Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday!/But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk. In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat. Yay!/Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!    Laurence Fishburne:  I guess Montages work better with something other than text! Next, Blog founder Marten Dollinger will say a few words.  Marten:  Nice work and stuff, I guess.  Laurence Fishburne:  And now, a musical presentation by fellow blogger Thomas, and his band The Fanny Pack Five.   Thomas:  (to the tune of a certian Weezer song.) His name is Jonah, he writes really good posts! He's not from Barcelona, but he makes a mean slice of toast! Come sit next to him, Pour yourself some Slim- Fast, like Granma made when you were on a diet Things were better then, you couldn't eat chicken, You gave up that trend when you didn't lose weight.  This song is not going as planned, The lyrics suck and should be banned, The rhyming is bad when it exists at all, The resemblence to the original is small, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and gone, Yeah they're gone! (Really cool guitar riffs.)   Laurence Fishburne:  Well, now that the audience is gone, it's time for Jonah's brother Nathan to say a few words. (That didn't come out right.)  Nathan:  Jonah's posts have been a true inspiration to me.  A few weeks ago, I was planning to develop an addiction to cough syrup or toad licking, because I couldn't take this cruel world anymore.  Then, I got on the blog and read those beautiful words, "Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall."  Suddenly, it made sense how wonderful this world is.  I've been a staunch supporter ever since!  Laurence Fishburne:  Thanks Nate! Now a poem from blogger Sophia.  Sophia  Thanks Laurence.  This is a poem I wrote for Jonah.  It's called Ode to Jonah.  Jonah is cool, Jonah is neat. If he were a food group, he would be meat. Jonah is sexy, Jonah is cute. He melts number 7 plastic fruit. Jonah writes losts of nifty posts, and according to Thomas makes good toast. Life without Jonah would be sad indeed, Like a yard all full of weeds.   Laurence Fishburne:  (crying) That was beautiful. Now a word from Jennifer Lopez.  J-Lo:  I don't know this Jonah guy, but I want to talk about what the letter J means to me.  Without J, my name would be Ennifer Lopez.  The shortening would be E-Lo, or possibly just Lo.  Either way, I'm glad Jonah's decided to celebrate this letter.  Laurence Fishburne:  Now blog writer Erin will perform a freesyle rap.  This doesn't sound good.  Erin (dressed in baggy clothes and a backwards cap):   Jonah is neat, he's a pretty swell guy, He's had 10 posts, that's more than nine. He knows Laurence Fishburne, and that's pretty rad, He draws people in like newspaper ad. This rap's pretty lousy, I won't say it's not, But hey, I made it up on the spot. So way to go Jonah, for 6 posts plus 4, Here's to the rest, to 16 more! Word.   Laurence Fishburne:  Now, a word from Micheal Christie, who introduced Jonah to blogging.  Micheal Christie:  Jonah's posts are awful.  Originally, he wrote decent posts but now they're all fluff, randomness and meaningless titles.  Although, it's nothing compared to the new Matrix.  Laurence Fishburne was especially...  Laurence Fishburne:  That's enough of that.  Our final writer, Lara, is in Seattle on a book tour, but she's with us via satellite.  Lara, on staticy screen:  Jonah bzzt crckle doom spork bzzz fizzle elephants zzt bzzizle 700 fizzz brzzle pop bzzz much. So, bzzz crckle fzzble a really good pie. Thanks Laurence.  Laurence Fishburne:  Well there you have it, bzzz crckle a really good pie.  How better to describe Jonah then that.   Until next time, I'm Laurence Fishburne, signing out.

      Well, well. It finally has worked! Erin here, I finally got in this thing, so... here I am. Thanks to those who came to see the play-- it did have some great lines, the definitive one probably being "WHAT??" That's a cast joke... Marten is letting me share his topic of subject lines-- quotes from movies and books. That one is from Monstrous Regiment, the newest Terry Pratchett. And now I have to go, for the stage calls me home in about 45 minutes.  SQ(u)EE!

      First off, congratulations to Marten and Soph, the show was excellent.  Now none of us will be able to stop quoting from it.  He He ........ 2000 aeroplanes........he he. Overall, I've had a really amazing day, basically the polar opposite of Jonah's. First period a project I wasn't looking forward to presenting got postponed.  Then in choir, I got a solo from an audition I thought I'd bombed(Laura and Heather got the others, by the way).  In Theatre Arts we broke into work groups of four, except mine only contains two, and the other one is a really hot girl who I don't really know.  In Allgebra II, I actually finished the midterm.  I have absolutely no idea how I did on it, but finishing is a one up from the last test I took in that class. Zach Dzuba played Mandolin for us today.  It was very amusing.  He was borrowing it, but he's saving up to buy his own. Lara. Get. Title. Scheme. NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SQ(u)EE!

      Its true, they are. I was at my friend's house and her parents were talking about it.   Hurray!! I get a doomspork!....what does it do?  One of my friends actually had a relationship for shorter than that.. It was only for 30 seconds but it was forced so it might not really count to you people. Her parents don't want her to date until after high school either. Which brings me to the fact that I have a boyfriend! No Marten you cannot hit him with your stick. He comes to my locker every morning and he walks me to my bus after school and thats almost the only time I get to see him, but oh well.  SQ(u)EE!

      How many day hath past since my last post?   Verily, I say it has been many, for mine post hast passed into the archives like flowers into winter's first snow.   Alas, alas for me, for what shall I say now that I at last post? What news to report?   Random bad things keep happening to me.  Yesterday a saxophone mouthpiece hit me in the head, and I've still got a scab.  Today I threw up for no apparent reason.  I also had a random headache and tripped over a microphone cord somewhere in there.  However, I'm still in surprisingly good spirits, possibly because there is no band practice today.  Also, I'm going to see la obra de teatre de Erin y Marten. (I apologize for the language switch.  When I can't think of an English word I use a spanish one.)  I was thinking about asking a girl to go with me, like on a date, but I probably won't. And now an announcement.  My next post will be my 10th post, and will have a J title.  Since 10 is a milestone and J is the best letter in all the alphabet, it shall have to be an excellent extravaganza of a post.   urlLink An amusing comic.(The beginning may not make much sense, but it's the last panel that's funny.)  Instead of my normal ending section, I'll conclude with this.    Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!

      Well, in the time since my last post I've had my first girlfriend, my first break-up, and the worlds shortest relationship in general.  I was Sasha's first boyfriend too and apparently, her parents don't want her to date until she's out of high school.  Stupid overprotective asian parents.  So my first relationship lasts a day and odd hours.  Wonderful. And I left the stupid Etymology project at school somewher and I have no idea where. I know you don't want to hear about my love life, but I need to vent to someone.  I hope you don't mind to much. SQ(u)EE!

      Romeo and Juliet is officially screwed.  I called for line eight times in the last scene today, six of them on the same monologue.  I'm sure you guys are having hell of it to though.  ABout eight of us are coming out to see you. I have mixed feelings about the crazy hot girl whose been all over me lately.  On the one hand, she's hot and she's all over me.  On the other hand, this is such a sudden change I fear she may be using me for something.  Oh well.  I'm still enjoying the hell out of it. I can't wait to see Camp! Ok, umm, Erin looks nothing like Renee Zwelleger, but it's really funny to imagine her doing those songs.  Deanna was apparently mistaken when she told me Bob Barker was dead; in fact the man who had previously hosted The Price is Right before him passed away.  Soph, it was right before you left, and you gave me a weird look and said, "okay...."  SQ(u)EE!

      Why weren't any of you at speech? It was really fun, even if I did only get 4 1/2 hours of sleep.  I chickened out of talking to Christen and only exchanged a few pleasantries with her brother.  Technically, we were competing in different catagories but I think we got the same number of sweeps points, since LN is really slipping and LC is on the rise.  Oh, plus I got my bronze seal, which signifies my status as ubernifty speechifier.    On the halloween party:  I'm  really  tired.  It was great to see Hannah again, though.  Sorry I tried to kiss you, Soph, it's one of those sudden whims I get.  Who was that Andrew guy?  Does he go to LN or LC?  I've never seen him before in my life. I ate too much.  I'm going back to bed. SQ(u)EE!

      Now it's my turn to say Merry Christmas, Life Day, Hogswatch, or whatever you celebrate. My dad's family is over at my house right now. That's eleven cousins, ladies and gentlemen, plus aunts and uncles. Fun! I almost got to see LOTR yesterday, but at the last minute, I didn't. So I'm probably seeing it next week. Marten-- other things that smell bad, if you're still thinking of doing that parody: we had wookiees and Governor Tarkin, but there's also A Tauntaun and The Inside of a Tauntaun. Enjoy yourself, everybody! That's about all I have to say. I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

Oh, and, Marten, I already do see a psychologist...actually, he's a psychiatrist, so I get meds, too!  Yay!    lol, Nathan, your little silly-thing at the end was the super-greatest.  I love it.

      Merry Christmas or secular holiday of your choice, everyone! Sorry I haven't posted lately, but you wouldn't believe how busy I've been.  Actually you probably would, but I don't feel like telling you all of it.   Last night we watched  The Pajama Game .  Ugh... I'm not sure I even  want  to try out now.  And, just like in  Oklahoma! , the two best songs were left out of the movie, while plenty of awful and/or pointless ones were left in.  Why can't our school do a good musical for once? It doesn't feel like Christmas eve, namely because I've been to busy with totally non-Christmas-related things to be anticipating it all that much.  I haven't finished you guys's Christmas presents yet, either, so don't expect to get them any time near Christmas.  Sorry. In other news,  Return of The King  ruled!  Can't wait for the four and a half hour extended edition.  Or five.  I hope it's five. In other, other news, Charles Dickens'  A Christmas Carol  rules!  Like a bad lobster!  Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid!

      Ha! A christmas title with only Ws! I've still got it! (X is Next, I may have to cheat) Anyways, Merry Christmas Eve and happy Winter Holiday to you non Christians.  (If we have any; I don't think we do)  I had a very weird dream last night.  I became a techie for a scuba-cheerleading squad who traveled around the country in a van.  They ended up switching to regular cheerleading and then acting because times evidentally got tough.  Then, we were stopped in my hometown and I was taking a walk when I saw my dad at a magazine stand that said Comstock  Comstock  Comstock: Booksellers, Arcade Games,  Fun.  I was all like "You started a business without me?" and we was like "Well, you had to run off and join the cheerleading squad."  So I said, "Well, why Comstock  Comstock  Comstock instead of Comstock  Sons?" and he replied, "Well, If you'd been here you might have had a say in the naming process.  That's about all I remember. Lord of the Rings was awesome.  Particularly the Oliphants.  Btw, Trebuchets are in this season, so buy one for your loved ones today.  What better way to say I love you than a giant slingshot that shoots fire? Oh, also I have a girlfriend now, which marks the first time Nathan and I have both had girlfriends simultaneously.  I don't think any of you know her, because she's a Craig person.  For my new section, I have self referencing paper of the day, which is urlLink  "This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found Several Times in the Story Itself"  also, I encourage you to read "Self Reference, which is linked to at the bottom of "This is the Title"  I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

      Mleh to you, Michael.  I'll say what I say and do what I do.  Word.  lol just kidding.  Sorry, just posted a ghetto Christmas poem on my diary and the ghetto-ness is contageous.  Just wanted to wish everyone happy (insert holiday here)!  I hope everyone has  a good holiday and a good break.    You guys' phobias are silly.  I'm slightly arachnaphobic and claustrophobic...but not to the point of whatever.  I suppose I am a little afraid of going into the guys' bathroom, but I think that's just funny cuz it's not like they'd mind if there was a girl in their bathroom, right?  Oh, and, Marten, I hate that feeling...that your fly is unzipped...I always triple check before leaving the bathroom, just to make sure that I'm not showing everyone my pink polka-dotted underwear.  Not that they'd mind.  Again.  oh well.  bye.    Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.

      None of my phobias have names.  When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals.  (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines.  They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer.  They talk, beep, and then just listen silently.  The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly.  Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear.  Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone.  In these cases I'll leave a message.  I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up.  After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either.  So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines. Anyway, if any of you know or would like to make up names for those, please let me know.  In other news, Tales is updated.  Reply to Michael's e-mail already.  I want to change my links to  urlLink 5-minute Voyager  and  urlLink Triangle and Robert  (I'd forgotten how raunchy PWOT was). And please, please help me think of a new title scheme.  Time is running out!  Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. (This is from T btw)

      i was thinking about people of different religions, and people of no religion, and how that relates to me.  I have quite a few friends of different religions, and i thought about free will. We obviously have the right not to believe in God, or Jesus.  Otherwise we wouldn't have free will.  Also, how could people of different religions believe so adamantly in there own as I do in mine if there weren't some truth in it?  In general moral belief, all religions are pretty much the same.  I mean, generally one doesn't hear of actual satan worshiping religions, becasue they'd be out killing everyone including themselves. Of course, if you worshipped satan, you proobably would belive in God and Jesus, you'd just be on the opposite side.  What we do hear about are Extreme Puritans, or terrorists. They aren't always Muslims, they just are currently.  I'm not quite sure where i was going with all this, but its a random thought that hit me.  Discuss.

Although my pointing that out will probably just make you say them more.  And Marten, the word "subjugate" will forever be dirty in my mind.  And Thomas, Sorry if I appeared dodgy, I thought you wanted one of my Twizzlers. And You would have had to have pried them out of my cold dead hands! And Sophia, I believe the quote is a misinterpretation of one of Maya Angelou's poem. The one where she's got oil wells digging in her back yard. Yeah, that one. (if you were in my 9H English class during the interpretive reading of that poem you saw Taylor Sheridan groping himself. Yeah, I wish I had missed it too.)  Does my sexiness offend you?

      I don't want to start a flame war, but Sophia, you're kind of off your game. Take a little break, plan things out, stop using obvious spanish term bands as your title scheme. Take a break over the Christmas holiday. Just the opinion of one man.   Does my sexiness offend you?

      I suck at improv. I guarantee the easiest way to get an A in Drama is to be my partner. Because while you may not get an A you will sure do a heck of a lot better than I did.   Bye Lara. Even Nepotism must come to an end.  READ! THE DAILY! UPDATES!  If you aren't interested in JournalCon, the least you could do is E-mail me and tell me that. As of now, Jonah is coming. Just Jonah.   I'm tired, I'm cranky, and my wife's in Argentina, let's get this over with.

      lol man, my band names are really sucking.  The past three have been "The Men" "The Women" and this one is "My Brothers".  lol all in Spanish, of course.  They're latino bands.  nurr.   anyways, this should probably have a point, huh?  OH!  BYE LARA!!!!!  Now...what else...today was my first day in stage tech since last monday!  Yay!  not really...but I took the test anyway and I'm positive I passed.  Prolly got an A, knowing me.  I'm such a nerd.  :D  lalalalalalalalalalala.  Oh!

Anyways, I'm coming to school tomorrow.  I promise.  You'll just have to listen to me cough all day.  lol I guess the only person I'm really talking to right now is Marten since he's the only one who I see regularly throughout the day.

      Shoutout to Jonah for being the only person who actually listens to really really simple instructions.  Another Shoutout to Jonah, who is (as if we didn't already know) a really good feature writer.  urlLink These  people said so.   It's the 13th of December! Which means that I will begin daily updates of What Kind of Day Has It Been. Yay! Updates. I probably won't post much at Compendium. Actually it's all touch and go because the laptop, which incidentially is older than I am, may not be able to connect to the internet, thus making it worthless to drag out to California as my Carry On Luggage!

I guessed on a couple of yours, but e-mail me if you have none or want some or think that I suck.  Comments are fixed so now Ryan can say that I suck. I guess he saw me do my monologue.

      Shout-out to the nice lunch lady at LN.  The one in the Taco line, with the accent.  She always brightens my day.  Debate! It's a wonderful thing.  We had one today first period and I crushed the opposition (namely Nathan).  I'm curious, Marten.  Who else reads the blog but doesn't write? (besides Ryan).   In terms of the Thomas situation, anytime you see that he's online, IM him with  Post on the Blog!  every five seconds.  If we all do this, he'll have no choice but to comply.  Do not, however, use the same strategy with me and Corndog. In other news, I'm ditching MMtto??? as a section, and I'm going to add something new.  Right now I'm going with random capitalized comment of the entry.  This one is: ARGLE BLARGLE IS NOT MY CHICKEN'S NAME, SO STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY SPLEEN! With any luck, they'll get progressively more random. Michael, explain this shoutout to me please. Sophia, good luck with that I guess, and I hope you feel better, too. Marten, nice endy thingy Finally, Why in the Hellenistic era doesn't the blog link to  Tales , yet!?!?  Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!

      That's kind of what JournalCon is. You celebrate survival and give me tips on how to deal with the heathen monkey. And no, you can't blame everything on Mr. Hall. That's what Mrs. Mohr is for.  Ok, What's next.  Tommy needs to post. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.  Note to everyone. I don't know, I forgot. I probably won't post for a while out of respect for the others in this blog. I'm on hiatus.

She's a bitch on wheels. You can read more about her Memorial Day, 2006 in "Graduation Day, Part Two" coming to Michael's blog soon. Or more specifically less than three years.  PS - I am shutting down What Kind of Day Has It Been...Wait for it...Wait for it...Wait for it...25 August 2006. It's a high school blog, and I have signed a three year, $400,000 per entry contract with Blogspot and Blogger. Don't fret, I am allowed unlimited posts at Compendium, until Marten gets bored, and the Comstocks have to start their college applications (and with all their extra-curriculars, to be considered for the 2006-2007 year, they're going to have to start...right now)  Also does anyone wonder why Thomas is perpetually online, yet never posts?

       Marten: Maybe I have been different.  I can't tell anymore.  I think that the fact that I'm super pmsing *I know ya'll didn't want to know that, but figured it might explain something*, and suspect that I have the flu might just have put enough stress on me to act like a major bitch.  I don't know.  I'm sorry for doing whatever I did and for having a hard time.  Please forgive me.    Michael: Thanks for standing up for me...I think...lol I didn't really understand what you were doing with that post, but I recognized that you were telling Marten off just as much as you were telling me off.  So thank you.  Nathan: yeah, as you can tell, girls are weird.  We're all weird.  It's just part of our physiology...I'm surprised there isn't a specific gene that makes a specific protein (Woo hoo Mr. Lamishaw's class!) that makes us stranger than you.  Who knows.  But, yeah, it's the whole "I want what I can't have" mindset that's making these chicks *did I just say chicks?!* swoon over you.  and I'm happy that you're happy with Ashley!  :D

I'd also appreciate it if you didn't blatantly insult my friends online.  Nate:  um... yeah.... girls are weird.

      I've figured out how my luck with girls works!  It's not that they don't pay any attention to me at all.  It's just that they do it in clumps!  Whenever I commit myself to a relationship, it seems 2 or 3 incredibly attractive girls who never payed me any attention before start hanging all over me and pouring out there hearts to me, because now I have to tell them to stop.  There was Sarah and Sasha, and now that I'm so happy with Ashley, of course a really hot girl starts talking to me about how lonely she is and how I'm the only nice person there.  Mind you, given an actual choice between those two, I would have chosen Ashley anyway, but I still wish that sort of thing would happen to me when I'm single. Sorry if I bore you, that's my life.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      I am an instigator. I am a scrappy terrier that will chew your leg off if you look at me funny. That's why what I'm going to say is going to be more shocking than the last five minutes of a majorly-hyped Law and Order episode.  Sophia and Marten are being childish and need to bury the metaphorical hatchet.  You know Marten, you're the administrator of this blog and I respect that. However I think your indignation towards Sophia is covered in crap. Petualantly hiding away and editing posts isn't going to make this go away. Okay, Sophia may have offended a loyal reader. Big Deal. That's not nearly as bad as the time when I told Erin that my post may be so asinine she should "close [her] eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better" If you would have let this g, talked to her face to face, and I'm not just talking about the Ryan Hagan post, but rather the calling here bitchy, than this would have been a non story. But instead you openly attack her on the blog, which automatically put her on the defensive. Now Sophia's mad and you're mad and the rest of us are caught in the crossfire. But if you insist on starting things, than you better finish them completely, because if you just hide away than I will wait in the tall grass for you, Marten, because you are killing the blog.  I'm not saying that Marten was the only one wrong in this argument. I have once (spectacularly) gone off on someone and made mountains out of molehills. But Blatantly attacking a read with no reason given to this sudden outburst is just confusing and apparently unacceptable. If you are going to hate something you need to give a reason, because otherwise you look petty and small. And Believe me, I know petty and small. But you have to remember that I openly apologized and extended an olive branch once I realized that I was wrong and that my comments were offensive and petty. So If you don't stop being "bitchy" and apologize to both Ryan and Marten, than you are just as wrong as Marten is, and someday we may look back and realize that Compendium, what was a Utopian Shangri-La for hilarous intellectuals, failed because petty squabbling between the writers.  I may be hypocritical for saying this. I might me monumentally out of line. I am pretty sure I looked back five minutes ago and saw that line that you don't cross with an administrator fading away in the rear-view mirror. Marten, If you don't want to apologize, If you believe that you are absolutely right, than I accept that. But if you believe that you were wrong and are just afraid to swallow your pride and apologize, then God, Marten. I don't even want to know you

      Shoutouts to Rachel Griffiths (who had a baby), Tom Cruise (who got a haircut), The cast of The OC (who are #1 on the TV list of breakout stars of 2003) and Keira Knightsley (who is number one in movies)  C.J.: Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President? MRS. LANDINGHAM: They seem to be having a disagreement. C.J.: A disagreement or a fight? MRS. LANDINGHAM: Well, it certainly has the potential... BARTLET [OS] [shouts]: Oh, for Godâs sakes Toby! MRS. LANDINGHAM: There we go.  Oooh, Chickfight on the blog. Ten bucks on Sophia. Any takers?  The Following is the expressed opinion of Michael Christie, and does not reflect the views of Marten Dollenger or the Staff of Compendium of Stupidity  I think that it would make sense if Sophia gave a reason why she hated Ryan Hagan. That would explain why. Also I find it somewhat shocking that Marten actually edited a post.  I'd also just like to congratulate Compendium of Stupidity on three months online.   Also I'll be posting a piece on weddings, currently titled "Untitled Michael Christie Blog Post". It's so delightfully meta, don't you think?  The Obligatory Television Without Pity quote. These will appear until y'all visit.  Pamie: That damn SuChin is finishing up.  Stee: Now, SuChin...she won a contest, right? She's not actually a VJ. Please tell me that.  Pamie: She does that thing to me that happens to Kramer when he hears Mary Hart's voice.  Stee: I'm gonna interview you in the style of the MTV Video Music Awards opening.  Pamie: Okay. And I'll do it like a guy who's there.  Stee: "Okay, okay! So Pam! I mean, I mean...! Hey, there's...! I'm standing...! Hey! I...there's....! Thanks, Kurt! I'm standing here on the red carpet with...Pam--"  Pamie: "Right, right, true, true!"  Stee: "So, Pam! This is absolutely amazing here tonight, isn't it?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, I've been, I mean, you know. I'm just here. I'm just sayin'. You know, everything's been a really good year and we're all just really happy about everything--"  Stee: "--Is--?"  Pamie: "--and how everything has worked out."  Stee: "Now, isn't our red carpet really red?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, it's like, yeah, I mean, it's like, crazy, man, it's like, amazing."  Stee: "Now, I understand that you, uh, don't like Kurt Loder. Is that true?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying. Everybody has like, things going on and stuff and it's like, you kinda, you know, you work through it. You know, and everything. But my new album, CHICKEN AND RED MEAT, drops October7th, and that is what it's all about. CHICKEN! CHICKEN! OCTOBER SEVENTH!"  Stee: "All right..."  Pamie: "WOOOOOO!"  Stee: "How many, how many hours a day do you watch MTV?"  Pamie: "What? I'm sorry, I was talkin' to my boy! That's my boy right there! T-Bok! And T-Bok, come over here, T-Bok! Woooo!"  Stee: "I forget..."  Pamie: "WOOOOO!"  Stee: "I forget who I'm...who you're talking to."  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying."  Stee: "Hey, fat guy! Uh...Sway! Umm...."  Pamie: "Wooo! October 7th!"  Stee: "SuChin! Someone help me!"  Pamie: "October 7th! October 7th!"  Stee: Man.  Pamie: And now...the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards! In the hizzy! -Pamie and Stee on The MTV Video Music Awards. The Hilarious Title of the Recap is "Yo Yo! Our Recap Drops On September 8th! Hollah!"  Seriously there is something for all of y'all. Children of Dune recaps for the Comstocks. Regina's Alias Recaps for Marten. I don't know what Thomas, Sophia, Erin or Lara watch, so I guess there are only things for the Comstocks and Marten. Never mind.

      This is a parody I just finished from our hypothetical musical  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Ithaca .  To the tune of the Stones' "Wild Horses".  Enjoy!  Gods in heaven, itâs easy to do The things you wanted, we sacrificed them to you Immortal Lady, you know who I am, You know you canât let me lose to Priam  All our forces, couldnât get into Troy All our forces, couldnât get into Troy  Youâve watched us suffer, fighting in vain, Helen is still there, inside their domain No sweeping exits from enemy lines Could make us feel bitter and leave her behind  Men and horses, could get lost in the fray All our forces, still would not go away  I know Iâve dreamed of getting inside And Meneleaus, would get back his bride Walls would be broken, Tears would be cried All of the Trojans, soon will have died  Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy  Large, Wheeled horse, could get us into Troy Trojan forces, we soon would destroy  To be perfectly honest, Jonah came up with the idea and part of one of the verses.  It's still sort of a work in progress, so any suggestions would be appreciated.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Marten - No Hipster Flare sounds like a pair of pants. Also the socratic thing got blown to hell once you hired me. Because while it maybe interesting. It just ain't funny. Nathan - I'm now the president of yo' mama! Bow before me, The President of the Kingdom of Ma Hornbeck! Erin - Queen of the Trees? Do tell. Also did you see your love thread on the forums. There's a link somewhere around here. Also everyone loves Ewan McGregor!...That sounded straighter in my head. I'm sorta having a gay day today. Sophia - As Do I. Though It would be sad if he saw this and slit our throats while we were sleeping. But not together. Although I wouldn't mind sleeping together. Because I'm straight.   I was at Bethlehem Village tonight and wasn't able to mod the thing. It's okay, y'all didn't seem interested anyway. I'm [illegally] downloading the second season premiere of The West Wing, In The Shadow of Two Gunmen, Parts One and Two. They won the Emmy for best writing in an episode. They also reveal "Who's been hit! Who's been hit!" (I sincerely hope it's not CJ. Allison Janney rocks. And According to EW Allison Janney was the best thing to happen in that stupid Mandy Moore movie "How To Deal".)  I don't know what else to say, so I'm just going to quoteTelevision Without Pity You don't care, but I do [tm Erin]  "Paris and Nicole are giving interviews on a red carpet for the premiere of their show. The interviewer asks if they are ready for this. I think a better question is, "Are we, the viewers, and in fact all of America, ready for this?" And the answer is, "It's December and sweeps are over, so why the hell not?"" -Kim on  The Simple Life

      In case some people haven't heard me say this yet, go see Love Actually! Great movie. Not just one happy ending-- but lots!  This weekend I am finishing college and Prelude applications, studying for precal test, working on research paper, memorizing my lines as queen of the trees, and making elf hats. Hopefully somewhere in there I will fall unconscious and not wake up until December 20.  I am six lines away from being finished with my latest parody, "At the End of the Day- Naboo Style!"  I have a horrible suspicion that, were there to be an online Socrates Cafe, I wouldn't have enough time to attend.  Jonah's blank entry leads me to suspect that he may be the Phantom Menace. I have a bad feeling about this...  Segue to Erin's Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do."): The Shifty Troublemaker, a TPM parody on fanfiction.net. This piece is very clever: frequent references are made to George's quest for more money through spectacular marketing and his love affair with impressive CGI creations such as Jar Jar and the Wizard Eopies, not to mention the Lego (tm) Podracers. Anakin has tourette's. Coruscant is one giant disco bash. Qui-Gon loves his drugs and perhaps a certain young Scot. This fanfic is the origin of the infamous penguin line. Need I say more?  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

      I love drama!  More on that later. I would be scared if Michael were president of anything.  More on that would be superfluous. I think an online socrates cafe would not work at all.  everyone would be talking at once and so the discussion would be somewhat stunted.  That happens on all chat rooms and I doubt this one would be any different.  So for now I'm gonna say no.  Even  if  Christen's there, seeing as I have a girlfriendwith whom I'm quite happy. Ok, Drama.  Today in our scene groups we all got the same scene, but we had to figure out what the somewhat cryptic dialogue was about, and make up motions to go along with it.  It was really fun. I have four essays to write.  That makes me sad ): But Drama, Ashley and the fact that it smells like Christmas make me happy (: Jonah: How about AB, then AC, then AD, etc.  either in the first word or the first and second?

Just grab a frappuchino and IM me at SBristowSD6 so I can let you in. I probably won't talk much, cause I'd be doing other stuff, but I can create private chat room (I don't know if all of you with AIM can do that. If you can then someone else will do it.)

      The end is near! Z is fast approaching, and the end of my title scheme with it.  My options are: Switch to numbers (Very Difficult) Use double letters (Difficult unless I'm posting about different sizes of batteries or BB guns) Start over at A (Boring) Make up a totally new scheme (Conceptually painful- I stand to lose my alphabetical identity)  So, as you can see, they all have disadvantages, so your suggestions would be appreciated.   Second, the blank page. When I saw it, I thought it was either the stupidest or  most brilliant thing I'd ever seen.  But I didn't want to dis it without trying it, so I made a blank post.  And it was refreshing.  If nothing else, it stimulated conversation. Sophia - That sounds like a great idea, but for me a big part of Socrates Cafe was being on a coffee high, so I don't know how much I'd enjoy the discussion without it.  Out of curiosity, how is Guthrie limiting the numbers? Fourth order of business, my life is crazy.  Just for fun, I'm going to list all of the things that contribute to that.  Band Things  Marching band Fiesta Bowl Prep Pep Band rehearsals and games ISSMA Solo and Ensemble contest Concert band concert in a week  Church Things  Choir cantata and rehearsals Pagaent and rehearsal(s) Youth Group (Tiny Tim) Brass Quintet Brass duet with Thomas  School Things  Book Report/ Reading of book for World History Debate in Lyceum Next issue of North Star Regular Homework  Other Things  Speech Supporting the craziness of others (attending choir, orchestra concerts) Eating Sleeping Trying to have a social life  Wow, 18.  That's more than I would have thought.  Anyway, that's pretty crazy, so if I don't post again before January, that's why.    What's the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

      lol, I thought Jonah's intentionally-left-blank post was quite refreshing.  :D    Now, I was struck with a brilliant idea and was wondering if you all would be interested in joining/helping me.  Since Guthrie started limiting the number of people allowed to attend Socrates' Cafe, not everyone can go.  Which super-sucks.  So I was thinking that maybe if we started an INTERNET Socrates' Cafe, more people could join and we could have a more interesting, philosophical time on the internet!  So I propose a Socrates' Cafe CHATROOM!  Who's with me?!  Oh, and, Michael, that date is my mommy's birthday!  Just fyi!  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

      Yeah, Jonah that was stupid. If you want to see blank pages just...open up blank word documents like normal people.   PS: Join the Forums! They're cool and hip and happening! Also If no-one joins, then it disappears the 29th of December.

      Guess what? You want to hear about my day? I actually stayed awake in Algebra. I made spaghetti in Nutrition and Wellness. We talked about Russia and Napoleon's Penis in Japanese, and I impaled myself on my monologue in Drama. See, this is why I don't try new things, It turns out they're either boring or I'm really bad at them. Carmela! Get me a Vodka Tonic and some lighter fluid. Daddy wants to fly! Yes I'm talking to you, you wayward Cabana Girl. Now Go!   Also I just found out that unemployed sitcom writers wear tweed. Who knew?

      Shoutout to Tim Dinger, who I think is a butthead, but he'll never find out because he's anti-blog. I have great Tim Dinger stories. Not to mention a really really funny one about Daniel Day. Remind me to tell you that one soon.  Now Nathan, I'm sure that Ioians and Ganymedians are also ungrateful and mean. Astronomy humor. Doesn't go over well with people.  The Europeans have always been mean. I've known that from the beginning of sixth-grade social studies. Europe has frequently been the enemy, just look at almost everyone of our wars has had a European enemy or been instigated by Europeans. Look at the Revolutionary War. Look at World War One. Look at Nazi Germany. Look at Russian History. (By the way, Nathan, I would highly recommend majoring in Russian History. Fascinating stuff. Even as late as 1917, Russian history has been turbulent and nebulous) Vietnam was started, indirectly by the French, British and Americans snubbing Ho Chi Minh at one of the summits after World War II. The British used Opium to get the Chinese high and take advantage of them. The Dutch did the same thing to Indians in order to acquire Manhattan Island in New York. Of course the Europeans are mean nasty and horrible. Even now most of them still are. While I have mixed views on the war in Iraq, I think that after saving French Ass in World War I and getting Germany back on it's feet after the calamitous forty-year period of War and death had to count for something. The British backing us proves that they are truely the best ally we have at this point.   I wonder how long a tangent I can go on before you all stop reading.   I think the Spanish Conquistador's behavior speaks for itself. They wiped out two advanced civilizations for gold. I think that was just greed for the point of greed. And look at Columbus. And I don't even want to bring up the fact that we gave them all Syphillis. The Swiss are probably the nicest people in the world at this point. Except for Heidi. She's a bitch.  That's my entire view of imperialization. And Nathan (last line "Especially Islam. If I were them, I'd be mad too.") I think you meant to say the Arabs who have gotten screwed over a great many times by the west. Although we had no business arming them in Afghanistan back in the eighties, then running away with our tail between our legs after Yeltsen took office. We should have worked with the Afghans, set up a government and then backed away. That (indirectly) led to Terrorist Attacks over the last ten years, including the Apartment Buildings in Riyadah, The American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam and the one that hit closest to home, the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Offtopic (even more than I am right now),   JONAH: Cornblog is a very stupid idea. Try something like "The Blogs of War". That will make sense after you read Julius Caesar. SOPHIA: Queen Mary? Cool. ERIN: I think I saw you this morning, but I may not have. How do you know in a school of 1,700? THOMAS: How's Columbo? LARA:ummm...Bye! I think this is it for me for a while. I'm tired and have quite a bit of work to do. I'll just leave you with this thought: "Fish Are Friends, Not Food."

      Ok, here we go.  From Jonah's list, a question about an  interesting topic. Why is history so Eurocentric? I'm really enjoying world history, despite Mrs. Layman and Spodek.  You know why?  Because, while I'm not getting a balanced perspective, I'm finally getting enough of one to see Europians for what they really are: fakes, thiefs, rip-offs.  Ungrateful, and often down right mean.  I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing.  Europeans have only been the big players for  maybe  six hundred years.  The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long.  Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long.  But what do we learn about as kids?  The last 200 years.  The ones that involve America.  Maybe a little about Europe. I've been thinking a lot about my career plans, and I think I want to major in Medievil history and minor in theatre.  I'll probably still end up a teacher, but if I must teach, I'd rather teach history, and try and help kids get a somewhat better rounded view of the world.  Especially Islam.  If I were them, I'd be mad to.

      There was a mass suicide and I wasn't invited? Gasp! Anyway, I'm in Journalism SRT, and I'm supposed to be silent reading.  Anyway, I think people aren't posting because they don't know what to say.  So, I'm taking it upon myself to reaffirm what the blog is for.  -- Posting interesting developements in your life that are not gossipy or girl/boy crazy. -- Posting Philosophical quandaries about random or interesting topics, like time or love. -- Relating interesting facts about stuff like cod or England -- Posting amusing anecdotes (funny is good) -- Convorsations!!! -- Suggestions for improving the blog, or for other bloggers, like this one.  You all have atleast one of these in your head now, so post.  Or face the consequences.   It's okay! I had Subway!

      Live From Indianapolis, It's Friday Night!  I just want to say a few things. The first of which I'd like to say this. I'd certainly enjoy reading  The Complete Works of Erin Chandler . And that  Ewok  didn't look bad either. On this being an "LC Blog":Suck it up and deal, Nathan. You spent a good part of the car ride to Taj of India discussing people at LN I've never met. You want an LN Blog? Create your own. You can do that. You can create a blog just to discuss things at LN, but I will rise up an army and I will beat you. (I was paraphrasing Leo's speech on why A Proportional Response makes more sense than the disproportional response Bartlet suggested. Yes I'm just rambling here. Also I just realized that we have like eight of us here already (but only six who regularly post) But seriously that's a lot of bloggers, yo. I'm just making my point, and also using the phrase "Suck it" which I've always wanted to do. Also Nay on Flame War!  Also Jonah is totally hot!  Also speaking as a Republican, we really really need Dean or Sharpton in the White House. Not for their policies, but rather for the entertainment value. Also there needs to be a more charasmatic Republican candidate in 2008. I mean I'm talking Bartlet here.  Alright, Nay on syndication!  Also I'm introducing what, until I get bored of it, will be my new feature  GOOGLING MEMBERS OF THE BLOG!  I searched "Jonah Comstock" and there were four hits: The newspaper thing, the Indianapolis Children's Choir (Nathan was also there), Some random old thing and Corndog.  Now apparently from the Nathan hits, Our Nathan is the first "Nathan Comstock" to be born in...about one-hundred years. Seriously people.    The Nathan Comstock Timeline  1725: Nathan Comstock Born 1735: Nathan Comstock Born 1746: Nathan Comstock Born 1760: Nathan Comstock's daughter was born.  1776: Nathan Comstock Born 1786: Nathan Comstock Born 1802: Nathan Comstock Born 1806: Nathan Comstock Born 1809: Nathan Comstock was a Commissioner of the Poor in Palmyra, New York.  1816: Nathan Comstock built a cabin in Rockport, New York 1827: Nathan Comstock signed a petition having something to do with a highway in Michigan.  1862: Nathan Comstock Born  Nathan Comstock is: a Freshman Senator at Emory University, a High School Tennis Captain in Georgia, and a marathon runner in Michigan.  Thank you and Good Night!    2 links of 252 actually were Nathan Comstock. Funny, Huh?

      Actually its evening, but oh well.  I still have a bunch of random stuff to say. You know what's creepy?  Hearing your friends argue about whether or not your brother is hot.  Especially when one is a guy.  That's just my major weird experience of the day. If the constitutional amendment banning gay marraiges manages to pass, I'm going to stage a coup and overthrow the government. We need more LN people on this blog.  I move to invite Tyler Rudd or Paul Simmons.  Somehow this has turned into an LC blog with a couple of LN guys and that's not what it was supposed to be at all.  It makes me feel left out sometimes.  I also think you guys are being a little hypocritical in discussing LC teachers who Jonah and I have never met. No on Syndication. One: why do we want readers?  Two: Who would want to read any of this?  I think syndication is vain and pointless. I'm really sick of my title scheme, so as soon as I think of a good one I'm going to change it.  Just a bit of warning. Ok, none of that had anything to do with the rest of it, but thats ok.  Please don't get offended and try to start a flame war.  Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      I hate Mr. Phillipy  I hope both he and Mr. Hall get married to eachother and die on their honemoon.  Or it would have to be a civil union thanks to stupid President over there in Washington...I don't even know if THOSE are legal here.  Stupid conservatives.    Anyways.  Mr. Phillipys such an asshole.  I agree with everything you said about him because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking...he thinks he can read Cyrano's part when there are so many people in our class who could do SO MUCH BETTER!  He's an awful speaker and he's so random.  I hate him, I hate him, I HATE HIM!  I've just had awful luck this year with gay English teachers, have I not?    I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR SAYING "OUR" FUNNY!!!    He can't even TALK about accents, stupid Pe-ru man.  Grrrrrrr.  And the whole "Bless you" thing?  Grrrrrrrrrr.  You enjoyed my pissed off acting?  I would've thought it was quite funny as well if it hadn't been me he was making fun of.  Asshole.  Nobody makes fun of me and is still my friend.  Unless if they're joking...I'm good with jokes.  But he's not joking.  He's dead serious about making fun of the way I say "our".  Eat me, Mr. Phillipy.  (Now I understand why it definitely isn't a good idea to syndicate this...sorry about the profanity guys...and about the awful comments...just sorry for making you read all of that!)

      Ha! Sophia,  you made my day.  Phillipe isn't much better, is he? What a yutz.  The guy is a horrible speaker.  We're reading Cyrano, and our teacher thinks he can read the lead.  The guy has no prose skillz. can't act.  Plus, or minus, as the case may be, hes a bloody hypocrite, he's rude, and has to have the stage constantly.  He'll cut people off on questions and go on scripted tangents.  I think he decides exactly what he's going to say before hand and if you don't follow his script hes just going to block you out.

      Do you all know how much I love snowblowers. Seriously, It took me fifteen minutes to clear off the driveway. Which is awesome. And I did it while listening to a .wav I ripped from the  urlLink cheerleading episode  of Joan of Arcadia.  Also Yay for Snow Days!  Also we can syndicate our blog. I know how to do it. It would expand our audience, which would be a good thing. Then again with some of the things said about a certain speech teacher, it may not. I'm syndicating What Kind of Day Has It Been. Just so you know.  Syndication: Yay or Nay?

      This is the last post to utilize the stupid and tedious alphabetical title scheme.  My next post wil began a totally new scheme.  But I've finally figured out what my regular section will be: Match up of the week.  This week:  Who would win in a jousting match between Helen Keller and Larry the Cucumber if Larry was riding a giant corn chip with legs and Hellen Keller was riding a potato chip of equal size with wheels? (They are both using chocolate lances, but Helen Keller's is dark chocolate and Larry's is milk chocolate)  Most of the matches will pretty much be like that.  Also, "of the week" does not mean there will be one each week.  There will still be one per entry, regardless of how they spread across weeks.  Erin, please read the comments on the posts for information about your books.  Do you think I could borrow Monstrous Regiment if I promise to read it quickly?  (Easy enough.  TH White is good, but his books take signifigantly longer to read than Terry Pratchett, whose books I have more than once read in a single night)  Also, I am surprised that Celebration is coming here again.  Pleasantly surprised though.  And this time, we'll get organized enough to enter the costume contest for real. I'd like to conclude with the word Eggplant.  But I won't, because this sentence is here.   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

I was expecting, now that I am queen I want title scheme of my own, or something closer to that quote. precious is too predictable for the times.  I'm betting Nate's the feminist and Heather's the communist. Oh, and Nate's hairstyle is now officially known as a lutefisk.  It's a Norwegian dish of cod soaked in lye.

      Erin, Word on the Golden Globes. Apparently we'll get to also see Jack "Sunglasses at Night" Nicholson knock the microphone stand back and forth. My parents asked me what the difference between the Golden Globes and the Oscars were, the main differences being these: The Golden Globes are held in a Hotel Ballroom, usually the Beverly Hilton and the Oscars are held in a theatre, usuallyThe Shrine Auditorium near USC, The Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, or the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center, Downtown (I suppose the new Gehry designed Walt Disney Music Hall is a possibility, unless the Philharmonic Orchestra are performing)  This tangent has been brought to you by NBC, the only place to see the 2004 hooker-infested Olympic Games in Athens and Drunken Celebrities at the Golden Globes.   Also the fact that the nominees and attendees sit at tables, rather than in a big theatre. Also they drink heavily.   There was really no point in me writing this entry except to say that I know a lot about the Golden Globes and Los Angeles, and you don't.  Also Erin, Nathan told me he lost your book.   Oy, With the Fishcakes Already!  (The template thing should be italicized, as not to drag attention away from the entry)

      all night, but oh well.)  In other words, show choir hell has officially started with 21 hours of Choreography in three days.  On the plus side, this show rules!  It is very awesome and I urge you to come see it.  Especially if you want to see me being ghetto, and all of our girls doing Kung Fu. (Actually it's more like kick boxing, but some of these girls trying to pull off 'tough' are downright hilarious.  Especially Amy and Laura.)       So yeah, if you think you've had an exhausting week, I advise you to think again.  Equally frustrating is that there is absolutely nothing cool for small, lightweight guys to do in a show choir show, and they won't let the girls lift me.       In other news, Heather Haywood and I are writing a scene together in Theatre arts about a feminist, an environmentalist, and a communist.  I think you can guess who I'm playing.

I'm really tired right now, cuz I just got home from a party (lots of drugs and sex, guys, I had a great time.  :D) and I only got 2 hours of sleep between the speech meet from hell and the party.

      My new semester schedule contains one highly awesome element:  As many lunches as I want!  Ok, well technically just whichever lunch I want but I can get away with more than one easily.  It just so happens that my North Star period (which is during a beginning journalism class, so I'm the only one in it) is during a lunch period.  Since I'm one person and the administration won't notice, Hayes said I can go to any lunch I want.  First day I went to two and he didn't notice.  If he asks, I was doing interviews. But other than that, the new schedule kinda sucks.  Two new teachers, one boring but nice and one who I thought was mean but she's just old.  I guess overall it's a wash.  In other news, The Pajama Game is a sexist musical.  It has three or four girls chorus songs, no guys songs and only about three that guys even sing on.  Being male chorus is quite pointless, particularly knowing I will be cut from all the dance numbers.  I'd better get lines, or else this musical will be a huge waste of my time.  There is one post left before the alphabet fails me, so please tell me what to do. Marten, you should bold the end thingy in the template so it doesn't blend with everything else.

      Wow, what a weekend.  I planned a lot of stuff.  A lot of stuff happened.  I didn't plan all the stuff that happened.  It was fun anyway.  Hurray for Yo Yo Ma! Incase we have any uncultured whelps reading this blog, he plays the cello.  He plays it well.  Hurray for Momas who got tickets to see Yo Yo Ma!  If there's anyone here who doesnt know who Momas is, she is the mother of Thomas.  Mom + Thomas = Momas.    Then I came home.  Then I went away again.  Off to Christin Neary's birthday party.  Good food. Lots of people. and notice the sentence fragmens? Good device. Will be used more later.  Anywhy, parts of it were fun, other bits tasted good.  However, there was quite a bit of negative-marten energy there, so I was, for the most part, canceled out.  Sounds silly, but what can I do?  After that, Big Fish. It was fun. See What Kind of day has it been.   michael what did I say about using the word props?  This blog depicted here shall possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works.

      And so were the recaps. Seriously people, if you aren't watching  Joan of Arcadia , you should be.  Here's an excerpt from the fabulous Deborah's recap to entice you to watch... I'M QUOTING! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATE PEOPLE DO! DON'T HURT ME!  "Kevin wheels into the kitchen, where the rest of the family is getting breakfast, reading the newspaper on his lap aloud to all: "'Chief Girardi's courage in confronting the corruption that has plagued Arcadia for years cannot be underestimated. He should be treated as a hero, not a pariah.'" Joan finds this odd and asks, "One of those flesh-eating Amazonian death fish?" Luke: "That's 'piranha.'

      Okay, so it's not an actual quote, but I succesfully combined Lord of the Rings with Once in a Life Time. I get props. who coined that? Props to so and so. its actually kind of stupid and I never wat to hear it said again. Unless the speaker is refering to actual props for a play or something.   Ok, Michael, Im going to read the Alias recaps for the episodes I mised on TWoP.  Also, I'm going to ignore the squabble because I wasn't here. Also because I have divine right as administrator.  And because I think squabble is a dumb word.  reminds me of bad seafood. and notice the sentence fragments? good device. will be used more later  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      I'm in the Newspaper!  Page N-1, Star North section, "Students are all talk at contest".  Just wanted to point that out.   I'm under serious finals/beginning of show choir season/end of speech season strees right now.  In a week like this, anything can make my day.   Micheal- TwoP is really good.  I wish they reviewed SG-1, though.

      Joan Girardi has one. Rory Gilmore has one. Sydney Bristow has one. keckler has one. John Carter has one. Seth Cohen has one. Laynie Hart has one. Now Michael Christie has one too. I have an iPod! I finally fixed the port and I have music on there. Right now I'm listening to music from Finding Nemo.  There are about 11 intended links supposed to be up there. If you don't know who any of these people are, you don't watch enough TV. However, I'm nice enough to give you an idea: Joan of Arcadia, Gilmore Girls, Alias, Enterprise (recapper), ER, The OC and Everwood. Just go to your friendly search engine and type in "Television Without Pity" I promise I'll read a webcomic if you do this.

      I, too, am ignoring that squabble because it's over and moving on to say: That was definitely the best Joan of Arcadia ever! Hooray for Joan... or Jane, if you so prefer... and Adam! Good ripples all around. And definitely no weird scary koala bears in hats. Also, everyone, go see Big Fish. It is officially out now, and I saw a preview of it and it is such an awesome movie. It made me cry and laugh and everything. It's a brilliant film. Jonah, I want The Once and Future King back. Also The Da Vinci Code from Levi. You guys have had those for like six months. I've decided that I'm fixing the fanfiction recommendation of the week on Saturday, so here it is. You might not care, but I do. Another Lifetime by Kazzy, again for SW, again on fanfiction.net. I do read other fandoms and other sites, but these have just updated more. It's an AU where Padme doesn't die and is raising the twins, hopping from one planet to another and staying one step ahead of the Empire. Some very cute stories.  I shall now push "post and publish."  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Nathan, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I completely and totally over-reacted.  And the rest of you thought this post would be all hostile.  Best Joan of Arcadia Ever! Yay! If you aren't watching now, you should be!  Here's the part of the post that was nice...  2.18 - 17 People  The episode that set up sweeps week, as well as the future of the show. Bartlet's MS is revealed to Toby, who freaks out and tears both Leo and Bartlet new cornchutes. (I actually would have enjoyed a scene where he goes off on the first lady and she slaps him. But this is a serious episode...) Meanwhile Sam and Josh try to write jokes for a speech for the Correspondent's Dinner. Sam invites Ainsley up to write jokes and the end up debating the Equal Rights Amendment. Powerful episode, masterfully captured by Alex Graves, who is probably the most talented director on the show since Schlamme left. Great acting from Marten Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Rob Lowe. However Richard Schiff turns in a powerhouse performance and steals the show and runs.  Also I don't understand dell. What is a dell exactly? And what does Dell Computers's catch phrase "Easy as Dell" mean. Cause it's stupid and I don't get it!

      Micheal, I typed a rather long rant in reply to you, but then I deleted it.  I'm mad rght now.  I was already mad when I read you're post.  I snapped on five people today including both of my choir teachers.  So I figured it would only start a flame war.  So now I'm going to apologize for not explaining myself on the D topic, concede that I should have, and agree not to discuss it here.   I will not make the same concession for webcomics unless you do for TwoP, The West Wing, and basically every T.V. show you talk about that I don't watch.  You are holding a ridiculous double standard. Now I'm going to go take out my random, inexplicable anger on virtual characters in Super Smash Brothers.

      I don't know what the hell you are talking about. Quite frankly it's pissing me off more than a little bit. I loathe being outside of the loop. I also hate the fact that you cannot schedule an event without it being moved due to some previous obligation. On this note JournalCon is at 11:00 on the 31st of January. Come or don't, don't call before, just show up.  I'm probably expecting to much of you to even read this post. The webcomics are calling.  Okay...I've taken a few minutes, gotten a drink of water, had a shot of bourbon and now I'm back.  I propose a moratorium on Webcomics discussion, as well as whatever the hell DM is. Lord of the Rings dorkiness as well as things of actual substance are not banned by this bill, H.Con-175.   Vote in Comments (use Yay or Nay)  Also, Yond Nathan has a lean and hungry look;  He thinks too much, such men are dangerous.

      DMing is awesome!  But Marten, I've decided I can't do this with just two people.  I'm keeping the pirate theme, and I've expanded on it quite a bit.  I need a couple more weeks to get everything in order.  Meanwhile I've invited Paul and Tyler, and the invitation is still open to anyone else.  Especially Thomas.  Thomas, you in? Oh, By the way Thomas, you haven't posted because because time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so, and time has been moving very quickly for you, so what seemed like days to us was only about half an hour to you, which you spent eating lunch. That's my guess, anyway.  As for the Web comic talk, get in the game!  I have 11 that I check regularly.  I know from sparrows to starlings.

Anyways, I'm happy with the websites I do go to and that's why I shan't be reading your other blogs or whatever it is ya'll are asking me to read.  So yeah.  Au Revoir.

      Sorry to post excessively, but I (being the Glark to Marten's Sars) have to inform readers and bloggers of the new features.  Comments. Point, type, shoot. Simple enough, eh.  I have one other request that I'd like to express. Can we lower the amount of webcomics talk, please? I always feel left out. Of course, I could rip out The West Wing episode reviews. I'm not kidding either. Seriously.  ALSO OUT OF SHEER NECESSITY, I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN FOR REPLIES TO MY GENEROUS JOURNALCON INVITATION.

Ohhh Yeah...I'm really inclined to give you a reason.   I have one guess however because you're always online. You are playing games on the internet and never care enough to post on a collaborative blog.   Yeah I'm saber-rattling. I'm extraordinarily jet-lagged and am not in the mood to be screwed with.

Speaking of the comic, I say all you non-readers read a bit so we can play the Triangle and Robert Improvisational Puppet show! (or TRIPS)  It's like a role playing game, but made to be silly, instead of silliness being made a mere possibility.    Michael, what is IKEA?

      Jonah, the bands at the Rose Parade had to do the same thing, but for five and a half miles. And one of the bands played Barry Manilow. Ew.   Read "Happy New Year" at my site! Coming today "20 Hours in America, Part One"

      Imagine holding five pounds of dead weight at level with your head, expending your air blowing into it while at the same time having to move forward, perfectly in step with those around you on uneven ground in unbearable heat. You are allowed to lower it from head to chest level for about four beats every three minutes.  Imagine this lasts three agonizing miles, while the people you walk by are sitting, laughing, and eating food. Keep that in mind the next time you watch a parade.  It's like gladiators - deriving pleasure from the pain of others.   Other than that, Arizona was great.  2nd place by a tenth of a point in the field show, 3rd in that cursed parade.  Saw the grand canyon, met some cowboys.  Met three to six wonderful girls from Maine and got e-mail addresses and even a phone number.  Marten suggested I refer to them as Xenophiles in my title because the were strangers who like me.  Xylophones is because we have them in our pit.  I must say, the grand canyon is absolutely amazing.  If you've never been there I highly recommend it.    Webcomic recommendation of the whenever is my official new section.  I'm going to kick it off with the ever popular Sluggy Freelance.  It's got Vampires, Aliens, Ferrets, and the like, but what makes it is the characterization and the quirky humor.  The page is www.sluggy.com.  The only drawback is the 7 years of archives, but if you find yourself with the internet and lots of free time, that is how I suggest spending it.  Thomas- I think you were eaten by a carnivorous moose from another planet.  You would be dead, except that just as you were being swallowed a space-time vortex opened and you fell into another dimension, specifically one populated by super intelligent tuataras, who made you their slave.  You were rescued by MacGuyver, who was thrown in by a similar vortex, and he created a dimensional flux agitator out of a pair of dirty socks, a toothpick, and some frozen orange juice.  However, the agitator wasn't perfect, so you ended up in the right dimension but the wrong planet.  MacGuyver made a spaceship out of some rocks, the agitator parts, and a captured turkey-like creature, but there was only room for one, so he left you behind promising to send help.  You waited for ten years and then gave up on that, deciding to find your own way home.  However, at the discovery of a mostly buried statue of liberty you realized that you were on earth, just in the future.  So you spent the next fifty years looking through the ruins of earth technology for a time machine.  The best you could find was a youth machine, which is why you still look 16.  You didn't find the time machine, but MacGuyver found you.  He had realized his mistake almost instantly, but because of relativity it took 60 years of your time for him to come back.  He was able to build a time machine with all the ruins you found, so you got back, only you were in New York.  Because you had no money you had to work as a taxi driver to raise the money, but while you were driving the taxi you got pulled into a web of mystery and intrigue revolving around a series of murders and a woman named Moreen LaRue.   Eventually you solved the mystery and got the girl, but she was run over by a speeding bus, so you returned here because you wanted to forget that other life and it's woes.  (I think I deserve a cookie for that.)   I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Yeah, Eoywn rocks. Oh, hello. I didn't know anyone was here. Before you all start, the laptop died a horrible death on the fourth day of the trip, thus making me unable to update daily. I have some of my pieces in a notebook (sitting in my new Dead Tubey messenger bag) however the rest are on the laptop (probably in a warehouse somewhere)  Thomas, let me start out by saying welcome back. Also that people don't respond well to contests. Believe me. I know.  I'll be updating in a completely random order until I'm done, dammit.  Jonah: I tried desperately in vain to find the Fiesta Bowl parade, but I was in Pasadena at the time, and thats kind of like asking for Pepsi in Atlanta. Nathan: Crazy Idea! Don't try out for the play. You'll thank me on many a spring Saturday morning. Marten: IKEA! Erin: IKEA! Thomas: IKEA! Sophia: IKEA! (That rhymed. Hee.)  And...I'm spent.

      Marten says he couldn't see my last entry, so I'm posting it again.  Marten, I see you have started Monstrous Regiment. Isn't it special? It has some sort of dark parts later on, but I liked it.   Return of the King was so awesome! I finally saw it yesterday. Eowyn kicked the Witch King's ass! Ha ha! I especially enjoyed the adaptation for film of the above line. I forget exactly how it went, but I remembered that part from the book, so while I was watching, I was like, "Say it... say it..." And Frodo and Sam had some very nice love scenes. And there were oliphaunts!   Thomas, were you gone because you had to return a Ring, or possibly because you joined the army, or possibly because you fell into a parallel dimension?     I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Laugh at Soph, for she is out of a loop.  Few people at LC know, though.  I mean, conversations lead to it sometimes, but it seems weird to say to some people, hey, I have a girlfriend now!  Odd conversation starter, ya know? Props to Erin for an extremely long, extremely funny post.  It was so Random and out there, that I thought michael was writing it until i saw your name at the end.  Everybody check out the lobby! Its on the links, its my new journal site.   Hey, I have a girlfriend now!

      Erin, thanks for showing Soph what a decent-lengthed, interesting post looks like.  I think you get extra lint for that.  Thomas, you recieve the shame hat tonight.  Rules of the shame hat: It is worn until you post a post with atleast a hundred DIFFERENT words.  It would have just been until you post, but Nate and Sophia made me add the qualifiers.  There are instances wherein you can not wear the hat, such as the shower or while eating or praying or while the National Anthem is being played.  But generally, wear the hat.  If Marten reports to me that you are not wearing the hat we will devise stronger punishments. Now, match-up time!  Results of the last match:  It was cancelled on account of rain and will be rescheduled to late 2005.  New match:  A super-intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a competition to see who can take over the world first.  The only rules are no Microsoft and no Easy Cheese. Now, onto business:     I have nothing to say.  Thank you

      Yesterday was the most amazing day in the history of life in my house. I should have my own journal just so that I could write about it, but instead I'll write about it here.  It all began on Friday. Actually it began a few weeks ago when my grandmother brought over several pairs of underwear that were to big for her and thought that my mom might want them. She didn't. Fast-forward to Friday. Not having learned a single blessed thing and greatly overestimating my ass, Grandma brought over a pair of her underwear that were too small, thinking that I might want them. I don't. But my brother saw them and started teasing me about possibly keeping them. So, while he was in the shower, my mom prompted me to put them in his bed. I did so.  The next day at lunch, I asked if he had found them. Mom said yes, and he had put them on her head. He said that he'd found them at the foot of his bed. Mom told him that during the night they had been in his bed. "You slept with Grandma's underwear," she said. He immediately began to plot revenge.  That night, my mom discovered that all of her underpants were gone. Really gone. And in their place was an opera-ghost-like note declaring that there was no point in asking where they had gone, for revenge had begun so beware, etc.   Conveniently, my brother was in the shower again. He wouldn't say where the underwear had gone. While I combed the house, my mom turned on hot water in all the faucets hoping to give him a very cold shower. When she realized this would take too long, she filled a cup with ice cold water and poured it into the shower and onto the little miscreant's head. Still, he would not speak. So mom took all the towels out of the bathroom.  A moment later she realized that his pajamas were still in there, but by then he had locked the door. At first she tried to pick the lock with a bobby pin, but then we broke out the heavy machinery and removed the doorknob.   For some reason this didn't work, and by now the boy was out of the shower. Still no sign of the underwear. That was when he informed me that I hadn't even found out what revenge he had wreaked on me yet. I went into my room to discover what he had done.  The worst thing possible was that he had messed with my notebooks or folders or papers that are scattered about my room. He didn't do that. But he did do the second worst thing. He took my teddy bear. If you've ever been in my room, which none of you have, you'll know that I have several stuffed animals. But there is only one that matters. He is the definitive childhood teddy bear. And he was gone. I looked through the house again, but he was nowhere to be found.    About fifteen minutes passed. My mom couldn't get the knob back on the door until my brother unlocked it. He couldn't unlock it until the doorknob was back on. So, finally, he held his side of the knob in place while mom replaced her end and he unlocked the door. Then he went to hide behind the shower curtain because he was still naked. Bad move. And he still wouldn't reveal the location of the stolen things. Worse move. We took his pajamas.  Altogether, I would say that my brother was in the bathroom for about two hours last night. After his pajamas were gone, he refused to come out. We said we would give his pajamas back when he told us where our stuff was. He said he would tell us where our stuff was when he had his pajamas back. It was a standoff.   For me, it had stopped being so much fun when Teddy went missing. I suspect that my brother wouldn't hesitate to destroy the bear if he was upset enough. My mother gave up and we into her room to watch TV, waiting for him to streak across the hall. I sat in the hall and watched the door menacingly, preparing to shoot him when he emerged like I was Natalie Portman and he was a Yankee soldier threatening the safety of the World's Largest Baby.   After awhile I realized this was impossible because I had no rifle, so I went into his room again to search. This time I was successful. He had put my poor bear into his bass drum. He had played his damn drum set while poor Teddy was inside! I dismantled the front of the drum and rescued my teddy bear. Mom's underwear was still missing. Mom told me to leave the front of the drum dismantled.   After a few more minutes, Mom gave my brother his pajamas and told him to give her her underwear and he was grounded. When he realized she was serious, he did has he was told. It had been locked in a trunk in his closet.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the most exciting thing that has happened in my  house since I have lived there.  (Wow. Just like Sassy.)  Everybody, the Oscars are tonight, and if Renee Zellweger doesn't win, I want notes of consolation from all of you.    Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

      I had the weirdest day at the gun show.  A random redhead started talking to me, and I ended up with her address.  House address. She's an hour away, so calling would be expensive, and she doesn't have a computer.  So summing up. Random cute redhead gives marten, who has a girlfriend now for those who don't know, her address. I have to write letters now. I mean, what can I do? She's going to find me at the next event anyway, so I cant ignore her. Besides, she seemed cool, I don't want to be mean.  But Kaylee will definately be a subject of my first letter, so she doesn't get any ideas.  Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

      Props to Alex Richmond.  I did win a cough drop! It was wonderful. It tasted good and healed my raw and achy throat. It was like that thing that Galadriel gave Frodo in the Fellowship of the rings.  The Title refers to the unveiling of the new template, seen below. Isn't it hilarious! Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

      Or rather, of Marten, who won the quarter.  Michael got the cough drop and Erin, the next time I see her, will be awarded the lint.  Sophia and Nathan get imaginary cookies.  Thomas, however, has not posted and will recieve the hat of shame.  This is a paper hat that says  SHAME  on it in big black letters.  Now, Match up time. I put a lot of thought into the last match-up and decided that Stephen Sondheim, as a composer, might get distracted by the pitch and rythm of the little "bloop" noises and lose.  The pitbull, however, as a pitbull, has no opposable thumbs and isn't tall enough to reach the controls, so old Steve only has to hit the ball once.  Winner: Stephen Sondheim.  Next:  Claire Danes VS Natalie Portman in a waffle-eating contest.  Only the catch is that they are also riding on unicycles, and to win, one must eat the most waffles  and  survive the obstacle course without falling off of the unicycle.  Claire Danes is equipped with an industrial strength vacuum cleaner, and Natalie Portman has a huge autographed picture of the pope.  So, now, to business.  Michael - I am intrigued.  What does this bandwagon jumping entail?  Just that comic, or perhaps others?  Nate and Soph - Do you think those little short posts get you off the hook?  I want real posts or you'll all be wearing SHAME accessories.  (Personal Note: Must find a way to keep SHAME gear from becoming fashionable.) Marten- Today is the day I abuse an admin power.   But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      Darn you, Nathan and your inability to read prior posts! (Although I did notice you posted at 6 AM...) I have to ask all my questions again! Okay...Here Goes...  When is the blog going online? What is the name of the blog?  Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title?  Who is Joining the LN Blog?  Is Nathan going to be administrator?  Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium?  Is Marten Joining?  If Marten is joining can I join?   Answers would be appreciated!  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      Number one reason I haven't been posting lately: Eighteen hour show choir competition.  It was really fun, though.  There was breakdancing and everything.   But I have had no sleep.  I require sleep to post.  Or at least I thought I did.  But apparently not.  Anyway, since then I can't stop dancing.  Whenever I hear a song I choreograph it in my head.  I think I may be turning into Micheal Humphrey.   Marten, does Kaylee read this blog?  It's just something I'd like to know.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      When Omar G., the Smallville recapper, writes webcomics, that will be the day that I jump on the bandwagon.  Day Michael Jumped on the Bandwagon -  urlLink Today   Incidentially this is the only quote from "The West Wing" that contains the word 'monkey'. Just FYI.  Erin - One 'G' in 'Zellweger'.

      Um... not much is going on in my life. But I'm posting, for it has been commanded. I saw Cold Mountain. Renee Zellwegger kicked ass and earned all the awards she has won and/or will win on Sunday, Nicole Kidman was pretty and sad, Jude Law was sad and died, and Natalie Portman made a stirring appearance as the widowed and lonely mother of the world's largest baby. (It looked about half the size she is, probably partly 'cause she's so small.) She cried and then was almost raped and then shot a guy. Hooray. Jude Law is cute but not so much so with a beard. That's about all I have to say about that.  LC Players sucks. More on this later.  If I'm going to read The Other Side of the Corndog, or whatever it's called, somebody has to tell me exactly what it is. Either no one's ever said or I've missed it somewhere.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      Props to Jonah for  urlLink jumping up and down on my already weak argument against euchre until it folded like a cheap card table   Yes the title is kind of a blatant attempt to  urlLink pimp    urlLink out   urlLink my   urlLink site . But it's also a query for information regarding the LN blog. I've got a bit of curiosity about this and a few concerns.  What is the name of the blog? Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title? Who is Joining the LN Blog? Is Nathan going to be admin? Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium? Is Marten Joining? If Marten is joining can I join?  When you get around to it, information about this would be greatly appreciated  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      I'm betting on Steve, as rabid pittbulls suck at pong. It might win at a game of snood, however.   Michael, you are disqualified from the jonah's pocket sweepstakes because you had been posting.  That means I get all the lint, the loot, and everything else at youth group.   I must appologize for the cuelty of my parents.  If it makes you feel better, I'm at my computer unable to work on my report because of my dad's horrible guitar playing.  You try and think with this racket.  Jonah, I don't understand the new scheme.  Everyone else, post, for the Admin. commands it. So the rest of you are also Admin.s, but I am the origional. It's like vampires. I'm the Admin. King. But thats about it. I have nothing else to say. Except that I took Kaylee out to see Tech's Faculty musical! Well, technically my dad took us, as well as my sisters, but we had fun anyway. More on this later, probably in the lobby(check the new links)  There are times for breaking down, and then there are times to get Funky. This is one ofthose Funky times

      Jonah, you owe me the current contents of your pocket.  I've seen all the movies nominated for best picture at the Acadamy Awards this year! Ranked in Order from best to worst:  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Mystic River Lost in Translation Seabiscuit Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  I really don't have much to say, except I have to go see Miracle because  Jonah has a work ethic and Marten's parents are unsympathetic to my plight of having to go see a cheesy inspirational sports movie.  I'm done. Check out the new links! -&gt; But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      It's 10:06 and I have to be at school at 6:30 tomorrow morning, but for the love of the blog, I'm posting anyway!  Let this be an example to you all.  Anyway... Match up time.  The monkey was eliminated after it starved to death out of fear of eating the wrong bananas.  Patrick Moore tried to use his Xylophone skills to make the dancing Martians attack, but they were to caught up watching Lardman dance.  Meanwhile, the snake bit Patrick, the badgers out-danced Lardman and shamed him out of the cage, and the mushrooms ate the aliens.  This seemed like a shoe-in for the badger-mushroom-snake team, but the wrong bananas themselves came out of nowhere and defeated them, which goes to show you that you can't underestimate a banana (a recurring theme in my work, as  Corndog  readers can testify to.  Next match-up:  A single game of the original Pong between Steven Sondheim and a rabid pittbull.  So, in other news, I finally saw  Camp! .  If you haven't seen it yet you don't know what you're missing.  Sexual confusion, musical numbers, and big-hair are just a few reasons.  Also the randomly appearing main title which is sometimes backwards. I'm going to a speech meet tomorrow to compete in Poetry.   I swore I would never do that again, because the only poems I do are humorous, whereas the only poems that place are written by 7-year-olds with cancer about life in Auschwitz.  And if you've got a poem like that (and 90% of them do, 70% probably have the same cancer-holocaust poem) who needs talent?  Meanwhile, the three of us out to prove that it doesn't have to be depressing to be poetry get consistently creamed.  Ah well.  Btw, I'd encourage you all to head down to Michael's new site and post more comments that disagree with him about Euchre, but first - POST HERE!!! As in incentive, the next person to post will get a quarter or a cough drop or a piece of lint or something the next time I see them.  For FREE.  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals with which they treat your dashboard.  P.S. Isn't it weird that the Blogger spell check doesn't know the word Blog?

      Tomorrow is the sixth month anniversary of the first entry at Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog. I just felt that should be pointed out. Let me be the first to extend Jonah congratulations on six months of hilarity, Norwegians and cod analogies. May there be many, many more.  Jonah also has been busy elsewhere as he has taken over my old site, which has moved to a new address  urlLink here  I wish he would have come up with something less obvious than changing one word in the title, but hey, what can you do...  Incidentially, because I know that this is going to come up, I am posting at the same rate that I normally do. You are all just posting dramatically less. Just wanted to point that out so that we don't have another "You're taking over the blog!" controversy. Just for the record: Marten last posted 11 February, Erin last posted 15 February, Sophia last posted 15 February, Nathan last posted 16 February, and Jonah last posted 10 February. Basically I'm saying post more! I'm bored and lonely here!  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.

I'm going to keep the archives up here at blogspot, but I'm moving the Journal part of the site to SquareSpace, where you will get to access a special section of the website. Cool, huh? But the journal is prettier and I like it a whole lot better.  I'm just going to blog right here from Compendium for daily crap.  I'd like to remind you of this. My site is very nice, and you might enjoy it, But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  ETA: Journal is  urlLink here

So I'm taking large amounts of Schadenfreude in Nathan's unfortunate haircut. And now I'm going to go sit in the basement, play video games and wait to be hit with the massive amount of inevitable Karmic backlash coming my way.

      My haircut sucks.  The woman cut off way to much and now I have androgynous 80's hair.  I'm not in the best mood ever.  Also, I'm going back to my old title scheme with slight modification.  Songs from musicals, names of musicals, and quotes from musicals.  It will not change again. And the good news.  This is the last braces wire I'll ever wear!  April 7th they come off for good! JournalCon was fun, but you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  And compared to that....  I still prefer JournalCon.  Definately.

      Today blew. First of all it was laundry day. Secondly just as we were planning what to do today, Tim came up and started horking all over everything. So now Tim has the flu, I'm bored the hell out of my mind and I just realized I missed The Simpsons.   ETA: Then I watched Alias and was happy again. Then I was sad and depressed afterwards. Now I'm kind of happy because I had pancakes for breakfast! "Guess what Flappy! I'm not going to kill you yet!" And Tim isn't sick anymore! So we're going  downtown !   Erin - The whole Chicago, Chicago, Toronto thing isn't bothersome online. It's when Marten proceeds to...cackle it continuously that it grates on my nerves.  Marten - Please remove your crap from my house.  But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

      I only pressed post, not post and publish with that last entry, and I want to make sure it gets up, so I'm posting it again. Sorry for the inconvenience.  JournalCon was fun. Even though I only sat through two episodes of Sports Night. And wasn't really paying attention to them, but rather to the journal of Anakin Skywalker, which was, well... wizard.  And let me be the first person to annoy Michael and say...  "Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago TORONTO!"   But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

However she did get to wear a hilarious wig on LC Current so all is good.  I really don't know what I'm doing here except to trumpet "JOURNALCON!"   Edited to add: I remember what I wanted to say. I may be downstairs in the basement when y'all arrive. If I don't respond to the doorbell walk around back down the sidewalk, down the steps and into the back yard. I'll be there, and the door will be unlocked  Hopefully, Y'all check before you come!

      I've gotten confirmation from Thomas and almost confirmation from Erin. However Thomas does not lend his name to a semi-hilarious Sports Night reference, Ergo "Erin's Coming, Hide Your Heart Girl.  JournalCon. Tomorrow at Six. Michael's House. E-mail me  urlLink here   for additional information and stuff.  PS I have  Chicago . And by the way movies and stuff need to be italicized 'cause I thought Marten wanted to go to Chicago for a JournalCon, which would be...easy, now that I know the secret entrance (Stony Island Avenue!) but expensive to say the least.   However it would be cool...  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

      Huzzah! New schemes, and journalcon is finally happening.  Chicago is a must at some point. For some reason I still don't own it.  I also must show those of you who are familiar with Triangle and Robert, namely Nathan and Jonah, my new parody.  I got bored in math and started drawing polygons, and it turned into an alternate T universe.  Enter: Thomas and Rhombus.  Its not just a crappy hack of the origional, Ive got interesting ideas, it works. just read it.  Its wacky and absurd in a whole new sense of the word(s).  I don't like Phillipy.  I do like showing him up with well done assignments.  The battle continues.  History is a giant crack.   Sorry, I couldn't help myself

      At the suggestion of Michael, my new title scheme is animal group names.  When I run out, 'll make them up.  The winner of the last match-up is Mary Poppins, which is surprising insofaras she wasn't a competitor.  See, Larry ate his mount and his lance, and Helen Keller headed off in the wrong direction.  Neither of them really won, so Mary Poppins was declared the winner by default, as was laid out in the original plan. The New match-up: Who would win in a steel cage death match between Patrick Moore (with Xylophone), a badger (with mushroom and optional snake), a monkey (with the wrong bananas), and Lardman (whose life is an exciting adventure). Feel free to post comments on how the match might play out or comments to the effect of "You are a silly English Kee-Niggit!"  For Research:  urlLink www.weebls-stuff.com  and  urlLink Rather Good   Journalcon will be Bizzawesome I am sure, and I will be there with or without bells on, probably without.   Those of you who are not reading  urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog  are doing yourselves a disservice. Or atleast doing me a disservice.  Anyway, Erin atleast understands the importance of feedback for good writing, so read and post please.  History is about to crack wide open. Hold on to something.

      Okay. Here's the plan for JournalCon. Everyone arrive at 6:00. We'll eat pizza (by the way my parents won't be home for some of the time, that does not mean that drinking or other badnesses are allowed) I'm hoping to finish season one of Sports Night. That is my goal, however if you are all bored, we can do other stuff. People need to bring snacks. Erin (if she comes) and Sophia will leave by 11:00 (at my parents behest) and we'll...do stuff. The Comstocks are coming around 9:00 so we'll watch Joan of Arcadia then.  Now I know that Erin, Thomas, Sophia and Nathan are unfamiliar with Sports Night so I have compiled a quickie "previously on" segment  Previously on Sports Night: Casey and Dan were Anchors, Dana was Producer, Natalie was Executive Producer, Issac was managing editor, Jeremy was...something else, Sally was the skanky ho who ran the 2:00 update. Here's where it gets complicated...Casey loves Dana, who is in love with Gordon. Natalie is hellbent on getting Dana and Casey together, however Dana is uninterested because she doesn't think that Casey is really interested in her. Natalie liked Jeremy and they were really cute together. Natalie got sexually assualted by a football player and the crew worried about the fallout, which never came.  Now I also know that Jonah, Nathan, Sophia, and Thomas are unfamiliar with Joan of Arcadia so I have compiled another "previously on" segment here  Previously on Joan of Arcadia: The Girardi family picked up and moved to the titular town of Arcadia, Maryland. Joan talked to God, who appeared to Joan in different (and frequently hilarious) forms, befriended Adam, an artist, and Grace, the militant...I don't know how else to describe her. The dad, Will, was a police chief, the mom, Helen, was a secretary at the school. The older brother, Kevin, was a baseball player who was injured in a car accident resulting in his being in a wheelchair. The Youngest child, Luke is a geeky kid who really reminds me of the Comstocks. Adam's Mom had died. God told Joan to do random stuff, which would benefit somebody in someway (a friend, a child, a teacher etc...) One of these things was to keep one of Adam's (the Artist's) sculptures out of the school art fair, she had a 'failure of imaginiation' and ended up smashing the sculpture with a chair. This worked out badly, as Adam came in just as she did this. So Adam and Joan had a falling out. Eventually Joan and Adam made up after Helen befriended Adam and Grace Helen and Joan intervened and helped Adam read his mom's suicide note, which was pleasant and left good ripples. So Adam and Joan kissed and the world went 'SQUEE!'. Also Grace and Luke kissed at a dance then worked together on the science fair, leading to a really cool Goldbergian sequence of events that lead to the previously mentioned kissing. So they're kind of together. Kevin got a job at a newspaper which lead to him making out with his boss, Rebecca (who is Sydney Poitier's daughter). Will discovered massive corruption at the city level and squealed to the FBI which lead to the dissolution (I think that's a word) of the Police Department. So now he's a Detective and the man who provided the information is the new police chief. Whew!  Come at Six, Girls leave at Eleven, Guys leave whenever the next day.  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

      Okay, I'm starting to think that we need to get Sophia a massive Thorazine drip. I'm sorry I missed the thespian play, I was in Chicago and I got brochures out the wazoo. However, I would enjoy watching it on video. Ha! Bwah Ha Ha Ha! Even  I  didn't believe that! I really don't have anything to say except that I'm blogging from the school library where there has been no appearance of the Killjoy. Thankfully. Hey! Look! It's an actual class coming in to do actual research in the actual library. You know we have about ten computer labs why don't teachers take advantage of those? By the way, links probably won't be up for a while, because I don't care that much.   History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

      Great Job, Nathan. You might as well have just said MacBeth! Also LNTV? Is that like announcements? Because that would just be mean. Also because it bears repeating,  Start Your Own Blog.   In unrelated news, Break A Leg, Erin! And Massive Props to Marten!  In a completely unsurprising twist the italicization of the blog can be attributed to one Marten "Glutenous Polypeptide" Dollenger. See my post "I am on my way. When I am manifest, our work begins..." wasn't italicized when I posted it. But it was after Marten posted his silly post. So it's all Marten's fault.  Also Comments are down until I get back from Chicago. Sorry!

      The new title scheme is in, it is science fiction quotes.  Which means mostly Star Wars, Trek, Gate and really good Babylon 5 or Farscape or some even more obscure show.  Musical songs was getting tedious. I want admin powers.  If you give me admin powers, I will give you chocolate.  if you don't, I will kill this innocent little llama.  The choice is yours. There is now one major male part in the musical left to assign, and three guys left without parts.  The other two are both dancers who can't act (or, in Micheal's[not you!] case, sing).  Which means, most likely, Chad will get two parts.  Barring that, I probably have it, but I really wish she'd announce it soon.   I have decided not to do choir next year.  I'm probably going to take LNTV instead. Good luck tonight to Marten and Erin.  Nothing else to say. The vegetable must be destroyed!  Cast it into the garden in which it was grown!

      I don't anticipate many updates this week, so I'm just going to have to be clever and write posts so the awful italics (all M ichael 's fault, despite what he says. All his fault, people) will go away.  I am totally in love with Tony Kushner's "Angels in America". It's a play about people, all of them flawed, living in America and either dealing with AIDS and Homosexuality on a first hand level. But despite some...bizarre content (angel sex. which is a lot creepier than it may sound. Even if the angel does look like Emma Thompson) the writing is beautiful and the play is sweeping and epic. And the angel is really cool.  I'm seeing Designing Murder* on Thursday. Is it anything like Designing Women? Is it about several white southern women who have hilarious misadventures in a large house in Atlanta? Cause that would be cool.  *Yes I know, It's "Design For Murder", but for the sake of the joke...

      Erin I'd like to start out by saying 'Bitch, that giftcard's mine!' But seriously people, I am coming to see the play. Friday and Saturday, I will be at the Chicago Inter-Continental Hotel for the Chicago Auto Show. Which totally ROCKS! So anyway Jonah, Charissa and I will be there Thursday Night.  Also Bingbing Chu? Really?  And Erin I'm sorry for the first line, I said it in jest, please don't hurt me.   The vegetable must be destroyed!

      Okay, that last post was short just so that I'd win in the contest I had going with Marten over who could post that tickets were on sale first. As far as further information goes, they are 6 and 8 dollars at the LC box office. If you buy them on Tuesday you get entered in a raffle to win a hundred dollar Simon Mall gift certificate.  Design for Murder kicks ass. It has murder and intrigue and peope oozing sex and me in a wig. It's really a good play, which is why we blew everyone else out of the water at regionals yesterday.  I don't want to comment on the other plays there. That would make me sad. Except to say that the straight version of the Scarlet Pimpernel was the worst one, and one of the people in the cast wore tennis shoes. In Cheaper By the Dozen almost everyone wore no shoes. And the name of one of the chorus girls in Little Shop was Bingbing Chu. I am not making this up.    Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      Got back from Thespian regional conference last night.  To sum it up, everybody sucked but us, with the exception of Why Do We Laugh, and the dentist's pants in Little shop of Horrors. I'll leave the rest of the actual plays to Erin. I signed up for an Improv workshop, which would be more fun if almost everyone didn't suck at it. Questions only was fun, though, I wiped the floor with those would-be Inquisitors.     Michael -When did you see the books?  Did you see my  The Almost Complete Works of ?   Nate -We don't constantly talk of lc teachers. I just described him, anyway, rather than just throwing him i a post expecting you to know about him.  And I'm with Michael on the matter of recruitment, we have plenty of bloggers.  Maybe you should start a mostly LN blog.  Only you, Jonah and I even know Tyler and Paul, so you could be admin to a sort of sister blog to Compendium. An affiliate, if you will.    Everyone -Buy tickets for Design for murder! Its good! details from erin, cuz she already posted it!  The vegetable must be destroyed!

      I actually don't care one way or another.  It just seems kinda pointless.  I don't know if she'd even want to be on.  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

      Today is Ewan McGregor's birthday! Yay!  Irrelevant spoiler of the day: Palpatine is the Phantom Menace! I know, you never saw it coming. But, you see, all of the dark side stuff and the crumbling of the Republic-- he engineered all of that. It was all part of his plan! He is Darth Sidious! And since he is menacing the Republic and no one knows it's him... that makes him... the Phantom Menace! Sio Bibble was a pretty good red herring, though. Next time: Anakin is WHO?

      Wow, in all the excitement of my last post it seems that I forgot completely about the irrelevant spoiler of the day! Let me amend that now.  Who is the father of Padme's twins? Well, Threepio and Artoo were eliminated for technical reasons, although they couldn't quite understand why. To Padme's dismayed surprise, Master Yoda bowed out citing that he was a different species, although he would not disclose any further specifics. Then, after Padme had spent some time counting backwards on her fingers, Mace and the coffee guy were also eliminated. The coffee guy ran from the room in tears. Count Dooku left quietly because, let's face it, he's about eighty and he didn't want to face this kind of embarrassment. Palpatine soon followed suit. This left Anakin, Obi-Wan, Captain Typho, and George Lucas. Captain Typho was eliminated when the handmaiden Dorme jealously stepped forward and spat, "He was with ME that night." Obi-Wan and Anakin then engaged one another in a duel, while George looked on and laughed maniacally. Just when it seemed that this might go on forever, the paternity test results came back. They revealed that the father was, indeed, Anakin Skywalker. He enthusiastically embraced his wife, while over his shoulder, she and George exchanged a wink. Everything was going as planned... Next time: So, just who IS the Phantom Menace?   It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

      Except that it is.  Happy Spring Break everybody! Woohoo! I will see many of you at JournalCon 1.5: Hobbits Gone Wild. I can name it that if I want.  I got Wyrd Sisters back from Mrs. Grabill today after a long four or five-month absense! (The DaVinci Code is still out however... ) Also, Michael is reading The Light Fantastic! All in all, this is a big Discworld day for me.  I'm so excited about this spring break. Aside from doing nothing, I plan to do lots of things. But don't worry, they're things that basically amount to nothing. Like working on my senior year scrapbook and my Star Wars album (I hope to bring that on Tuesday to show off, 'cause it's pretty) and I plan to attmept my very first post on fanfiction.net. I'm going to fix up Dex's Diner and stick it up to test format. Plus I'm almost done with my Velma Kelly story. And I need to finish my Ani/Padme essay. And make some headway in "Surrender." But it's all okay, because I feel like I've got a good burst of creative energy going.  So everybody wish me luck! Yay!

      Woohoo, I'm Delivery Man!  I must only use my power for good.  This is going to be awsome, and I pity you losers who can't go.   So what is new for me?  I switched from chemistry to latin for next year.  Apparently I can't take chem unless I take algebra 2 at the same time.  I'm worried about latin, though.  It sounds like work, and I've already got a lot of that for AP.  I might still switch to etymology, but I don't know.  Latin seems interesting.

      As the title suggests, I'm pretty damned tired right now. I'm also posting here to announce details of JournalCon 1.5!  Where: My House. I'm not putting my address here. You've been there before, you know where it is. When: 12:00 on Tuesday March 30th, 2004 Why: To Snark and write a fan-fic send-up of Lord of the Rings Who: Any Blogger in Indianapolis and not Florida or the Caribbean.  Food Details: Either we can do pizza, or we can all give Marten $10 bucks and he can pick us up Panda Express. If anyone else likes that idea, IM me with your order. I recommend the Orange-Flavored Chicken. Drinks and snacks will be provided. Also: JournalCon 2: Electric Boogaloo is coming... The following is a preview of Sports Night: Season Two.  Dana: Stand there. I'm gonna sack you. Jeremy: Okay, I need just another moment of your time, then you can go back to being crazy.  Dana: My brother can beat up your brother. Natalie: My brother's a grad student in comparative literature. My mother could beat up my brother.  Dan: Honesty for Pixley!  Sam: Dana, I have been through alcohol, marriage and network television. If you want to kill me, you're gonna need some kryptonite.  Casey: I didn't do the bread. Dan: What'd you do? Casey: I did what I do, Dan, I did what I do. Dan: You screwed up your romantic life in front of fifth graders?  Casey: I could be like a blind detective, have my own TV show. Dana: You DO have your own TV show.  Isaac: Does the porn star know you're this much of a dork?  Isaac: The kid can't even walk yet. Why are we locking the medicine cabinet? Dana: Does he crawl? Isaac: Not up walls, no.  Natalie: "Jeremy, one day you'll see that my love for you isn't the product of liquor-induced mood swings and that I'm yours for the taking at your command and that the day I broke up with you is the most regrettable day of my life. " Jeremy: "Okay, but I broke up with you." Natalie: "I find you loathesome, and my hatred of you knows no bounds."  Dana: "That's right. My show is on. My show is on! My show is on! My show is ON!"  Casey: "...with revenge on their minds they welcome the Tigers to the house that Ruth built this evening." Dan: "Excuse me, Casey, but Ruth didn't build the house this evening, did he?" Casey: "No, Dan, and thank you very much for correcting my every mistake no matter how small, oh these many years." Dan: "What are friends for?" Casey: "To annoy the hell out of you?" Dan: "Exactly." Also, just a thing. Please restrict templates to one or two lines, otherwise it ends up awkward.

      Branson, MO, is without a doubt the cheesiest city in the united states, possibly the world.  This makes it absolutely perfect for a National show choir competition.  I've come to the conclusion that when a person does show choir long enough, that huge cheesy smile becomes a permanent facial feature, and they can't turn it off.  And having 16 choirs worth of show choir people in one place for 4 days only compounds the problem. In all seriousness, though, it was really fun in a cheesy sort of way.  You know what else is true about show choirs?  They tend to attract their share of, shall we say, loose women.  I talked to a girl for maybe twenty minutes on Saturday before she tried to kiss me.  When I told her I had a girlfriend, she immediately moved over to Cristian, stealing him from one of her friends.  Yeah.  Truth be told, the nicest girl I met was a lesbian.  Despite all this, or maybe in part because of it, hanging out with the Chesterton girls was really fun. I also saw some amazing show choirs.  I won't bore you with details, except to say that the 2nd place group did all music by Journey and it rocked.  Also Kevin and Donald from Moby Dick were in the fourth place choir, and Kevin tried to show up the Ben Davis flip guy, but fell short.  Literally. We ended up getting 9th out of 16, which is really not bad for us.  Hip Street got 6th and won best tech crew, and Ben Davis got 2nd.  Ming Chan suprised everyone by getting best female performer, despite not having any solos or being featured in any way. More later when I have time.  It's good to be back.   By the way, if you want to see our shows, we're doing them for the last time ever on Wednesday at 7:00.  Price is $2.00.

      Haha, John Dimmick!  I know him!  I drove to choir with him in...8th grade?  I think?  So about this board, I get to be an administrator!  Yay!  I have no idea what to do or what kind of stuff I'd be expected to do, but I can assure you that I will do this to the best of my ability.  :D  And I ALSO get to be a girl.  Wow.  I'm so honored.  And now I think I'll go shower...although you probably don't care.  Oh well.  Au Revoir, amigos...  The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

      Props to John Dimmick for a really really good idea that I totally just stole.  I'd like to start off by saying that this post is a completely new post on a completely different day and with Marten, Thomas and Nathan out of town, it may seem like I'm posting a lot and if you're offended by this...well...bite me. The juniors (in Inter-disc) at LN have created a board to discuss...stuff. School, Current Events, Homework and other things. It's a really good idea, and now, for the first time ever, I present to you  urlLink THE LC INTER-DISC/AP BOARD ! Or LCIDAPB! No actually that's a really sucky acronym. But I really, really need your help. Tell everyone who's going to be in either Inter-Disc English/US History or AP English/US History to come here and debate and chat and stuff. By the way, Marten and Thomas are my official mods. Sophia, by virtue of being a girl gets to be a girl. No wait, Sophia gets to be the other admin.  The Great Work Begins...  The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?! (</post></Blog>
