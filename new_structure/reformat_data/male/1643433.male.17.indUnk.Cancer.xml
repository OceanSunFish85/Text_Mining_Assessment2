       It seems like I like to take off my pants when its dark, regardless of if I'm around people or not.  Like I did tonight in Phillip's room with Nick, Vito, Ashley and Mandi.  I think Mandi enjoyed it a little too much.  Haha.  Um. . . Went to Jared's graduation party/house show.  It was fun.  I like making a fool out of myself.  I didn't stay too long though.  We all headed to Phil's house where my pants incident occured.  Now I'm home.  I've cemented my love for Rilo Kiley.  Ever since I bought their LP, The Execution of All Things, I've been falling to sleep every night listening to it.  Oh, so good.  Hey, I'm not stressed out, this is awesome!

       Holy hell today is boring.  My brother woke me up at 12 and told me to eat.  Did all that stuff and started cleaning.  I fucking cleaned for most of my day.  Started with my car and worked my way to my room.  I finished around 4 or so.  Everything is clean and sanitary.  Now I'm bored as hell.  I couldn't read because I'm going insane.  My mom is being such a prude.  I felt horrible earlier.  Felt like smashing things and myself.  Parents can do that to you.  Feeling so much anger still.  No one called today.  It's okay.  I have no plans for tomorrow except go to work and help my dad with his new shipment of furniture.  I'll probably go to that show alone and leave early because my psychotic tyrant of a mother wants me home by 11.  Arg.  Going insane.  Will anybody save me?  Or at least put me out of my misery?  Damn.

       Well, today was disheartening (thanks Jessica).  Woke up at 12:30 again because I couldn't fall asleep last night.  Helped my dad set up some furniture today and came back into San Jose around 4.  I recieved a phone call from Phillip on Cami's phone saying that he and the Jasons are picking up equipment then heading over for practice.  With time to kill, I bought some burritos and ate till I got sick.  Cory informed me that practice was scheduled for between 1:30 and 2.  It was getting near 5.  They came but Cory couldn't practice so stayed in front of Cory's house while Phillip and the Jasons discussed their plans for the evening and so forth.  Ellie called my cell phone but not for me, for the Jasons.  Yay.  Some more plans were made by them but I just got fed up and left.    Isn't it great that people you've grown close to over the years won't call you anymore, or even think about including you in their plans?  It's fucking incredible. Well, I'm over it.    Honorable Mention goes to Cory, Diana, and Jessica for listening to me bitch and moan.  Oh man, Tuesday was productive.  Played handball and dodgeball.  Hand and face hurts.  Maniac called and we hung out in Campbell with the rest of the kids.  Super fun.  I hope this wasn't a contradicting post.     Jackass.  That's what I am.

       Okay.  I'm going insane.  All this thinking with no action is really driving me insane.  I cannot get through to my family.  No compromises can ever be made.  All this is wrecking my mind.  I can't think.  Every little thing is aggravating the hell out of me.  Summer is absolutely horrible and depressing to even think about.  I need a pick-me-up.  I see a few solutions:  My parents actually listen.  I run away, but that won't help my home situation.  The world explodes.  I die.   I've been praying to God for death the past couple of nights.  Why am I acting like this?  I feel like I have nothing to live for.  This is all so petty.  Great. I get to spend most of my fucking day tomorrow with my family.  I want to voluntarily admit myself into a psychiatric ward.  My life is nauseating.

       I have been listening to the Postal Service for the longest time.  Um... I don't know what's going on anymore.  I have lost touch with reality.  I recently turned 17.  To celebrate, my father took the day off and took my little brother and I to the beach.  That was fun.  The following day, I got into a mess of trouble with my parents + grandma.  Not the greatest of times.  I think the more sleep I get, the more weird my dreams get.  Odd.  Drop Dead played last night at the Slaughterhouse and I couldn't go.  Why do I lead myself to believe that I might be able to go to these out of city shows?  I guess I'm a dreamer.  Comedy Central is pretty funny.  That's what's keeping me going nowadays.  I started riding a mountain bike.  It feels nice to get outside.    Days have gotten excessively boring.  I'm too lazy to search for a job.  I'm glad to see that everyone out there has a life.  It warms my little heart.    Rollin' Rollin' Rollin' with the punches.

       This makes me feel... sad?  Napoleon Dynamite tonight, bitches.   You have a goodbye kiss- much passion and longing, but never lasting.      urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       In light of events of the past few weeks, I have been keeping a steady ship.  Even though everything has definitely gone to shit, I have time and time again, wiped the shit stains.  Even though this is, without a doubt, the worst summer I've had so far, I'm still going strong (sort of).  If I were to die in the next two minutes, I wouldn't mind it because that's how low I've gotten.  I don't really care what you think of that because your opinion is null and void.  I really have nothing to live for.  And I'm not even in a depressed mood right now.  I'm actually kind of cheerful.  Doesn't mean life is peachy, though.  Feel like running away.  Again.  Yes, all talk and no walk.  Oh well.  Phew, I passed one of the  five  AP tests that I took.  And I thought I did bad...  Honorable Mention goes to the kids in Campbell and Maniac, for making me laugh and have a good time whenever I'm around them, even though I have to leave early every single time (thanks mom).  I want a cigarette and a 40oz.  Okay maybe not.  Just not hardcore enough.

       Another week gone. That's one week closer to school. So, I still don't have a job but I'm hoping to land one by school. I want to work during school. Suicide? I THINK SO! Piled on to are college apps. Jessica was talking about writing her essays for those things and I got all bent out of shape. I don't even know what I want to major in, let alone where to go. There has been some hardcore school searching.   [Side Note: I'm busting out the Mirah/Modest Mouse playlist. School is definitely around the corner. . .]  Many-a-good shows have passed this weekend. Bruce Banner from freakin' Sweden came along with a bunch of Japanese bands played at Gilman and to my complete and utter surpise, I couldn't go. Hostile Takeover played at the place in Santa Cruz tonight along with Look Back and Laugh, etc. . . and I again, couldn't attend because of other obligations such as church.   Went to work with my dad on Friday. Delivered some furniture to this dude that lives in the mountains in some city past castro valley. Getting lost with my dad on a two lane road (sometimes one lane), going uphill in a full size truck. Not fun. Got all the crap into the guy's house and went back to the store. I read a few chapters from Warriors Don't Cry by Melba Pattillo Beals. It's pretty good and quick. About the integration of schools in the south. Brutal.   Once again back to the school deal. Senior year is gonna start soon. We're talking our photos this wednesday. I gotta finish reading the summer reading books and start some more Chuck, or maybe finish all the books I started already. I've got to start requesting application forms from about every college imaginable. Do some serious thinking (what my strong points and skills are, what I like to do, etc. . .) Growing up really scares me. It really does.   Just wanted you all to get a decent post for once. Not much bitching, not much bragging. Keeping ties fresh.

       something of extraordinary proportions happened!  last night's show made up for the whole week/weekend. I was looking forward to that show since school ended. Turn out wasn't as big as I had imagined. Hecka bands from out of town but i guess thatSaves the Day show stole all the kids.Maniac called half an hour before i wanted to leavesayingHostile Takeoverdoesn't haveenough space to take all their equipment and if i coulddrive an amp up there forthem. I wasbored so I complied. Eric already drove some kids to go soFrench, Jack and Richardwere the only ones at the compton house.Picked up the amp andRich tagged along in my car becauseFrench's car was full. French andJack waited for Trouble and we went to pick up the Jasons. Jason B. decided notto go atvisitin Steven's, so it was only Jason H. but wesomehow picked up Matt Townsend on the way.  It was my first time driving to Santa Cruz and it was with a car full of people. Just took it nice and slow and we got there in about half an hour. It wasn't as bad as I thought, just had to pay attention. Hung out in the parking lot of the venue and played frisbee. Met a lot of new people and met up with everybody else. First band wasn't that great, but not bad either. Hostile Takeover played second and it was a good set. Nobody was moving in the crowd, but they were good. The third band was Threatener and was part of the reason why I wanted to go. Hailing from MI, they played a ripping set. Precision blast beats and double bass drum but using only one pedal! FAST. However their live set sounds like one big long song. I couldn't really tell the difference. Ate some taco bell during Mother Speed's set. The 1/2 bean burrito destroys.   HIT ME BACK played next. They were practically the other part of the reason whyI went. From LA, they just play goodfuckin' thrash that people can danceto.And peoplewere hecka just dancing/moshing. It was awesome. Brown-suede/tweed-jacket-corduroy-shorts guy was awesome! Along with the girl in the long skirt and bag. Dancing their heartsout. I had a lot offun during their set. Street Trash was up and they were awesome. really good.Some funny antics with masks andvhs pornoboxes. Bones Brigade fromMaine played and they sounded really metal-y. It was fun watching them and all the punksget riled up.  I've been saving up money fora week and walked away with acouple of records and shirts.The night was fun. I got homearound 12 andthe drive back wasn't bad either.Good times. NowI want to go the see Bruce Banner this weekend at Gilman and anothersimilar show at the same venue (415 Front Street). Good night, kids. Andtake care of each other.

       (As a new feature, I will make the song I'm listening to at the moment accessible to you.  Just click the title or the whole right-click, Save As.)  Many weeks have passed since the last time I posted.  Not much has happened though.  I just went to work a lot and a big highlight was Phil's birthday party.  I don't remember much of what has happened.  My brother's birthday passed, I made him a cake.  Took my senior portraits.  Worked some more.  It wasn't up until recently that I started keeping in touch with friends from school.  Hung out with Ellie one day and it was fun.  She was a sight for sore eyes.  Saw the Village, um... I thought it was a disappointment.   I haven't been out of the house much.  I haven't been to any shows, but there is the Jigsore Grindfest tomorrow that I want to go to.  I'm on the last book for summer reading and it is a bore.   So Phil's party.  Good times that ended too soon for me.  It was a surpise party and I'm sure he was surprised.  Picked up Andrew V. and headed to Phil's.  There were a bunch of people there already.  Mostly from school and it was nice to see them again.  I have found out from this party that I'm not a very entertaining guy.  I don't really have much to say, I'm not very funny, I'm just not amusing, but everybody else was and it was nice.  I had to cut out early because I had to wake up early the next day to help with some deliveries.  Didn't get to meet Ellie like we had planned.  She showed up fashionably late.   So, I couldn't sleep.  Stayed up most of the night and had small talk with people online.  A good day I thought.  Earlier this week I sent in an order to Ebullition for the Scholastic Deth discography and Limp Wrist discography.  Check those two bands out if you haven't yet.  I'm still waiting for them.   I'm addicted to online mini-golf.   urlLink www.jippii.com   Yeah.  I'm attracted to it.   Went up to SF today to help my sister move in.  She lives in a really nice neighborhood.  It's not an on-campus place so she can do whatever she wants, such as letting me crash at night, i.e. shows.  There's gonna be a house-warming party or something.  I want to go.    I swear, Phillip, I'll start updating this more often now that I know you read it.  And I wholeheartedly agree.  Girls are another species.  Things get so complicated.  I sometimes wish I didn't have any feelings.  But hey, things will get better eventually.  Overdue Post: Priceless.
