      There was once a man who lived in a town, a town on the beach, and a beach on the Caribbean Sea. This man was the town pickler. He pickled everything imaginable and was renowned in the town. Onions, tomatoes, meats, fish, carrots, coconuts, and anything else he could find. His pickling business's, Pickler Peat's Pickled Pastries, was making money faster than a rigged slot machine. Unfortunately, however, a total accidental occurrence happened and the mayor got sick after eating a pickled pastry and the pickler went out of favor and out of business's. This was a ruff time. He had to live off of his left over pickled items until he finally ran out and was thinking on just giving up and taking up a new trade when he met a funny looking man with a peg arm and a glass ear by the name of Backwards Bob. Backwards Bob took Peat to his ship and said that he could make a fortune and start a new pickling business's if he only joined up as a Pirate for a short time. Peet, extreemly happy at the idea of getting his pickling business's back said yes. They traveled many miles and endured the usual hardships of piracy, the police, other pirates, sea storms, flying monkeys, giant monsters, but these stories have been told before. One day, they came to an island and found another buried treasure, but this was different. It wasn't gold, silver, or jewels. It came in the form of 294 fresh cucumbers. Peet didn't know what to say until he keeled over and had a vision of pickled cucumbers selling by the million all over the world. When he got back up he knew it was crazy but he grabbed them all and sailed back to his pickling lab where he experimented for many days. Finally he came out and put on the shelf all the cucumbers nicely pickled. They sold so fast that he had to make more and more and more constantly. Eventually he need more employees. Because of there popularity he dropped the cucumber and left only the pickle part. His innovation saved his pickling career and everyone was happy. 
 
This came strait off the top of my head one day when someone from Canada asked me to tell a story of pickles, pirates and innovation. Enjoy.

      In Shakespeare works, there is one constant theme that never ends. It is a cruel and despicable theme, one that should be looked into with greater detail, in fact, maybe I'll get a PhD in English literature and do a theses on the subject. This subject is that of bastard sons. There is no one type of character that has ever received a worse wrap in all of literature. The question here is, "Is it really their fault?" I mean, firstly, it is in no way there fault that their parents decided to have a bit of fun and knocked accouter up now is it? Secondly, how long could you stand being called (Your name) the bastard, all the time. Its X the bastard that and X the bastard that. Come on, I would be a bit bitter and try to destroy everyone's happiness too. Think on that, there are many life lessons hidden behind this one.

      This is old news, but it still makes me as angry as a hornet who just got a stick poked at it.  Our vice-president, someone who is looked up to by so very many people, was speaking on the senate floor somewhere around a month ago.  A democratic senator disagreed with what our perfect vice-president said, so he decided to get angry.  His words, though I don't remember exactly, were something along the lines of "fuck off" or something similar.  I believe that this is absolutely awful and he should be fined or kicked out or something like that.  Swearing on the senate floor is HIGHLY discouraged by tradition, and, though not a traditionalist usually, I think that it is absolutely right.  The part of this charming story that really gets me, however, was Cheney's response to the criticism that, "he got angry" so it was alright.  Next time I get angry at a teacher who doesn't give me a good grade, maybe I'll just swear at them and see if I get away with it.

      I'm nervous as hell about putting anything I write anywhere anyone can see, but maybe nobody will see this and if they do its all good.

	 A desire for it to end and disappear forever is just as strong as the desire for it to grow and continue forever.  Whatever it is that controls how these feelings are affecting every part of the body has a sick and twisted mentality behind it because it is causing an impossible situation where not everybody can be happy.  It is human nature to make sure that they survive themselves over all others, and that they are happy rather then someone else if both cannot be.  It is sick that something, whether biological or supernatural does this to anybody.  The ultimate catch 22, the love you desire of one person faced of against the love you desire from another.  Whether the love is that of true friendship or of the heart, it does not matter a bit, it is awful and makes the chooser feel like his body, heart, soul, and every other part is being rended without thought to making it painless.  How could there possibly be a supernatural being out there that wants to preserve the human race that could do this to so many of them?  People wonder why others doubt his existence.  It is because heartbreak, torture, killing, lying, and countless horrible things are inflicted by one set of humans to others in the name of this super power.  I do not want a miracle, I donÃÂt want money or power or infinite life; I only want a chance at what everybody has the right to, love, without complication and sick and twisted monkeys thrown into its wrench.  I have not seen it yet and it seems I must wait at least one more love to see this, and until then everybody can forget the thoughts of turning me into a saint because it is not worth it and does not help me nor anybody else. 

Now wasn't that nice and bitter and depressingg.  Tell me what you think if you feel like it.
