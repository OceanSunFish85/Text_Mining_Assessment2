      Sometimes political satire is just stupid. "Satire" is a pretty holy word to the left. Liberals tend to be the first to defend Americans' right to produce, disseminate, and be vaguely annoyed by the incisive wit of gifted satirists from all points along the political spectrum. Not surprisingly, the best political satire usually comes from liberals  urlLink (Mo Rocca  notwithstanding).  The very idea of conservative satire is somewhat perplexing, and itâs usually no better in execution. Actually, itâs worse in execution, because the finished product is both perplexing  and  bad. In any case, sometimes conservatives do loosen their sweaty neckties enough to deliver some of their own cutting partisan humor, but often itâs not pretty.  I donât know about you, but the first person I think of when I see the words ânot prettyâ is Ann Coulter. And when Ann Coulter recently loosened her proverbial necktie for a ride on the Humor Express, it must have gotten caught in the wheels or something, because the result was a  urlLink horrible trainwreck .  But as I have recently learned, the most dangerous form of political satire comes neither from snide, left-wing, hipster comedians who werenât funny enough to keep their jobs on the  Daily Show , nor from shrill, catty right-wing bitches who use confusing non sequiturs as if they were punchlines. No, the most dangerous political satire is that which pretends to be apoliticalâ¦.  Yesterday at work we all gathered around a coworkerâs computer to watch  urlLink this hilarious Flash animation . âDonât worry,â he assured us, âitâs political but itâs not partisan. They make fun of both guys.â  âWell, good,â I thought. As a former Nader supporter and legal minor, I totally understand not participating in any meaningful way in the political process. In fact, my colleagueâs disclaimer actually made me somewhat excited about the clip that was loading. I was expecting the sort of fiery rejection of the Republicrat establishment that was cool to me when I was in middle school and didnât have a car. (Like that âTestifyâ music video. I once downloaded a 50-odd megabyte copy of that masterpiece on  dial-up .) As soon as the computer finished communicating with the JibJab.com servers to download a temporary local copy of this particular combination of graphics, audio, and motion data to be interpreted and displayed according to the rules of Macromediaâs patented Flash media standard, I was ready to rage against the machine.  When the status bar reached capacity, a hush fell over the assembled audience. The opening screen promised âA Parody of Woody Guthrieâs âThis Land,ââ and featured smiling caricatures of George W. Bush and John Kerry. I assumed they were going to use Guthrieâs 1940 populist anthem to reframe the current political debate not in terms of Democrat vs. Republican, but rather as a struggle between the interests of well-connected establishment politicians and the interests of the average underrepresented, disenfranchised, outsider American. What I actually saw shocked and dismayed me. Which is strange, because âparodyâ is a pretty jolly word. A word that doesnât usually suggest âdreadful, aching dismay.â  âThis Landâ is a cartoon which features vaguely unsettling static pictures of President Bush and Senator Kerry perched upon suited, dancing cartoon bodies. And, of course, animated ventriloquistâs dummyâs mouths. I mean, without them, the illusion wouldnât be complete. The statesmen dance a merry jig while exchanging blows verse-for-verse in a version Guthrieâs âThis Land Is Your Landâ modified with hilarious lyrics. (I have decided to spare my readership the hilarity of these lyrics in precise form, in the merciful spirit of  USA Today âs editorial board.)  So thatâs all well and good, right? Simple, but funny (in theory). More of a rote caricature of the current political debate than an insightful critique from a fresh perspective, but their hearts are in the right place. Itâs almost Menckenesque, except that Mencken didnât pander to the easily amused.  âThis Landâ would be harmless if it were a simple exaggeration of the way in which political candidates attack each other while each claiming to have a mandate from the American people. It would be obvious and stupid, of course. But it would be harmless because it would carry no partisan message, and would be targeted squarely at those who are already unlikely to vote because theyâre too busy laughing at it all to participate.  Butâand this is where the âdreadful, aching dismayâ part comes inâitâs not harmless. Itâs not neutral and anti-partisan. This online joke carries an implicit message to all the jaded, misinformed, blue-collar everymen who are watching it because their brothers-in-law forwarded it to them: âYou really are above this whole game. Youâre one of the few Americans smart enough not to buy into these slick politicians and their lies. But, just so you know, FYI, as a side note, for a bit of background, if you were to get involved or anything,  George Bush is just like you! â  In the clip, Bush and Kerry attack each other in turns, trading critical couplets culled from current conventional wisdom. (Conservatives, as Al Franken reminds us, donât own alliteration.) The problem is twofold; (1) Bush is allowed to make several substantive attacks on Kerry while Kerry is only allowed to repeat the same joke over and over, and (2) Bush is misleadingly portrayed as a humble representative of the hard-working American proletariat.  Problem #1: Bush describes himself as a âTexas Tigerâ and a âGreat Crusader,â while calling Kerry a âliberal weiner.â Kerry is side-splittingly dressed up in a hot dog costume, guys. Thatâs the level of humor weâre dealing with. When it comes time for Kerry to defend himself, what does he say? âIâm an intellectual.â Oh, yeah. That plays  great  in the heartland. Thanks for the equal time, bipartisan satirists! When Bush sings âYouâve got more waffles / than a house of pancakes / You offer flip-flops / I offer tax breaks,â it is a particularly insidious form of political advertising. The film includes an official Republican talking point, complete with the âflip-flopâ catchphrase, whereas the most specific attack the Kerry character is allowed to make is that Bush âcanât say ânuclear.ââ I havenât seen that in the Democratic daily message briefings, but then again I donât really have access. Iâm just a blogger. And Iâm not even one of those cool, credentialed bloggers that they let into the convention. Because I have two posts.  Problem #2: âThis land is my land,â sings the Kerry impersonator as a gleaming wedding cake of a mansion situated on a golf course of a lawn flashes on the screen. âThis land is your land,â he continues. The visual is a rustic trailer park full of vintage Airstream trailers prominently displaying the American flag. Perhaps they could have shown the luxurious Bush family compound in New England, or the mahogany-paneled executive offices Bush occupied during his oil days, or the ownerâs box at Bushâs Rangersâ stadium. Or maybe they could have just used the headquarters of Yaleâs Skull and Bones Society for both and shaved a few kilobytes off their 3.7-megabyte Flash file. No, no. Kerryâs land is the Princessâs castle from Mario, but with better landscaping (no mushrooms!), and Bushâs land is the honest, humble, blue-collar Bible belt. Flash animations donât lie, guys. They arenât beholden to liberal interests like the mainstream media.  I hope you see the problem here. If you did see the problem for a second, but now you canât see anything at all, itâs because the problem is  blindingly obvious . Someone is hiding Republican messages in the form of supposedly jaded, apolitical parodies and targeting them at the jaded and apolitical. As this sinister virus spreads slowly across the country from Gateway to Gateway, Dell to Dell, countless stupid non-participants are being subtly brainwashed with Republican lies, and thereâs nothing that liberals or respectable comedians can do about it.  As the animation drew to a close yesterday, my coworkers erupted in genuine laughter and supportive murmurs of âGood!â and âRight on!â But all I could think was, in the words of Ann Coulterâs editor at  USA Today :   NOT FUNNY, I DON'T GET IT.

      I don't know how much you've heard about this Barack Obama. I hadn't heard much of him either until I saw him yesterday on Meet the Press, which was broadcasting live from the Fleet Center in Boston. "Hey," I wondered, "what's that guy from the Matrix sequels doing on Tim Russert? You know, the stormy, resolute guy who pretended not to be going out with Jada Pinkett?" But then I thought to myself, "That's nuts. Tim Russert doesn't have actors on his show. This isn't Charlie Rose. His questions are too relevant and well-researched." So then I put on my logical deduction hat and started summing twos. It's not hard to draw conclusions about a strapping young negro gentleman in a basketball stadium, is it? Was this a confused Celtic, unaware that his home stadium had been recommissioned for promotional use by the party of his people? And also labor? (Arguably?)    No, unmuting revealed that the guest was the aforementioned Barack Obama, 42-year old Senate hopeful from Illinois and keynote speaker of this week's Democratic National Convention in Boston. Barack Obama is young, well-spoken, and black. More importantly for the Democrats, "Barack Obama" sounds like the name of an intrepid Rebel commander from Star Wars. And, as William Bowers once mused, "Which side was governed by wrinkly hypocritical white men who practiced a bastardized form of a religion and who loved uniforms and marching? Which side policed the world with huge cruisers and weapons that could destroy whole civilizations? Which side was an oppressive monoculture? ...Which side teamed with rogue mercenaries and chubby businessmen to achieve its ends? Which side suffered huge losses when two genital-reminiscent headquarters of its activity were destroyed?" Bowers has a point, but I'm not sure what it is or how it supports mine.    While I'm on the subject of Star Wars, last night I rediscovered Gustav Holst's "Mars, The Bringer of War." Man alive, what a tune. Me and my friend Rick, who played the baritone in middle school band, used to play it real loud all the time before the band instructor would walk in. I would do the "Waaaaah,  wah   waaaaaah " part on the trumpet and he would cover the " Bum  ba-ba-ba- bum bum " part. It was awesome at the time, but neither of us had girlfriends until well into high school. Actually, to the best of my knowledge, Rick still hasn't had a girlfriend. Make what you will of that, but I'm not going to be the first to pin the blame on Holst. Not most of the blame, at least; that would be wrong. Anyway, since between the last time I had heard it and last night file sharing had been invented, I decided to branch out and look up some of Holst's other compositions from the "Planets" suite, and boy am I disappointed. I expected "Jupiter" to bring the timpani if you know what I mean, and sound basically like a fat man running or falling or something like that. Instead I got "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity." What is that? I mean, what is that? And you know what? It doesn't even sound jovial! It just sounds like outtakes from the recording of the "Titanic" soundtrack, recorded during the session in which they couldn't get the synthesizer voices to work. And "Mercury, The Winged Messenger?" That just sounded like the soundtrack to a couple of Jedi going on some kind of goofy side-adventure when really they'd rather just be getting off the damn planet and getting along with their mission.    Kind of like Barack Obama, his keynote speech at the DNC, and his ongoing Senate campaign in Illinois. If you're not too strict with the logic of your metaphors. In any case, don't fall into the trap of thinking that Commander Obama's name is the only important thing about him. Because, as his colleague Admiral Ackbar would say, "It's a trap."    As it so happens, vibrant, youthful, brilliant Barack Obama is also the Democrats' best chance at capturing a Senate seat in this year's elections. Obama, who has been running a highly competitive campaign ever since his landslide victory in the Illinois primaries, found himself on the right side of an orgy (as if there were a wrong side!) when his competitor, Republican Jack Ryan, was forced to drop out of the race in shame. In shame.    As was revealed in court documents unsealed late last month, Ryan's ex-wife Jeri (Seven of Nine from TV's "Boston Public") had complained when filing for divorce that her eminent husband often coerced her into attending "sex clubs" and tried to convince her to participate in acts of public and group sex. When Jeri Ryan's allegations became public, Jack Ryan withdrew from contention for retiring Republican senator Peter Fitzgerald's seat and  urlLink ended his campaign .    With his opponent from the Party of Family Values out of the way, Harvard-educated civil rights lawyer Barack Obama was suddenly free to pursue his liberal agenda of terrorist sex and gay abortions virtually free of opposition. This rising star and his sure-shot campaign attracted the attention of the Democratic National Committee during their search for a convention keynote speaker. To many, Barack Obama was a natural choice. (Jeri Ryan was not available.) Now, on the eve of the biggest speech of his political career, Barack Obama has emerged as one of the most powerful players in one of the nation's least powerful parties.    Democrats and the  urlLink liberal media  are quick to point out that Obama's rise to success could be a significant turning point not only in the future of the Democratic party, but also in the grand scheme of the American democracy. (And I do mean "grand scheme" in every sense of the phrase.)    If Barack Obama wins his race this November, the midwestern mulatto will be the only African American in the Senate. This shocking fact brings with it many tough questions about the nature of racial advancement in the U.S. government. Why has it taken so long for African Americans to make headway in the Senate? Why don't African American voters organize to combat this problem in districts in which they hold a statistical advantage? Why is the racial composition of the nation's most powerful deliberative body so wildly out of proportion in comparison to any racial breakdown of the American populace? I mean, it's not as if there's a "No Coloreds" sign on the door of the Senate! (The sign actually reads "No blacks.")    In the end, whether the Force is or is not with young Barack Obama in Boston this week not my place to say. But I do know one thing for sure: I should totally call up Rick.
