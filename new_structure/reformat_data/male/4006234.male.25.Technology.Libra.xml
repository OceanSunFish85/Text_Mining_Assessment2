What an excellent way to spend a hot Saturday afternoon.   Based on the traffic, I wasnât the only one who wanted to get out of the city. I left at around 3:30 â 4:00 pm, headed out to Bragg Creek, and on to Elbow Falls. It took me about 45 minutes to get out there because of the traffic.   After an hour of lazing around at the falls, I got back on my bike and headed back to Bragg Creek. On the way back to Bragg Creek, I stopped off at "Elbow River Launch Point" and took some more photos (mostly of my bike ;-) ). 30 minutes later I was back on the road.   After the Launch Point, I headed on to Bragg Creek. Stopped there and filled up with gas. Busy Gas Station!I had a thought after I was back on the road; if there wasnât a gas station there I would have been in trouble! I would have been lucky to make it back to Calgary on fumes. Wellâ¦ Actually, I would have had my reserve.   Since I wasnât in a hurry to get home I stopped again for another photo.   "Hey.... Cochrane is only 22k away?!?!"   Sweetâ¦ Iâm heading off to Cochrane. 22km later I was pulling into Cochrane. While traveling through Cochrane I was tempted to stop for Ice Cream (great little  urlLink ice cream spot  there), but it was getting to be around 6ish and I didnât know what time they were open till, so I kept going. 30km later I was back in Calgary.   I did learn a couple of things on this trip:   1) I need a bigger bike if I want to do longer road trips.  2) The âbiker waveâ is a standard greeting on the highway wishing you safe travel.  3) 3Â½ hours of travel, on a motorcycle, will make you SORE! I could barely move Sunday!  4) Take a lot of fluids along. I drank 2 liters of Gatorade on the trip.   Now I will have to say, that was a fun trip!    urlLink

       urlLink     Calgary Thunderstorms (Pic 1/2) (July 13/2004)   Took the photo as soon as I saw the storm rolling in.  The sun behind the clouds made the image dark.... Different!   Yah.. This is from my balcony facing west.

       I said that I would never make a blog. But, here I am typing an introduction to this site.  I decided to start up a blog for a couple of reasons.     I don't have a good place to keep track of links that I find that would be interesting to read.   Good articles that I find, need a place where I can refer back to them later.   Just a place to ramble on if I feel like it. (Hmm.. I think I'm using this point right now)  A little spot on the web that I can call my own. Now that firekhard.org is no longer around. I might as well startup my own little place.  Maybe I'm also looking for a spot for friends to come and comment. Publish stories, links, etc.  ** Maybe I'll figure out a 6th reason later **    Posts should be informative, usable and ermm.. use the  urlLink FYOS  rule. I'll let some stuff slide ;)
