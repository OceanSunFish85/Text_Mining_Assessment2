        This fine morning, I woke up on time (6.00 a.m sharp no blunt), and found that the toilet is occupied~!! No~~!! Late again =(     Then went into the toilet at arnd 6.05 and washed up.    6.10 was out of the toilet.    Tried to wear contacts but eyes were red~!! No~~ =(    Went to style my hair, apparently it sux. However, got out of house at 6.25am.    Went to the bus stop and bus was there~!! ^-^v cool...Caught the early bus and 985 was juz behind my 188 when I alight... So heng.. :D    Got to school early, bought and ate breakfast..haha and by this time, my eyes were alright le.. so I put on my contacts.. =P cooL~!! :D            During morning assembly, gave my CT Ms Tan a letter from my parents stating that they don't wish me to go the Palau Tekong on wednesday (tml). Feeling scared at first la, but still gave her the letter la...she read and say she will ring up my dad. Haha.. I wasn't scared at all, cuz i bhaka with my dad last nite le.. :P so its double security for me if she ring up my dad..=D (clever rightz? XD)     Haha...then went to the stupid physics tutorial which is soo sooo sooo soo sooo soo sooooooooooo fast that its even faster than the lectures.. =S and that Tan Ing Keat (TIK) expect us to understand and know everything, knowing our standards of physics.. Grr... damn dulan la... he rush so fast for wad? no use de.... we dun understand ma... so i decided to slack thru the lesson......... by.......... stoning =X Well, the moon muz be blue la, got released 3 mins earlier for our break =D    Haha break le... =P wait for yy in my home class then went break together. Haha... although the break is a short one la... but its also a veri energizing one.. =P    Back in class, its GP lessons, actually its soooooo boring but i dunno y, somehow, somewhere, i get the energy that i was so spontaneous during his lessons..=P After GP its econs....normally i will sleep during her lesson but since i gave her a letter saying that im working hard for my promos (my excuse for not going tekong =X), I was snatching to answer all the questions she asked and she was kind of shocked.=P Actually, i so spontaneous is to win her favour and also to hope her to give me the "good news" that i dun have to go tekong la.. =D but in the end, she dint say anything.    Lectures~ ahh....so many things to copy... the maths make me blur blur le la~~ =( cham le... promos in ...5 weeks? :( haiz.. i hope some miracle happens or i suddenly become veri smart and know my stuff..=P    Haha lunch~ yumyum... =P~ ren le hao jiu le... finally can fill my empty stomach..=D haha...ate my delicious lunch and rush up to class for more................................maths.. -_-". The lesson was so boring that i slept for 10 mins~!! =X but anyway, she dint care abt me la.. cuz im supposingly a "guai" student who does his works and completes his assignments =P    Ok, this is a lesson i dread most............................PW... =(    Apprantly, my ST for PW is Ms Tan, and she indeed, brought me a piece of good news~!! =P=P    "Leefung, ur excused from the Tekong trip" WOOOOOOHOOOOOOO~~~~~~~~~~ me wait for this sentence dunno wait for how long le.. =P=P haha i was so happy but my friends were soooooooooo green that they beat me up =X haha actually they were juz playing la.. haha funny ppl..=)    Haha, proceed on the blardy PW, which we have to hand up draft 3 by this friday, and yet people are still at draft 2....... I help my group members to write guidelines for their chapters... and that took like 1 hr 30 mins?!!??!!? -_-" **sweat** but anyway, its over le.. i also hope my team can do well in the written report ma.. =D    Haha... PW marks the ends of my school day and then I happily go home with yy.. =P     So......Nice or bad day? =) I would say..............................Nice~!! =D    Thx dear~!! =D=D you made my day~!! =P=P    **Jia you la~ leefung.. only got 58 days for present and 5 weeks to promos~!!
