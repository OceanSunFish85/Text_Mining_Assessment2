      Well How remarkable, 24 hours to save the NHS. Well that's nice to know when the labour Party shut down the Specialist Baby unit at Fairfield, the unit that deals with people from all over Bury and the Rossendale Area. With this closure theLadies experiencing problems during pregnancy Will Have a 40 minute journey to South Manchester to reach the nearest Specialist Baby Unit.Whilst the Brave councilors on the Health scrutiny committee are gagged only the local Tories have spoke out and Labour have the cheek to say only they care about the NHS. Well say that when the first baby needlessly dies.

      So the Labour councilors in Manchester want the transport secretary's blood , is this just a ploy tocover their own incompetance? I only ask because GMPTE(Greater Manchester Public Transport Executive) was asked to findÂ£300m themselves from the public sector, so what did this labour dominatedexec do.Instead of attracting public donations and corprate sponsorship something easy to do in such a vibrant city.They sit on their own arse and sponsor, The cow parade,Plastic cows fixed all over manchester (side of buildings, yes I said side of roofs, roads androofs etc) and they wonder why there ownparty in westminster lost confidence in them, every one knows public Transport in Manchester is getting worse, Labour in Greater Manchester have no one to blame but themselves.

      Is it right that our government can cut are armed forces down when their over seas active duty increases, Maybe as an ex naval officer I am biased. But surely when the armed forces are so heavily committed than we should surely be shying away from the Stanley Baldwin approach to defense. At least he had the excuse of serving in a Bloody conflict and trying all he can to save the youth from marching to war again, but what of our ex CND waving Prime Minister now no such excuse. When we give the impression of weakness that is when our enemies will strike. Also we must ask will our troops stay. Troops just home in blightyfor less than six months are being shipped out again. Surely If a government doesn't want a large military force than it should change it's foreign policy. It should also remember when it's left wing party members and lib dem's complain about us being murders it is us murders who risk there live ending murderous Socialistregimes such as in Kosavo and Iraq
