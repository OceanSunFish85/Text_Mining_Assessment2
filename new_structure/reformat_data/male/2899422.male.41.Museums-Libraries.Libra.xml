         WILLSON Call me Willson. Iâm just this bloke but I suppose Iâm in charge. Iâm the one who was always there. Iâm the one who doesnât act like nothing happened.  Here I am, still, trying to write the unrightable wrong, to right the unwriteable wrong. Here I am, trying to move beyond the father-tongue and the mother-tongue, beyond the imagined voice that judges harshly, and the voice that canât even try to explain.    	In front of me is a box of index cards covered in names, numbers and tiny scratchy annotations. Behind me are shelves full of other peopleâs books. Iâve read first novels by the dozen. Even the ones that come close donât come close enough. Half of them you could sum up in a sentence; Iâm a very special person, allow me to explain. Some people write about the start they had as if aspects of that life arenât good enough for them. But what if aspects of that life arenât good enough for anyone? And what if you donât just want to write about the brainy ones, the horny ones, the funny ones? What if you donât want to translate everything into the language of escape?  	Apparently Iâm supposed to set the scene; create a sense of place. So; Portland then, is shaped like some obscure cut of offal. Itâs tethered off the Dorset coast just next to the town of Weymouth, where the plague first entered Britain and where Charles III was immersed in the sea as a cure for madness. The islanders refer to the island as the island and the rest of the world as outside. But Portlandâs only an almost island, a cross between a peninsula and a cul-de-sac, you get to the end and thereâs nowhere to go but back. Iâm looking at a map of Portland now. Itâs on the wall next to a cartoon where a manâs saying âRemember, being an artist is largely a matter of total commitment to an activity which everyone else thinks is a complete waste of time.â   	In that first edition of Milk, Milk, Lemonade, Ed wrote that until the Eighteenth Century there was no word in the English language for the concept of boredom. Then, he claimed, some explorers discovered Portland, and everyone agreed such a word was needed. The largest village on the island is Fortuneswell, a grid of narrow terraced boxes, so packed together that itâs impossible to escape the feeling of being overlooked. These boxes are built from the famous local limestone. This stone, the colour of dry dog-shit, is a source of great pride to the islanders. They boast of the fact that St Paulâs Cathedral and other fine buildings are made from it. They miss the point. Itâs the architecture that counts, making the out of the ordinary out of the ordinary, the thing chosen out of the thing given. 	This place was home to my boys; Danny Sharky the bookmakerâs son, chicken Kev, the sheep of the family. And Christy; precious son of my floundering imagination, floundering son of my precious imagination. This is the place Iâll recreate, in sufficient detail that if in a hundred years time itâs completely destroyed, people will understand why. 	Creating a sense of time is another requirement. At the point in question it had been just after the War for over thirty years. Children in primary school playgrounds still sang about Hitler only having one ball. 	Punk was happening. Contrary to myth it was nothing to do with having no future, and everything to do with leaning forward into the future, the time when good things would be possible, sometime soon, soonish, sooner or later, later, maybe. Nobody raises their own expectations; someone has to give you a clue. For some people punk was that clue. It was a chance to think about something different, is a chance for me to talk about something different. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. We made our own entertainment in those days. Etcetera. 	When do I mean exactly? Say from 1976 to, perhaps, the end of 1978 when the whole Pistols thing had turned into a massive punch up between some accountants. Or later maybe. Hard to know where anything begins and ends. 	People wax nostalgic about punk now. But Iâve been spared the temptations of nostalgia. What I havenât been spared is the cause of nostalgia, the view of the flatlands ahead. 	Anyway, thatâs enough of that sort of stuff to be going on with. Here I am then, old enough to be my own parents, a know it all, know nothing narrator. Iâm ready to dive in and make a beginning, so here I go, making stuff up and remembering things.

         			        	CHRISTY 	The first time I really felt wrong was soon after Clair went. Her and Mum never got on. But they got really bad in the summer of seventy six. That was a shitty, horrible summer, that. Baking hot non-stop. It was a dry hot but it still felt like there was a storm coming. But the storm never come then. It got swallowed and thrown up later.  	The heat give me headaches. Felt like me brains were bursting. I used to lie with the sheets kicked off, hearing them two shouting. 	I never understood it. It was like Clair was in a permanent strop. She hated it on the checkout but that couldnâtâve been all of it. It scared me. The way you couldnât work her out, couldnât get a clue. Think I felt jealous of her a bit, being able to shout and go, and act like she didnât deserve a shit time of it. 	Donât know why she went, but I was expecting it, her going. A bit after Christmas I heard her talking to her mate Deb. Deb worked in the caff up by the Bill. You could always smell cooking on her. She was humped over a bit because of her platforms. They come in from the pub. There was two lots of laughing then they went in the front room. My room was next to it. I turned the radio down so I could hear. 	Deb said, âYou heard back yet?â 	Then Clair said, âNot yet. Only just got the form in. Got a good chance though. With the money it is.â 	Deb said, âBlind school though. Theyâd want experience.â 	âGot experience living here. Nobody so blind as someone who wonât look.â 	Then she shut the door. I couldnât hear any more. 	Not long after that she cheered up a bit. The rows stopped. Until the last one. 	Couple of days before Easter I come home from school and there was a minicab parked out the front of the house. The bloke was stood by the car. He had on this brown and white zip up cardigan like the one I had. He was tapping his fingers on the roof of the car. His nails were black with shit. He seen me going in at the gate and said, âTell her Iâve got the meter running son. Sheâs taking forever.â 	The front door was wide open. Them two were in the hallway going mad at each other. Shouting and shouting. I canât remember what they were shouting. I just stood there looking. 	All down the stairs there was clothes on the floor. Clair started picking up the clothes and stuffing them into this green suitcase. Then she tried to shut it but the catch was broken. She was kneeling down saying, âFucking thing. Fucking thing.â 	Then they went quiet. Mum went in the kitchen and got some string. She give it to Clair. Clair tied up the case and stood up. She walked to the door. Mum stood there with her arms at her sides, lifting them then letting them drop, like a penguin. 	Clair walked out. I followed after her, a bit behind. She speeded up when she seen I was following. I said to her, âWhere you going?â 	She said, âOff my fucking head!â 	She got in the cab. The bloke didnât need to say about the meter running; she couldnât get away quick enough. He tutted and went, âThank fuck for that,â under his breath. I watched the black car leaving.   	The way it looked to me, that was the last I was going to see of her. Mum mustâve thought sheâd gone for good too because she never said anything when I moved into the upstairs room. Iâd had enough of being downstairs, overhearing things. 	I didnât want to move Clairâs stuff out. I wanted to be in the middle of it all. Mum thought I was being daft. She got me to put it in the cupboard under the stairs. It nearly all went for jumble in the end. 	I kept a couple of Clairâs things. To remember. When she went she took all the photos with her in them, as if she wanted it to be like she never happened. I kept her name badge from work plus a tube of her psoriasis cream. It smelt funny. When I was smaller I asked her what it was. 	She said, âVanishing cream.â  	I said, âIs it?â 	She said, âFucking wish it was.â 	I put the cream and the badge in the shoebox I had under me bed. I didnât like looking in it but I wanted to have it there. Afraid of forgetting.  	Before, I used to sneak things away to put in it. There was two photos. Used to like them till I found out. One of them had Mum and Dad standing in a field of grass. They were close enough for their shoulders to touch but they couldâve been in different pictures. Mum was at an angle to Dad, smiling and squinting into the distance, like she was trying to remember something.  	Dad was stood with his shoulders sloped, as if he was under extra gravity. He was looking straight into the camera, frowning, like whoever had took the picture had just asked him a question he didnât understand. His lips were a bit apart, like he wanted to say something but he couldnât. Thatâs how I felt. His eyes and his nose were like mine.  	In the other picture he was younger; late twenties or something. He was leaning on a gate, sleeves rolled up, pipe in his mouth, big grin. Behind him at the top of the photo there was this big thick bar of black cloud. It looked like it was going to come down on top of him. I wanted to reach into the picture and warn him. 	There was this wooden hammer thing from his work. There was dents in it from when I used it to bang in a nail. Wish I hadnât done that. 	There was two of his records. One was Louis Armstrong singing âWhat A Wonderful Worldâ. The label was black, the writing was silver. I hated it. I thought the words were stupid. Iâd sit and look at it and try to imagine Dad listening to it and enjoying it. The other was an L.P, âThe Man of La Manchaâ. Most of it was bollocks but I liked âThe Impossible Dreamâ; the words made you feel better. 	Then there was Dadâs spare pair of glasses. I found them at the back of a drawer in the kitchen. I tried them on once but I didnât like the feeling.    	So I put Clairâs things in with that lot.  	Near enough the first thing Mum said after Clair went was that we should have a holiday, me and her. She said, âWeâre still a family after all.â 	I didnât know what she was on about. We hadnât been away for years. It was like putting on an act. 	She booked a weekend break at Butlinâs. We got the coach to Weston Super Mare. We were sat across the aisle from this bloke who kept farting. I read till I felt sick then I went to sleep. 	The camp was set back from the prom. There was big Chinese-looking gates and this pink tarmac driveway called Welcome Boulevard. Looked like a big dirty tongue. 	I got the first twinge when we walked in. It was crawling with people. All I could see was faces coming at me. They all looked the same. Me breath started catching. There was this rushing in me ears like being under water. 	We checked in and found the chalet. Mum kicked her shoes off and lay on her bed reading the booklet they give you saying whatâs on. There was a talent night on in the family bar. The booklet said it was a chance to meet new friends or some bollocks like that. I had a bath in the block near our chalet. The bath was all gritty on your arse. 	Everything in the bar was either sticky or greasy; the glasses, the tables, the carpets everything. Up one end there was a bit of a stage. On it was two blokes in velvet jackets. One had on a bass, the other was sat behind an electric organ.  	They nodded to each other and started playing âThereâs No Business Like Showbusinessâ. The compere bloke bounced up and took hold of the microphone. His hair was grey as a badger round the ears and brown everywhere else. We were a few tables back but I could still see his dandruff. 	He told a few old jokes. Then he come down with the mic and chatted to a few people. I was dreading him coming near us. He stopped at the next table and talked to the two girls sat there. When he walked off one of them said to the other about how his breath stunk. Then there was a game of âTake Your Pickâ. People took it in turns to pick envelopes that didnât have a tenner in. 	Then it was the talent competition. It was all teenage girls doing their Shirley Bassey bit and blokes in their forties slaughtering âSpanish Eyesâ and âGreen Green Grass Of Homeâ and that. It was depressing the way they threw themselves into it, like something was going to come of it.  	All through it, the backing blokes looked like they had something sharp up their arses. Every time someone sung an off note the bassist pulled a face like heâd bitten into a bit of silver paper on a Kit-Kat. 	This milkman won it. He was skinny and nervous-looking. He done âI Remember You.â I looked at Mum. She was humming along and clapping time and smiling and bobbing her head. I slid down in me seat and hoped nobody was looking.             	 	We went in for breakfast. The dining room was the size of a warehouse. We got shown where to sit. You had to sit in the same place the whole time. We were on the end of a table beside an old couple. Every now and then the woman smiled sideways at Mum. Mumâd smile back then look back down at her cornflakes. It was like the old woman was trying to think of something to say. Then the rumour reached our table and she didnât need to. 	People said it was a boy. That it was two blokes. That it was a woman whoâd gone swimming nude. In the end the old couple asked the waiter. He dished out the kippers off this rack thing and leaned over to tell us. He said how a bloke and his grown up son had been walking back to their chalet the night before and the son had decided to have a swim in the outdoor pool. Both of them were pissed. The son had all his clothes on. He was in trouble straight off. The dad couldnât swim. All he could do was stand there watching. The boy drowned. 	I didnât feel like eating after that. I sat there trying to imagine it. People loved it though. Give them something to talk about. The old woman next to us was having a good gas with the family on the other side. I heard her say how she wasnât being funny but at least it broke the ice a bit. 	I mooched around on Saturday morning. Mum come round with me, trailing a couple of feet behind. She said she didnât mind just watching. We went in the games room. Everything was being used apart from a couple of the dart boards. She wanted a go at playing darts. Two turns in a row she missed with all three darts. I stood there itching and feeling hot. There was blokes with their sons all looking and grinning. She smiled and shrugged and bent down and picked up the darts. 	There was free films in the afternoon so she went to one of them. I went on the chairoplane. Other people screamed, but I couldnât feel anything. I went out the camp and sat on the beach till teatime come. The sea was so far out it was like a line between the sand and the sky. The beach was mud. There was a smell coming off it like chicken gone off. 	Teatime, the old couple tried to talk to us again. They said I looked eighteen. Said I had really long fingers like I played the piano. They didnât mean any of it. They just couldnât think of anything to say to us. There was a proper family the other side. Bit by bit they started talking to them more. 	Saturday night Mum went dancing in the ballroom. Before she went she give me some two pences to play the machines. I went down the arcade and played pinball. A kid my age come and stood by the machine, watching. I looked at him a couple of times and he went away. 	Sunday was more of the same till after tea. Then whatever happened, happened. We were walking back from the dining room so we could get packed. Seemed like there was hundreds of people come out of nowhere, coming towards us. Felt like I was going to get swallowed up, lost in all them people. 	Jellybean taught us in Biology about how everybodyâs eighty per cent water. I used to wonder why you didnât dissolve when you got in the sea. That was what the feeling was like then, like I was going to get dissolved. 	The faces were coming at me again. All smiling. Eyes dead like fish. There was sweat all down me back. Me legs were shaking and going bandy. Me head was hammering, felt like it was swelling up. Donât know what it was. 	I run for it, off the Boulevard and across the grass. I didnât even look back. I heard Mum call after me. I kept running, all through the chalets, round the edge of the camp till I was buckled over. I lay face down on the grass getting me breath back. 	After a bit I walked back to the chalet. Mum was in there packing. I never said anything to her about it. And she never said anything to me.

      DANNY  For a long time I wouldnât even think about it. But Iâve thought about it since Iâve been here; thought about it until there isnât anything more to think. It wasnât my fault I donât reckon.  It was the school holidays, Easter 1976. We were living in Yeovil. Mum and Dad were at work and I was looking after Kathy. Iâd just done us both scrambled eggs and bacon for lunch. She was sat on the kitchen floor looking at a book, flapping the pages backwards and forwards. I was dossing about drinking tea and reading the Mirror.  Iâd run out of cigs and I was gasping. Kath was good for seven. Iâd smoked in the house before when it was just me and her there and you could trust her not to grass you up. Not even by accident.  So I got her to put her shoes on and we headed up the shop for twenty Craven A. We got to the cross-roads and went over to the shop. I got the fags, and a Twix to split with Kath. We came out and were stood at the kerb waiting to cross. Then it all started happening. The traffic wasnât even that bad. It mustâve been quick but when I remember it, it goes on forever. I heard the bell on the shop door go. Ray called out that heâd short-changed me so I started walking back towards the shop. I was pulling Kath with me. I still had hold of her hand; I know that for a fact.  Then this noise burst behind me like a house falling down. I looked round and thereâs this lorry. I still had hold of Kathâs hand. The back end of the lorry flipped round by about three foot.  I tried to pull Kath out the way but I was too slow.  It looked like it barely clipped her. Threw her yards though. I had her hand held tight in me fist, but when she got hit her hand just slipped away, dry and smooth like there was talc on it or something.  She went up and forward. I started running, fast as I could, like I was going to catch her and sheâd be alright. But when she hit the ground I knew that was it. She was bent up all wrong. The driver never stopped. They never caught the cunt.

      			KEVIN 	It came as quite a shock to the system, it really did. I didnât see it coming. They made me not expect it. And it wasnât just me. Phil said later that nobody wouldâve thought it of my mum and dad because they were so steady and careful. We were the sort of family that just plods along quite nicely. 	Mum and Dad had always been the quiet kind so I didnât notice any atmospheres or anything like that to begin with. I say quiet, of course they talked to each other but mostly it was day to day things. It used to be nice, sitting in the kitchen listening to the same conversations coming round again. Comfortable. Like the way the front gate always squeaked, or the way Dad always wound his watch after tea.  	You never used to hear a raised voice in our house. Even with me when I was little, I never needed a ticking off. Then when I was in the fourth year they started going out separately. Theyâd never gone out much before and when they did it was always together; parentsâ evenings, the Christmas social with Dadâs work.  	Dad was first. I donât know for certain where he used to go, but he was out a lot, and he always took the car. Then Mum started going out to loads of church things. Just to get even, Dad said later. 	Then the arguments started. Once Mum smashed all the plates in the house; just stood there smashing them on the floor, one after the other. Afterwards they sent me out for fish and chips. 	Around then was the only time I ever heard Dad swear. They were arguing because Dad had come home late and left the cheese out of the fridge all night. Terrible the things he shouted at Mum. I went to my room and put a pillow over my head. 	At the start of that really scorching summer things seemed to be getting better because they started going out together once a week. I thought they must be off somewhere nice because they always went out done up quite smart. It turned out later they were going down the Marriage Guidance. 	One day towards the end of summer term I came home and found Mum in the lounge, having a bit of a cry. She told me Dad had left. Gone to Bristol with the Saturday girl, Elaine. Just like that. It knocked me for six to be honest. Out of the blue like that. 	Nothing was the same after. One minute we didnât know anybody whoâd have that sort of thing happen, then suddenly we were those sort of people. Mum got herself a little job at the sorting office. She couldâve done better for herself really. A shop job or something. 	All the way along nobody sat me down and explained anything. All the time things were going wrong I wanted there to be something I could do to fix things. Iâve tried not to dwell on it all. Doesnât bear thinking about.

                 	         CHRISTY 	I couldnât believe it. Couldnât take it in. It knocked everything out of me. Scared me rigid. Couldnât speak to save me life. I put the papers back in the box, shut the lid and sat on top of it like I was trying to stop it from ever opening again. 	I ran to the bog. Felt like Iâd swallowed something rotten. I leaned over the toilet breathing in Harpic and heaving, but I couldnât make it get out of me. 	I took the spare Yale off the hook and slipped out the house. Walked up through Fortuneswell, scraping the yellow key up the side of every parked car I went past. Started pissing with rain; sheets of it. Me eyes stung but I kept walking, out to the end of the island. Think I had to get to where it happened. 	All while I was walking there was this weight inside me like something black and wet and dead. 	I got to the Bill and climbed down onto the big ledge behind Pulpit Rock. I sat with me legs hanging down over the edge. I looked down at the sea and the rocks and the waves, me clothes getting soaked with the spray and the rain. Then me guts come up all hot and sour in a big blurt. I sat there on me own with me jeans covered in sick. Two hundred yards behind me the Pulpit Inn was kicking out. 	Donât know when it happened. Canât get it in time. Itâs a mystery. Most things, you can work out when they happened because theyâve got some sort of  sense, because one thing leads to another. Not this. 	Thatâs when I started going out wandering. After Mum and Clair had gone to bed Iâd let meself out of the house. Iâd drift round the island like I was looking for something. Iâd walk past all the houses with their front rooms blue like fish-tanks from the light of the telly. But I always ended up at the Bill, back in the same place. Iâd stand on the edge of the land looking out to the sea. And nobody knew I was there.

      			WILLSON						        	Christy waited, annoyed with himself. Heâd been given a chance but he was no use. Dannyâs mum opened the door. 	âSorry to bother you. Iâm Christy. Iâve come for the band practice.â 	She squinted at him, one eye clenched against the trickle of smoke rising from the cigarette in her mouth. âHeâll be up the top of the garden.â She led Christy through to the back door. 	He saw Danny crouching near the shed. Danny called to him. âDo you want to see some puppies?â 	As he got closer Christy saw that Danny was crouched over a bucket of water. Beside him were several tiny greyhound puppies, pink as piglets, wriggling and tumbling and climbing over each other. âIâll be there in a minute,â Danny said. âIâve just got to do these. They empty the bins Monday.â He hitched up the sleeve of his jumper, picked up the nearest puppy by the scruff of the neck, and stuffed the dog down into the water. 	âChrist Danny. What are you doing?â 	Danny looked up, his face expressionless. âTeaching them to swim.â He pulled the dead puppy out of the water and tossed it onto the hessian sack beside him. A couple of the other pups sniffed around it casually. Danny picked up one of them and drowned it. 	âWhy, though?â 	âTheyâre spare. Dadâs always bollocked on about breeding them for racing. So he bought a pregnant bitch for Mum at Easter. Mental. We havenât got the space and Mumâs not up to it at the moment.â He drowned another. âThink he thought itâd give Mum something to do.â 	Christy watched as the pile of dead dogs grew. âI thought she was working in the bookies with your dad.â 	âNo. Sheâs been on the sick. Bit run down.â 	One dog remained alive. Danny nodded towards it. âKeeping that one. For meself.â 	âWhy that one?â  	âWhy not?â 	Danny loaded the pink carcasses into the sack, tucked the surviving dog under his arm, and walked to the house. He put the sack in the dustbin and placed the live pup next to its mother in a basket in the kitchen. 	Christy stayed at the top of the garden, shivering slightly. 	Danny returned, wiping his hands on his jeans. âThought Kevâd be coming with you.â 	âNo. Heâs making his own way. Whereâs Phil to?â 	âShould be here soon. Heâs gone down Radio Rentals to get the Stranglersâ L.P.â 	When there was no band practice, the Weymouth branch of Radio Rentals was the focus of the other option for killing a Saturday. Danny, Phil, Christy and Kev would loiter in the record section, waiting for their lives to happen. They would squeeze into the coffin-shaped listening booths. Carol the assistant would pretend to believe they were going to buy the records they asked to hear. They would flick through the album racks hunting for anything that might have been recorded by people with short hair. 	Punk records were trickling out but mostly they had to be ordered. The waiting was delicious, second only to that bigger waiting for the end of school when theyâd have money for all the records they wanted. If an order came in theyâd all go round Philâs to listen to it. If nothing arrived theyâd move on to the Cadena cafe, where, with the exception of Kev, theyâd smoke themselves yellow. 	Danny and Christy went into the brick and timber shed. Inside, the smell of creosote and paraffin made Christyâs mouth water. He propped the bass guitar heâd been carrying against Philâs amp. He placed a black bin liner next to it. 	Phil and Danny had been playing together for six weeks. Six weeks of Phil  chugging and crunching at the two movable chords he knew, groping optimistically up and down the neck of his guitar. Six weeks of Danny frowning, hammering, moving around his drum kit like somebody trying to kill a small  quick animal. 	 	Danny had plans for them. He always had plans. His constant leaning forward into the next good thing was visible in the strange headlong way he walked; as if he were living his life in italics. At their first practice ideas had rolled out of him. Within sentences a band was formed, signed up, and living in London.  	It had been Philâs idea to ask Christy and Kev to join the band. You couldnât just leave people out, leave people behind. Danny was reluctant but the choices were few. Nearly everyone at school was into Genesis and Yes. Christy and Kev at least listened to the right records, at least listened to John Peel. 	The plan was that Christy would play bass, using one borrowed from Philâs brother Paul, and Kev would play keyboards. Danny had found a childâs Bontempi organ in the attic. Back before his dad went, Kev had piano lessons for a couple of months, to keep up with the neighbours. 	As Christyâs eyes adjusted to the near-darkness a squirt of laughter shot from him which he tried to disguise as a sneeze. âWhatâs that?â he asked. 	âMe kit.â Danny stood at an old ironing board. In the middle of the board was an ancient snare drum. There were bristles on the skin of it. At one end of the board were two Quality Street tins padded with cardboard. At the other end was a partially dismantled typewriter with a small childâs xylophone taped to the carriage. The whole kit was held together with straps, nails and carpet tape. On the floor beside Danny was an upturned galvanised dustbin. There was no bass drum. When Phil had remarked on this Danny had confidently explained that a bass drum was just for show, somewhere to display the bandâs name. 	Christy looked at the kit, then looked at Danny. Danny looked back, as stony-faced as Buster Keaton. Christy said nothing. It was something that interested him; the way Danny would have a stupid idea and just front it out, daring anybody to take the piss. 	âWhere you learn the drums?â Christy asked. 	âTaught meself. I was in a band for a bit in Yeovil.â  	âYeah? What were they called?â 	âFucked if I remember,â Danny mumbled. 	Christy frowned. âHow come?â 	Danny straightened. âThat was our name. Fucked If I Remember. I never chose it.â 	Before he met Phil, Danny had never played the drums before in his life. He just felt like hitting things.  	Danny stubbed a Benson on a flowered saucer. âI had to leave nearly all me proper kit behind when we left Yeovil.â 	âHow come you moved to Portland?â Christy asked. 	âJust did,â Danny said. He made it sound like, âShut up.â The subject was closed. 	After the accident heâd gone blank for a while. His hair came out in handfuls. Months later he still had bald patches the size of fifty pence pieces. There is a photo from when he started at Royal Manor. In it he is death white. His hair looks like an explosion. 	His parents acted like something out of a nursery rhyme. One of them couldnât leave the past alone, the other wouldnât look at it. So between the two of them they decided to move. 	His dad asked Chant for a transfer. Anywhere. They ended up on Portland. Danny was relieved to be somewhere where he had no history. He met Phil in his first term at Royal Manor. Christy and Kev sort of came with him. 	âHow did you get on with the bass?â Danny asked. 	Christy looked at the guitar. âI donât think I can hack it. Iâve been trying but it wonât sink in.â 	Phil had spent hours trying to teach Christy the two songs he and Danny had written. Deep down Phil knew Christy wouldnât get the hang of it as long as he had a hole in his arse. Christy practised in his room for hours, every good boy deserves, every good boy deserves, but it was no good. He had no sense of time. Playing music, he began to feel, was all about maths and confidence; he couldnât do one and he didnât have any of the other. 	Danny kneeled down to light the paraffin heater. âWhat you going to do then, keep trying?â 	Christy looked at his shoes, then at his hands. âI was saying to Phil. I had an idea.â He reached over and pulled something from the bin liner on the floor. 	âWhat the fuckâs that supposed to be?â 	Christy looked meaningfully at Dannyâs drum kit. In his hand was a rectangular wooden tray. Screwed to the tray were three small transistor radios and two battered cassette players. His mum had come home from a Holy Ghost jumble sale one Saturday and presented him with a box of electrical leftovers sheâd bought for fifty pence. While he was checking which pieces of junk worked, inspiration came to him from nowhere. 	He plugged into the hot-smelling bakelite socket in the wall. A babble of speech and music spilled from the contraption. Christy hunched over it, retuning the radios, rewinding the squawking tapes, adjusting volume controls. Every time it seemed like he was finding a rhythm, making something like music, a blurt of noise would throw everything into another pattern.  	Danny watched, his head on one side. Eventually he nodded. âItâs got potential. Give it a proper go when Phil and Kev turn up.â 	He looked at his watch. He sat on a deck-chair in the corner of the shed. Christy perched on a hardened bag of cement. Danny looked at his watch again. He looked at Christy. âAny news about your sister?â 	Christy coughed, surprised. âNo.â 	âPhil told me. Said you donât even know where sheâs gone. What happened there then? Didnât she get on with your mum and dad?â 	âItâs only me mum about.â 	âHow come?â 	Christyâs mouth twisted. He picked at the cement sack. âMe dadâs dead.â 	Danny knew but he wouldnât leave it. âMustâve been pretty young. How come he died?â 	Christy imagined kicking Danny in the mouth. âIt was something to do with his heart.â He shrugged. 	Danny stared at Christyâs face. He blew two plumes of cigarette smoke from his nose. 	Christy stood up. âWhere do you reckon Kevâs got to?â 	âChanging the subject?â 	Silence fell. The morning dripped by. The paraffin heater popped and whispered. Danny sat watching Christy. Christy stood chewing the skin at the side of his fingernails and trying to think of things to say. 	When he was bored, Danny had a habit of holding his cigarette between his thumb and second finger, and tapping the burning end with the tip of his forefinger. Christy looked at the tip of Dannyâs Benson. 	âWhat?â Danny asked. 	âNothing.â 	Minutes passed. âWhy are you so quiet Christy?â 	âWhy am I so quiet?â 	âYeah. Why donât you talk to people, for fuckâs sake?â 	Hate all the howsyourfather. Asking and asking and asking. Like being peeled. Mrs Davies the fat secretary in front of everybody. Just for the records, any one not got both Mum and Dad at home? Kev gives a nudge under the table. Feel the buckle on his sandals on the leg. Hand wonât go up. Lift it with the other one. She looks. Just for the records. Sarah says is diddums daddy deaded then? Ian all interested. How? Just did. How? Just did. Couldnâtâve just did. Stupid.  	By the air raid shelter the others are singing. Whereâs your father whereâs your father, whereâs your father Christy Cross? Havenât got one, never had one, youâre a bastard Christy Cross. Ask Mum when thereâs nothing on the telly. Lips moving like sheâs reading a book. Itâs a rude word for someone who hasnât got a dad. 	Kev knows about the scraping out the fridges. And the Widowed Mothers Allowance. Queue for dinner. Him and Phil in front. Donât see. Laughing. His mum gets widowsâ memories allowance. Spends it all on sausages. 	Christy exhaled. âNo reason particularly.â 	The back door of the house opened and closed. Danny looked out of the shed window and saw Phil. He stepped out and met him halfway up the garden. âYou took your time didnât you? Iâve been waiting with Christy. Like being stuck in a lift with a fucking deaf mute. And the twat says he canât play.â 	âHe told me on the phone.â 	âSo whyâs he bothered turning up?â 	âI said he could still join the band. Heâs still a mate.â 	âYour mate.â 	In the shed Phil explained his lateness. âI stopped off at that tailorâs to pick up me jeans. Them flares he was taking in. Werenât ready so I waited.â 	The stooping solo backstreet tailor apologised and smiled. Heâd been getting behindhand. He didnât know what was going on with the youngsters. Phil was the third person that week whoâd brought in jeans to be narrowed. 	âNo sign of Kev then?â Phil asked. 	âNo. Twat.â 	âShall we give him a bit longer?â 	âNo,â Danny said. âIf he canât show up on time, fuck him.â He picked up the Bontempi organ and placed it on the ironing board. He took up his drumsticks and played a roll around the kit, ending on the keys of the organ. âRight. Letâs make a fucking start.â        	 	In Karenâs small, warm bed, in the house on Avalanche Road, Kev and Karen were making spoons, curled into each other like speech marks. Kev studied the swirl of brown hair at the nape of her neck. It made him think of a Walnut Whip. When he blinked he could hear his eyelashes scraping across the pillow. When she blinked he could hear hers. 	Her dad was a plumber so they had central heating. It was warm enough to have the covers off. Her parents were away for the weekend but they would have let Kev stay over if sheâd asked. He was a steady boy. 	They had known each other since primary school. She used to come round his to play. He used to go round hers to play. Everybody thought he was daft, being proper friends with a girl. Since his dad left the friendship had become something else; the youth club, the pictures, the under 18sâ disco at Deja Vu. And now it had changed again, forever. 	Heâd tried to stop himself from wanting to do it, but that just made him want to do it more. And it was so lovely, even with the messes and the noises he hadnât expected. It was something about the way sex made time stop. There was no planning and hoping or remembering and wondering. There was only the feeling of being in the middle of everything. 	He waited for his cock to soften, then pulled on his Y-fronts and jumper. He went into the kitchen to make tea and toast. He stood looking out of the window while he waited for the kettle to boil. It was nice, this. Like a marriage. Like a home. The kettle whistled and the toaster coughed up another two slices. He loaded the tray and returned upstairs. 	Karen was awake now, sitting up with her back against the headboard. She smiled at him, wiped sleep from her cheek. Kevin poured tea for her and placed the tray at her side. She drank and ate, grinning. A shred of marmalade fell and landed where the curve of her belly began. Kev picked it up and fed it to her. 	âWerenât you supposed to be having your first practice with Philâs group today?â 	He hadnât forgotten. âIt wasnât anything definite. I said I might be late. Anyway, Iâd rather be here.â He kissed her on the forehead. 	âChristy might be nervous. First practice and you not there.â 	âHeâll be alright.â 	Her breakfast finished, Karen curled onto her side. Her eyelids bumped shut, once, twice, three times. Her mouth opened loosely. 	Kev couldnât take his eyes off her. She was pink and she was white and she liked him. Unbelievable. He leaned down to smell her. Her armpits had a faint tang like the curly shavings from a newly sharpened pencil. At the back of her knees were tiny veins which reminded him of a marble heâd had in the Infants. There were bumps like buttons all up her spine. Her body wasnât beautiful all over but it was interesting everywhere. He wanted to wake up every morning forever next to someone like her. No. Not someone like her. Her. Just her. Her. 	He imagined Phil and Christy and Danny, waiting for him in the cold shed. He knew it was a bit off to let them down but he wanted to stay where he was. He wanted to keep his good secret thing secret. Theyâd probably start without him anyway. Karen was waking up again.

      More good things to add to my earlier post about the gushing fan-mail. Didn't make it to the open-mike night at the squat in Tufnell Park due to transport problems but went to Filthy McNasty's in Islington to see The Standards. Billed in the ever-unreliable Time Out as punk'n'roll they were in fact more like a pub duo for people with impeccable record collections. But most of all they were great fun. In the absence of their usual drummer they made do with the rhythm backing of an Argos keyboard, which gave them a bit of a John Shuttleworth vibe. Sold no copies of the novel as the band only played one set so there was no interval where I could approach people. Beer and me is a mystery. Tuesday I had four and a half pints and was as sick as a whipped dog the next morning. Tonight I've had 4 pints and I'm as right as rain. I fear I'm playing Russian Roullette with my liver. Came home to find documentation from a 'Fact or Fiction' mail art project I took part in a while back. I sent a drawing of Elvis along with a 200 word story about the time he went for a job as an agony aunt. 'If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair? What sort of damn fool advice is that?' You get the idea. Received a lino print and a collage in return. Most pleasing of all was the list of contribuotrs to the project. I now know my 'artwork' has been displayed alongside pieces by somebody called Mortimer Bastardface. Most gratifying. You can't put a price on stuff like that.

      Just got an email today from somebody who bought a copy of my novel from me at an Artrocker gig. I'm always braced for somebody asking for their Â£2 back, but apparently he thought the black car leaving', was, and I quote 'fucking brilliant!' I read the email in my teabreak at the Lee Harvey Oswald Memorial Library, and went back on the counter grinning like a bastard. Ironically I was at Artrocker on Tuesday for the first time in ages, and got cold feet about approaching people to try and flog a few copies of BCL, because I'd done it so many times there before. Really do need to get back into doing the face to face sales, despite my shyness. Still 80 odd copies left and they're only really selling in one of the shops that stock it because they've been kind enough to put up a poster of a review of the book, and have featured it in their local author's section. It's been an education really, this whole process. learnt so much about how culture and commerce work [or don't work, more accurately. Off to do a reading tonight at a squat in Tufnell Park. Lunchtime I changed up the $6 from an American mail order sale. I spent it on a sandwich. Mmmm .Big time.

      Right. Got the first draft of the radio play 'Close Up Magic' done, albeit after throwing my pen down after every other sentence and muttering, 'Christ, this is shite.' I really need to buy into an idea to put enough effort into it. Maybe part of the problem is I'm not that keen on a lot the drama I hear on the radio. Recently heard one about Laurel and Hardy that was completely misconceived. For the bit I heard Olly was too ill to speak. So Stan was having this ludicrous one sided conversation like in the old Lassie films - kind of 'What's that Lassie? The kids have fallen down the abandoned mineshaft and you think one of them might be suffering from concussion?' You get the idea. I will probably end up retrieving the play as a story. It was worthwhile as an experiment. I forgot to mention on Sunday, the first pub I went in had a vending machine selling DVDs of porn. I once saw a vending machine in a club in Ladbroke Grove which sold sex toys, but the DVD thing is a first. I don't know why they don't go the whole hog and give away a free baseball cap with every purchase, bearing the message 'I'm away home for a wank.'

      Decided to launch this new blog. The content will be similar to my old one but hopefully with a bit more of a positive emphasis. Hopefully, this'll feel like turning over a new leaf and there won't the same amount of whingeing as previously. Also you can do  bold  and  italics  with this newer version. Sad, huh. Spent this morning slogging away at that play. I'm near the end of the first draft. It hasn't really worked but I might retrieve it as a story. Glad to be near the end. Got some good new ideas for stories so feel more enthusiastic than I have for a while. Been listening to the old cassette tapes that I'll be taping over when I give away the cassette  mini-album I've just done.  Amazing how many there are and how little I've listened to them. Mogwai about the only one worth saving so far.  If anybody wants to claim a free copy of that 6 track tape let me know thru the comments option and I'll see what I can sort out. It's called Waste and it's the first of a series of four called 'Waste Not, Want Not.'  Might be good if you can send some stamps for postage but I'm not that bothered.
