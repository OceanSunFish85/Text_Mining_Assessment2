       Since I have started this blog midway through summer, I`ll recall what I have done thus far. On May 21... The class of 2004 graduated from Hatley Highschool. No, I wasnt one of them fortunately. Why am I happy you ask? Well, unlike most people I actually like highschool. Anyways ill get into this later...     I was asked to be an usher for graduation ( basically each usher had different duties to do, i passed out pamplets at the gate lol ) It was really sad to see some of the people go, ill miss a few of them. After graduation was over, I went home to change. My friends Drew, Callie, Jake, and Jamey were going to go eat ata local steakhouse ( i think people from out-of-state call them mom and pop joints..) We ate and had a good time. Afterwards we went to Jake's house and got in his hot tub, nothing really happened after that. We all talked then went home.     I woke up the next morning around 11 o`clock expecting to get ready for our trip to Florida, which we were to leave earlier that morning. To give a quick history of this trip, its kind of a tradition that we started. I grew up with a group of kids who all live in the same neighborhood. They are Jake, Jenna, and Brea.My cousin Brittany moved in to that neighborhood later on ( me and Brittany have been together since we were born, we are the same age) Anyways we all go on a trip every year, last year we went to Florida and we really enjoyed it. This year however a friend of our parent's ( Mrs. Christina) father had a stroke and delayed the trip a few hours ( it was worth waiting for ) Anyways the trip to Florida was very interesing. Jenna didnt go because she graduated and went with her boyfriend to travel the country with his grandmother..... yea or something like that. On the way up there it was my mom, brittany, jake, and I in my mothers SUV. We always make each other laugh and was a very enjoyable, but long, 8 hour drive to Ft. Walton, Florida. We didnt get there till late night, about 1 am. We were drained so we went to bed almost immediately after arriving, except for my mother and aunt who went to a local grocery store for food. The next few days were amazing. The beach was crystalclear, waves were big on some days, no seaweed, no jellyfish stings, no sunburns ( for me!). There was one or two days were the beach had to be searched because there was an invasion of Portugese Man-o-War's ( a type of cnidarian related to the jellyfish, commonly believed to be a jellyfish) The funny thing is, my 10 year old cousin ( Blake ) caught 3 OF THEM. I took some pictures of them and of Florida that i will post in a bit. Thats really all that happened but it was great!
