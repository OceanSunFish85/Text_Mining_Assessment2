      I live in a condo. It is a nice condo.  I live on the second floor. If some one comes by to visit, they press the button for my buzzer. I will then pickup the phone and buzz them in.   Today is was having problems with my cable. I was on the phone with Time Warner and on a long hold. Then my door phone buzzed. I put Time Warner on speaker and answered the door phone. It was some one who said that they had something for me to sign. I asked who they were and who he repressented. He would not say. I told them that I was busy and went back to my regular phone waiting for Time Warner. While I was on with Time Warner the door phone kept buzzing for about 5 minutes and then stopped. I guess that he just went away. I still don't know who this guy was. But at least my cable is working again.

      I met with my men's ACT group to day at St. Matthews church. We had mass first and the met in a small room in the church. There were only four of us. We discussed Gary Guillory's divorce status and how he is feeling. He informed us that Dr. Murphy was going to side with him and that she will recommend that he gets custody of the kids.   Another member started discussing his marital situation. He was explaining that he is tired of his wife's taking advantage of him. If she leaves clothes on the couch or forgets to do something then he has to pick up the slack. He has expressed how tired this makes him. But he also expressed that he figures that this is a small price to pay for peace with in the home.

      Saturday 7/31/04 my ex served me with papers, taking me back to court.  She is wanting the back child support for the period that I was not working.  In the motion, she is requesting that I be placed in jail for nonpayment.    I have been working since the beginning of June and have been making the child support payments for the past two months. Now I will have to hire an attorney.  This will cost money that I cannot afford.  Sadly I will have to use my car to pay the attorney.
