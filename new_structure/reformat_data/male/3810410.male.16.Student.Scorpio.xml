      So just go ahead and put the knife to my heart Either stab me now or rip it out again Do what you want The choice is yours... Cause I've given up on all senseless reason I've given up on acts of indiscretion Go ahead and kill me once more Just another way you show your perfection... I had a burden of giving you what you wanted I had a load of receiving your complaints But the measure of this world canât compare to this Cause it canât outweigh all my pain Go ahead, keep it all in, never give out before you go Go away, keep all those thoughts, never gave me the time of day What is really going on right now? You tell me that nothing is wrong, but I can tell that all is You try to change the subject, but one thing is only on my mind What is wrong? Was it something I said? Go ahead, keep secrets from me, Iâve never kept any of mine from you Go away, keep your wounds, I thought we would say it all upfront  What is really going on today? You claim you are busy, and canât be disturbed Itâs like you have another life, and I am unaware and unwelcome to it Well guess thatâs the life weâve made Guess thatâs the games we play But itâs like I always lose and I can never win So I think today I will quit before I can begin Goodbye, goodbye Always hated leaving first, but now I fear the worst  So long, so long Always hate to admit it, but I can not forget it  Iâm leaving now, better stop me before I go The doors getting closer and I just hate to leave Hello.

      Your eyes-  How often I find myself lost in them, kind of like a fairy tale They take me away to a place that seems so very real Your goodbyes- How much the words hurt me, even when youâre gone only for a while Canât you stay longer, make my dreams come true, just walk the extra mile Cause you know that I would do it all for you  I donât need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden Iâd carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, Iâd be there before you Just donât keep me waiting much longer  Your mouth- Sweeter than the roses that resemble the color of your lips So perfect, so flawless, I would give it all away just for one more kiss Your soul- Gleaming of vibes that I could never comprehend, but I try to  Lights my way and gets me to the pathwayâs end, and I need you Cause you know that I would do it all again for you  I donât need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden Iâd carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, Iâd be there before you Just donât keep me waiting much longer (x2)  You, unlike me, see the world through better perspectives This viewpoint I have, canât see much at all But youâre in my range, seems so strange to be here now  I donât need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden Iâd carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, Iâd be there before you Just donât keep me waiting much longer

      So go ahead and forget me I am not to be remembered But at least we had some good times Remember them before you say goodbye I can change with the flow I can, so I need to know just what to say What do I need to do? I know youâve heard it before But the only thing I got going for me is you  I can pretend that I donât notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say Iâve been holding my breath so I wonât take in your air Itâs intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away  So go ahead and overlook me I am not to be recognized But at least you gave me the second glance Recall us now, cause you never believed in second chances I can stay this way forever I can, but would this make it better if I did? What do I need to prove? I know youâve read this note before But the only person Iâd give my heart to is you  I can pretend that I donât notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say Iâve been holding my breath so I wonât take in your air Itâs intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)  Let me give you a dozen roses Let me give you a dozen years Iâd give you all the time you needed But that could never justify these tears  I can pretend that I donât notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say Iâve been holding my breath so I wonât take in your air Itâs intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)

      You are captivating, capture me, lure me into you Eyes so blue, intricate yet they intertwines mine to you I know roads ahead look daring, but if dared, would you come with me? Never let me go, I need you now More than I have ever needed you You are magnetizing, maneuver your way into my arms Hair is so fair, flawless and soft, I want you in my arms I know challenges await us, just wait for me, I will be at your every step Never leave me behind, I need you now More than ever before, more than Iâve ever needed you You look like you need me too But this detour is blocking my way I donât want to find another way, you might be gone Will you still be there when I come home? When I come home  When I come home  When I come home  You are me, and I am you, tonight we are one I melt into you, you explore all of me, leave no place undiscovered I know regrets may come someday, but someway, I will help you through them Never let me go, I need you now More than you could ever know I need you

      Time- Time itself seems to be escalating And I canât stop it from penetrating our wounds that seem to stay Bind- Tie these things together Maybe youâll see things better when you are away (when you are away)  I have dreams, I have hopes I can breathe, and I can choke But nothing that you can say can reassure my beliefs that you are wrong You donât have to leave now We can make it if we try  Donât let this moment pass you by You donât have to leave  Desire- I hope for so much more, but I will be pleased with what you give Iâm not so selfish you see, all that I ask is for honesty Tired- Iâm growing so very weary, carry me home, I canât make it Wake me up when you return, I deserve all of this so donât fake it  I have dreams, I have hopes I can breathe, and I can choke But nothing that you can say can reassure my beliefs that you are wrong You donât have to leave now We can make it if we try  Donât let this moment pass you by You donât have to leave  Now that you are already gone Does it please you to know that I am not feeling so well? Now that you are gone for good Does it help you sleep better at night, knowing Iâm not alright? You donât have to leave  I have dreams, I have hopes I can breathe, and I can choke But nothing that you can say can reassure my beliefs that you are wrong You donât have to leave now We can make it if we try  Donât let this moment pass you by You donât have to leave  Nothing that you say or do can replace your goodbye

      Iâd do anything for you to notice  When I am around But you could care less I see The vacant expression is showing And I know when to say quit But you and I both know that I wonât let you go  Writing letters, Showing I am alive Nervous again, âI think Iâll wait until tomorrowâ I hold you eyes in my head I remember your voice  But do you remember mine? This is like out of the movies But I am the one who losses all  What if I could win? Would I be the head honcho? Or would I still be who I am  The one who canât take âNo.â  Iâd do anything for you to notice  When I am around But you could care less I see The vacant expression is showing And I know when to say quit But you and I both know that I wonât let you go Well when all is said and all is done I will still be standing  When all is defeated and has been overcome I will still be standing  I will be waiting for you

      Itâs Friday night Time for us to put on our show This has become routine Are we growing into our roles? My act has become overused This worn-out mask I wear is growing thin I think I should go But that face you give It keeps me in my place And I give in with no trace of deception Seemed she never wanted me at all Seems the finer things she required All the gems that couldnât buy her Were they put to good use? Or did she use them like she used me? Letâs forget tonight Leave this all behind Start over new, fresh and reborn But are growing into break ups? My act has become overcharged You never gave me the benefit of the doubt I never wanted out, but you seemed to have changed Letâs rearrange our settings But Iâm betting youâre not thinking the same She never wanted me at all Seems the finer things she required All the gems that couldnât buy her Were they put to good use? Or did she use them like she used me? Did she use them like she used me? (Iâm on her string) Did she use them like she used me?

      Here is my heart âFor Saleâ nailed for viewing Here is my apology âI wonât take back the words I said You know I was right.â You lied in saying weâd make it until the end Well Iâm recyclable to you You use me over and over Thank you, come again  Here is my face âCaution when wetâ tears cascading Here is my finale âI promise this will be it for me And you today.â Well you lied in saying we wouldnât follow the trend I must seem reusable to you You use me over and over Thank you, come again  Why do I put myself through this? Time and time again I put myself through this pain I build up my downfall Thinking youâd change I change myself to seem better to you  And you lied when you said weâd still be friends Well Iâm reconstructed from the pieces youâve broken me into  You use me over and over Thank you, come again Thank you, come again Thank you, come again

      Kiss me once, just for good luck Then maybe youâll see things more clearly Hold me tighter, until I feel suffocated Or at least pretend youâre holding me more dearly One day has gone by And still I fight these cries that the telephone is giving, so unforgiving One river that runs dry Washed away all my lies that Iâve been saying, that you find riveting So kiss me once, just for good luck Then maybe youâll see things more clearly Hold me tighter, until I feel suffocated Or at least pretend youâre holding me more dearly Tell all your friends that we just reacquainted  And go ahead and fake it one more time Tell them lies, recline on the edge of this world And go ahead and rock this boat one more time Two days have passed by And I give in with no sigh, but let it overtake me, Iâm over aching Two streams that intertwine Hold the same tears that gave a sign of how I am feeling, Iâm over faking Kiss me once, just for good luck Then maybe youâll see things more clearly Hold me tighter, until I feel suffocated Or at least pretend youâre holding me more dearly Donât let the door hit you on your way out Cause by now I hope you know I wonât hold it for you Keep those secrets and bad deeds Live a lie and away from me, keep all those who adore you Donât let the door hit you on your way out Cause by now I hope you know I wonât hold it for you Keep those secrets and bad deeds Live a lie, away from me, keep all those who adore you

      Tell all your friends that you just ended it for us Laugh about it, make up your stories I hope that you are happy now, cause I am down I want that note back, that Love Letter that has somehow found its way into your drawer I also would like back my heart, or unless you have secretly kept that too Just give it back, back to me when you are through It seems we are all we have, and I want you back so damn bad But this masquerade is a never-ending process And you think that youâre fooling everyone, but you arenât fooling me  Keep your door closed, and keep all my clothes I donât want them back- Your scent still lingers on them And that aroma you left still surrounds my bed Like a pheromone ghost, it still haunts my head I canât stand it any longer Itâs a never-ending road, that only seems to get farther And I have lost touch with love  Tell all your friends that you didnât know what you saw in me Cause I donât know either, but what would I care? I hope that you are lonesome too, cause I am  I want back that hat that I always wore And that jean jacket that seems to be torn  Itâs almost as if you tore out my heart I throw out my notebook that Iâve had since 8th grade Itâs filled with our notes, yeah it was great But this masquerade is a never-ending process And you think that youâre fooling everyone, but you arenât fooling me  Keep your door closed, and keep all my clothes I donât want them back- Your scent still lingers on them And that aroma you left still surrounds my bed Like a pheromone ghost, it still haunts my head I canât stand it any longer Itâs a never-ending road, that only seems to get farther And I have lost touch with love  You know, what they say has finally come true I never knew what I had until I lost you You were my jewel, gave me such pleasure One manâs trash is another manâs treasure And I treasured you that best I could Even if you never understood all my intentions that I held close To my heart, but I fear the most, it happened everyday And that aroma you left still surrounds my bed Like a pheromone ghost, it still haunts my head I canât stand it any longer Itâs a never-ending road, that only seems to get farther And I have lost touch with love Can you bring me back to love?

      I know that we just had our secret rendezvous, but itâs a killer when you must leave These feelings that Iâve been holding back are needing to be released And if I say them it seems like another dÃ©jÃ  vu,  It must be because there was another âItâs me, not you.â How much more, I wonder, can this relationship withstand?   Weâve survived some of our hardships, and this time our bleedings canât be mended I used to be the cure youâd use, but now I am your tool to abuse And say youâre not alone, but I am alone (on my own) I get lost in your eyes, they capture me with their trances, a trend you intended to follow Hope you are happy, I am hollow and falling away  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And itâs tearing my seams, and all seems black   I just need to be rolled up and put away until you need me again Itâs cold out here, in this place, and I canât survive this season It used to be the time of romance, yeah, our time to spread or buds and grow But we seem to be rotting to the core, trampled on and buried deep in the snow I received your letter, it was delivered on time this time It was only three words, not the three that I used to love to say âI Hate You.â written on the paper, shouldâve been written in stone And now itâs youâre fault youâre alone, but I still am alone (on my own) I get lost in your eyes, they capture me with their trances, a trend you intended to follow Hope you are happy, I am hollow and falling away  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And itâs tearing my seams, and all seems black  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And itâs tearing my seams, and all seems black   I know that we just had our secret rendezvous, but itâs a killer when you must leave These feelings that Iâve been back are needing to be released, suppressed without much ease And if I say them it seems like another dÃ©jÃ  vu,  It must be because there was another âItâs me, not you.â

      Breaking up Breaking up all the good times that we had Taking up Taking up all the time I was thinking we could spend   Well at least you said we could stay as friends At least, you said, the phone calls wonât have to end But that phone call never came, and I havenât been the same since you left me  Making up Making up stories just so you donât have to come over Waking up Waking up alone but with that note you left me on your pillowcase  âIâve had enough, I just canât take this anymore.â  But you said weâd still talk every once-in-awhile Occasionally, Iâd hoped youâd stay true to your word  So this is just a phase that canât be mended now Iâm just a hopeless romantic, I canât break out And so this is the end of this relationship What a shame, what a shame  Break down Break down that overhanging light, that seemed to shine for you Bring me down Bring me down cause I just caught up in all of you  Well at least you said we could stay as friends At least, you claimed, we could try it all again But it seems that I have thrown it all away, while Iâve been waiting for you Iâve had enough, I just canât take this anymore  But you said weâd still talk every once-in-awhile Occasionally, Iâd hoped youâd stay true to your word So this is just a phase that canât be mended now I guess Iâm just a hopeless romantic, and I canât break out And so this is the end of this relationship What a shame, what a shame  And so this is the end of this relationship What a shame, what a shame And so this is the end of another relationship What a shame, what a shame

      Alarm is ringing, time to start my day again What will happen? Or is it just another daily routine? No surprises, just a tedious expedition into my unknown Is there a way to push rewind? If there is I want to set my world back to then When you came, changed me the way  The way that it felt to be alive  Six forty-five The day isnât getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe  Phone is ringing, time to beckon some willingness to be What will occur? Or is this another call of someone just like me No amazement, just a dreading thread that pulls me into the web Am I just a little overdue? Cause sometimes I feel like Iâve been a little overused When will you come home? And can you change me?  Change me into the way that it felt to be alive  Six forty-five The day isnât getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Maybe I will just be âokayâ  Interesting how it all turned out Seems to real to think that this is my life But they say that itâs not the end of the world Well itâs the end of the universe to me,  And I still donât feel like I am alive  Six forty-five The day isnât getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Six forty-five The day isnât getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Maybe Maybe I will just be âokayâ Maybe it might seem I am on the menu to start over yet again

      I know when Iâm not wanted Itâs when I am wanted I am not prompt Itâs an inconsistency, such an inconvenience   But itâs like you say youâre here But to me your sound is muted Guess I shouldâve of seen it all along Guess this shouldnât be a song Cause whatâs the point?  When no one sings I can write these words, but do you know what they mean? Well I mean the best, you mean the worst I canât decipher your meanings or codes Well I was last, you were first I can make it to the finish line on my own I know when Iâm not wanted Itâs when I am wanted I am not prompt This is my last goodbye This is my last farewell
