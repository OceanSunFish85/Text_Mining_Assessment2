      If you believe, That we've got a picture perfect plan, We've got you fooled, 'Cause we only do the best we can. And sometimes we make it. Sometimes we back it. But we get one step closer each and everyday, And we'll figure it out on the way. -Lizzie Maguire, "The Lizze Maguire Theme"   the first day back from break was amazing. it made me realize how much fun school had become. we worked more on our research reports and fam. tree projects, and english was fully devoted to romeo and juliet.  on monday we got a pysco bomb threat and they came in to shonicks class (A3) and they were like "kitty" or thats what chris remembers hearing. and then on tuesday (the day of the first fight of the week) we found out there was a bomb threat. bleh. it was some shitty teens who were trying to rob a bank and like i dunno.. it was in the paper.. i guess i shoulda read it..  wednesday (i think) was lisa's birthday and her, kate, emily and tessas dropped into the library during my break. we sat around and talked and lisa had this HOTT shirt that tess made! jorden stopped by too. oo yeah, since they ditched they all had fake names.  lisa- marie porter jorden- nathalie green tess- elizabeth kate- can't remember..  it was awesome. the history homework had been lightened because Mr. Shonick wanted us to devote time to our research reports. the next day, in english, we performed the opening to romeo and juliet. chris was tybalt and i played benvolio and that BITCH STABBED ME!! i think my dagger was defective... but i got him back, in the begininng ot the party i was capulet and he was tybalt again and i hit him in the back of the head for wanting to kill romeo. freak. kidding~ chris hastings is the coolest. alyssa was romeo tho! shes sooooo skinny.. and lisa was juliet...  on friday i went to math as always, at 7:40, then i had my open so i went into the library and had to sit thru the dancers dancing. bleh. eric watson was in there... and a bunch of girls.. LIKE THE MISSING ONE!! oh yeah, this chick went missin on wednesday and there were 2 more fights that week... so i wrote nathalie a 10 page note which took the whole entire period...  well anyway, after my break i skipped PE cause i really didnt feel good so i went with christina (who has an open B3) and so we walked around soquel village in the rain. she shared a bunch of personal stories with me and i shared some with her.. it was a bonding experience. we went to this like "Lion Park" and there was rain and stuff.. and we went to this yoga place and i almost died laughing!! it was great! then we went to the baglery and ate and we started walking back to school so i could get my camera (not that i had anyone to ake pictures of at harbor!! bleh!!) and we saw christina's mom and so we went to try and get crystal and nathalie outta class but they wouldnt come... so christina and i got my shirt and my camera from my locker.. and then stopped my longoria's room to wave at katy, matt, carson and chris... oo i think alec was in there too...  well we got in christina's car and drove to harbor. the bell hadn't rung yet so we decided to go walk down to the bus stop to check the times but then we got to mud and i was like "nuh uh!" and so we walked back up to the school and we talked with matt and tina and elena and fidel and NAOMI BRADFORD!! she is my harbor lover! i swear, if it wasnt for her i would have tottally had a shitty time. but yeah..  while naomi was off somewhere i was talking with elena jin and nathalie called so we went to go find her and steve saw me and he was like "BEN! BEN!" and i thought he was talking to me but i guess not! cause im not BEN! SORRY STEVE! :-(  with crystal + nathalie there it was a hell of a lot funner! christina and nathalie and crystal and i tottally shined! it was awesome! i would do it all again.. except i would've looked for jaye.. and maybe talked to michael and tell chris albrect (dominic's butt buddy) that i wasn't gonna beat him up.. ha thats funny...  so the bell rang and i went up to tina and hugged her for like a minute and she was like "get off me!" and then we started to walk down to the bus stop. it was shitty and muddy and i called jack vidnovic to try and get a ride but he had already left. stupid A days.. we got down to the bus stop right as the bus pulled away. "oh well, only 15 min." we thought. so we sat. and waited. and there was still no bus. so we sat and tapped our thrid eyes like that chick from Rich Girls. and STILL NO BUS CAME! so we were just about to start walking when this bus came around the corner and we all got on and paid money. i sat with christina and across from us sat nathalie and crystal. this girl new gabi, nathalie's cousin, and she talked to us for a little bit.  we decided on that bus ride that the next time we went to harbor we would PLAN IT OUT waaay ahead of time!  that weekend i got some early christmas presents like NOW 14!!! its a great CD!! luken is the awesomest!! and on saturday i drove up to SF with Andrew Galvez and his two friends, Kathy and Veronica. it was cool! and we went shopping EVERYWHERE!!  banana republic, urban outfitters, abercrombie, american eagle, victoria's secrets, fcuk, macys (OO IT WAS SOOOO FUCKING PRETTY!!), and i acctually think that was it.. hmm.. mebbe there was more... there were a lotta gay guys! and it was super fun cause andrew was there and he bought me in the zone and i bought myself the missy elliot CD. it was one of the BEST days of my life!!  on monday it was a pretty normal C day.. until english. our counselors came in and talked to us about college. i had a lotta questions and so fromnow on when anyone asks "any questions?" chris turns to me and says "brandon?"... yeah.. we also got our schedule options for next semester, but i didnt wanna change anything... well the whole talk was really exciting... it really opened my eyes and that night i searched online for college resources and academic standards.. and i was talking to JACK about it and he said that i didnt EVER come across as the INTELLECTUAL type! psh!! i guess its true then, he REALLY doesnt noe me!!  on tuesday and wednesday i was in full college over achiever mode. i asked questions (like chris knew i would) in all my classes and my french teacher said i was too much of an acheiver and that i would prolly end up killing someone one day. :-D oo i also met micheal over the phone monday and he was pretty awesome. thanks for transferring my calls dominic! even if you did have a shitty weekend and got drunk without me FOR THE SECOND TIME i still love you.. except not. on wednesday i even went to a french club meeting!! it was sooo cool!! we're having a french club party in january and spencers house! spencer the guy, not the girl!! he's soooo hott! tess and tiana and nathalie and naomi and kate are gonna be there too!! its sooo cool!  thursday was rainy. i dont like the rain. but at the same time i love it. we traded rough drafts in shonick and everyone who read mine said that it was good but no one could give me feedback. blah... that day after school while ellen and i were waiting for our ride, i danced with annie under the eaves and then hannah and i talked about starting a club.. lol we came up with funky names.. it was hilarious!! but then my dad came so we left~  friday was boring. nothing fun happened EXCEPT I BEAT hannah and elizabeth and emila and ivy in knock out! hahaha! can't touch this! it was really fun! but yeah when i got home i worked hard on my report and thats basically what i did all weekend.. i slept a lot on sunday and i finished my french family tree project that day... and on saturday (with help from juntado) i started THIS BLOG~!! and on saturday i also watched BUFFY SEASON FIVE~ HELL YEAH IT KICKED ASS! i cried at the end of "The Body" but, of course, dominic was there to kinda cheer me up.  monday i brought my family tree project. we worked more on rough drafts in shonick and thankfully it was so short tat we didnt work THAT long... bleh~ monday was lame.  tuesday was better. we had a sub in math and we did book work the whole period... it was easy and i finished early so i wrote a note to nathalie. piano was awesome and i passed a bunch of songs and got my grade up to a B.. all i have to do is pass 3 more songs and i get an A!! we played this really fun game and i was on a team with the lockewood sisters and ellen and angelica and umm... some other people who are REALLY cool but i dont noe their names. HAHA we brought briana, sara and lisa (not biancalana)'s team DOWN TO CHINA TOWN!! it was great!! the funniest part was annie was sick! the one day we have loads of fun she gets SICK!  well in shonick we did rough drafts for the last time.. the report was due on thursday. oo yeah katherine read mine and SHE DID A SUPER JOB~~ seriously!! she was the only one who could like.. correct it at all!! she is tottally my next pick for proof-reader... ooo in english we watched a scene from romeo and juliet and he had to pants on :-o !! it was.. magical.. as stephen would say.. oh yeah, him and i stopped fighting that day!! it was cool i guess...  wednesday we played knock out again.. its such a fun game! we also tried super knock out which.. i guess.. is where if the person who gets you out gets out by soemone else you're back in. so you win by beating EVERYONE~!! we didnt really finish.. but elizabeth and i talked a lot about.. mm.. stuff... mostly candy.. and during my open i hung out with tiana andkate in the library cause tiana needed to finish her family tree project. she has a really cool family.  thursday i wore abercrombie pajamas! they have mooses on them. we had a sub again in math and we played pictionary AGAIN.. oo we did that on wednesday too.. i forgot to write it tho~ anyone, my pajamas caught everyone's attention and yeah! it was fun stuff. we turned in research reports in history and watch the simpson's odessy and the simpsons hamlet!   "Now when people get wood they'll think of Trojans.." haha flanders...  anway, it was nice having a relaxing day in every class. i wished everyone i had A days with a Merry Christmas before it was over.  friday was the best! i got flooded with gifts.. and i talked with marissa and cloey (shoreline people) in the library. haha i tottally thought of the perfect april fools joke!! thanks marissa~!!  in pe ivy and i made up funny stories while running around the gym.

      If at first you don't succeed, Dust yourself off and try again. You can dust it off and try again. -Aaliyah, "Try Again"   this was a really fun month. it starts on the saturday of kassie's birthday party.   Kassie's friend rachel (this really funny girl from scotts valley, who i hung out with in jully...? sometime around then, we anyway, she) had a friend named luigi who came out and was all gay and stuff. well he gave rachel a book and an invite to the party he was having the next week at his (WOOT WOOT) BEACH HOUSE!! so like yeah.. i was thinking about going but they all said he was ugly so i kinda reconsidered..  anoways the party was really fun! we all were playing ddr and then it was like pizza dinner or something.  rachel+ kassie shared a seat and going left there was: stephanie, cali, kayla, cody, jourdain, ellen, kalie, teena, me and monica. well i kinda sat on the edges of both teena and monicas chairs. BAD idea. i almost fell... twice. and i was wearing my nice sweater...  well yeah after presents (wow, there were alotta animal stuff!) we got ready to leave.. and then we left for THE CORN MAZE~!! the ride up kalie and i sang country songs cause kassie's mom really like the western station.   so we get to the maze and like we go in the entrance and this guy tells us aboutthe maze and its all cold and dark and we can hear music from the haunted ranch place and so we like go in and we wander around finding different things and yeah... we end up all getting seperated, me with cody young. cody and i kinda kissed akwardly and yeah.. we continued on and kassie, teena, rachel and all of them jumped out and scared us. but no one was as scared as monica. i felt bad for her... but anyway, i was with her and then the chain saw guy was like somewhere and we ran and it was so scary.  From the windoooow To the kitchen!  Put some hot sauce on that chicken, Damn yo breath is kickin'!  So eventually we got bored with the whole "wandering-around-the-maze" thing and we decided to go str8 to the haunted ranch. now when we got to the entrance it was kinda creepy but it didnt seem scary at all!! teena was scared so since kalie had gone already, her and teena went out of the maze and waited for us at the exit.   in line, the actors (who were in costume), would try to scare us. first it was this vampire lady with big boobs. she scared me and kassie was like "don't worry, he's gay!!" RIGHT when she said that word a bunch of guys turned around and kinda looked at me. they were really cute, but yeah i figured they were red necks or something...  so we waited in line and i would ask all the actors if i could have a hug cause i ain't 'fraid of no ghost *wink* and then we got ready to go in and we annoyed this bunny man. a lot. so we went in the maze.. kayla, kassie, rachel, cali, stephanie, cody and i. everyone else went after us. it was really creepy in the begininng and cody fell and he was like "leave me! leave me!" and i was like "you are not being left behind!" and i piggy backed him thru the rest of the thing.. oo and i met a really cute vampire who was flirting with me and he was REALLY cute in his vampire make up. so we get outta the place after passing this scary girl who looked like she crawled outta a hybrid of the ring and the shining, we got to the CHAIN SAW GUY! and he like chased us it was soooo cooool!! and then we like left and on the way home teena and kalie were talking about the boys that had turned around when kassie called me gay, and kalie was like "they were touching each other and stuff... tottally fruity!"  so yeah.. i called jorden richardson (the jourdain that was with us was different then the other jorden..) and jorden and i talked and yeah... kassies mom dropped me off and teena promised to give me the book on monday at school.   so i got home at 1 and fell asleep pretty fast... on sunday i slept all day.. i was so tired!  monday started with high hopes of the soon to be 4 day weekend. the library was FINALLY reopened after an awesome renovation. and stephen (this guy i met in october) left school do to independed studies. anyway, on wed. night stephen "came out" and by friday the whole school knew so he was pretty pissed at me. but whatever.. he was kinda lame.  OO annie ross's birthday was on thursday! it was so great i got her a monkey and she got a bunch of other shweet presents... oo yeah, mesha and i wore the monkie on our legs and made it look like it was humping us.. :-D annie got these balloons from tanya and while mesha and i were watching her stuff, one of the balloons blew onto the grass and POPPED! and then annie came back and mesh and i were like "noo!! it was the grass!" and annie didnt believe us and so i took the other balloon (she got 2 small ones and a big.. um.. shiny one) and i was like "noo!! the wind popped it!" and i shoved the balloon against the grass and it popped and i was like "like THAT!" and mesha started crackin' up! it was great! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNIE BANANNIE~  saturday was suzie's SECOND party. in the morning i went shopping with teena and kendra and got some shweet pajamas. i was gonna meet dominic there and get my shirt back but he got their too late and we left. then the PARTAY~ i met some.. "new" people and it was a lotta fun! im even glad the rowland went dispite the fun we all had. no more vodka for ANY of you! tess is the my best sober friend! lol.. and yeah.. that party was cool but then the cops busted it at like 1 or 2 o'clock. i wasnt there tho but tess was upstairs and like the police told everyone to come down but she didnt so hahaha! i bet it went on their perm. record.   well the next day i hung out with matt and andrew galvez, old friends from cazedero! andrew is REALLY HOT and he's so sweet but he's kinda old.. and now we've decided to be friends until im older.. you noe how it is.. oh yeah, hes 20~ but that night was alotta fun and a lotta laughs! poor matt's prolly trumatized now tho :-) !  the monday of my fourday weekend i stayed home and worked for cash~! it was a lotta fun despite how it sounds, especially cause i watched the first two seasons of angel.~!! and tuseday i hung out with nathalie at the mall-o. i think christina and tina and sarah went too... mm? yeah. i got a sweater and um... i think i bought tina panties :-p  the 3 days that we were in school were kind lame. we didnt really do much in any of our classes except a test in shonick. but that wasnt too hard. i didnt do anything that weekend either. just homework and chores. cha-ching.  so the next week was the last full week of november. wootie woot! we started romeo and juliet in english, our fam. tree projects in french and our final research report in history. we learned how to use athena, this book search thing, in the library, and i got a bunch of nifty books on Joan of Arc.   that weekend i did more chores! i had made/saved 200 and was tottally ready for my shopping spree at valley fair after thanksgiving. on saturday i went to tinas house and she tried to kill me so i hid in her bathroom. but anyway, her and i talked with nathalie from 5 to 12 ish BEATING my record with DOMINIC~!! ha you lost! it was great but then i fell asleep and it kinda ended...   the last two days of school were crazy! i wished everyone a happy thanksgiving and in english we did this REALLY COOL shakepearean dance and like SOMEONE touched my ass!  patrick and i were the last ones outta mrs. miranda's class on the day before break.

Yeah yeah uh. -Moulin Rouge, "Lady Marmalade"  haha, the month started out great! school was awesome and everyone was so yeah..   but of course my history caught up with me and I began hearing and thinking more about dominic.   i saw him for the first time in 2 months at the mall (of course) and i kinda walked past him. he really pissed me off with his little pissy-ness but whatever. it was a fun day with janis, sally and monique. OMG! we saw ellen in the car on the drive home it was HILARIOUS!   school went on as usually... not really much change. alec was kinda acting weird and chris and patrick were a lil on the alert mode too... i think chris was stoned one day..   annie was lots of fun to hang out with and mesha as well.. and ivy was great.. i met tess in october at aldos. she was really fun and we got to be friends really really fast. michele was cool too and i talked to her and katy quite frequently.   first sat.: can you say kaboom? it was the anual monte carlo fireworks. nelli scored free tickets from kathryns mom.. lol.. even tho i bought a bunch from chris hastings..   i ended up going with kathleen and planned on meeting carolyn, nelli and katy there. i saw chris and carson (really funny guy from the h/a) there with alec. alec kinda gave me the glare and i talked to carson and chris for a little bit but continued looking at the really awesome booths.   Dominic came later... after carolyn and nelli and katy had arrived. lol! carolyn's dad is awesome! well back to dominic~ i let him borrow my shirt for no reason since he had a sweatshirt but whatever. i didnt noe i wouldnt get it back until 2004!! &gt;:-o!   well he ditched us for other harbor people WHILE WEARING MY SHIRT!  so we wandered and i saw elizabeth and naomi and jorden and alyssa and even van dyk! the coolest math teacher from shoreline!!   the fireworks were magical. it was sooo pretty. and i wasnt that far from the rest of the soquelians.... so yeah.. it was great. :-)   lol! this is the best part~ ok so the roads were all closed cause of like some fucked up drunks and we walked to the gas station to wait for kathleen's mom. on the way these cars honked at us and i slapped my ass!! and then at the gas station i swear something was in those bushes!! well at like 11 kathleen's mom and really funny sister darlene got their and we drove to the bank and then BK to satisfy those midnight munchies :-P!   the fireworks weekend was great.   second weekend: snooze! i slept all weekend.. it was great!!   school was getting more and more fun! i was getting closer to everyone.. even patrick and i found common ground~ This is halloween, this is halloween...  the thursday b4 harbor homecoming i called dominic and he was too drunk to talk to me.. so he HUNG UP!!   thrid weekend: Harbor Homecoming go pirates! go pirates! bleh~ this weekend was kinda lame. i met tara at the frosh game and sat with tess and ivy and tara and katy. it was all good. then nathalie and tina and crystal came. after the frosh game i took a quick pic of luken! damn he transferred outta my pe class :-(! well yeah, then ivy, tess and the 3 shorline chicks all went to the deli with me and we ate food. lol.. then i farted.. BUT IT WAS TINA'S FAULT!! tess and ivy left and so i went with kalie and naomi back to the game. that was the first time i saw chris albrecht, dominic's fuck buddy. YUCK! well he was.. um.. "alrite" as nathalie put it.   well i saw dominic a lil bit before the half time of the Varsity game. annie and aby were there too! god i love annie! shes so funny.. and aby changed it this really gross porter potty... half time was kinda weird.. there were dancers.. enough said... i stole tina's lip gloss and almost O.D.ed on it! yay... i stole her soda too..   well then i went and sat with naomi and talked to this really hot guy (who turned out to be taylor!) but i doubt he remembers me.. he was REALLY hot!! oh and i saw jack.. yeah.. no comment :-/  tina had to get a ride home with nathalie and crystal so we wandered around trying to find them but ended up getting really really lost... and yeah... we found them in the end and tina was like "BYE!" and she ran.. and then i talked to dominic and he was kinda iffy but he left with chris to fuck and get ready for the dance and fuck. thats like all they do. well at least hes HAPPY~!!! :-D  yeah well i left with kalie and naomi and it was alotta fun and i was sooo gonna go to the bon fire with jack rodriguez (from french) and a bunch of santa cruz fags but i got sick :-( ...  well school that week was lame cause i had the sniffles.. but i didnt have to swim... so boo ya! elizabeth and me chilled in the gazebo, or how ever you spell it, by the pool!  on thursday i went into the girls locker room for the THIRTEENTH time and like they invited me in and shit and then mrs. locke like fucking grabbed me and hauled me to waddel's office. i got detention, but still it was better than suspension which it woulda been if mrs. locke had her way. &gt;:-o!  the rallies leading up to our homecoming were great! and the homecoming rally was awesome. everyone wanted jeff gill to win (pshyeah~!!) but to rouse support ivy and i made up some poems  Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Damn Jeff is fine!! If I were homecoming crown, I would want him mine!  When you see him on the floor, Ooo la la, you gasp, VOTE JEFF GILL FOR KING.. Or we'll kick your ass~!!  the last weekend: OUR HOMECOMING~!!  it was sooo fucking awesome! so it starts out at the church place with naomi and we watch the parade and jeff and calire throw candy at us and its awesome! and corey was the head cheerleader and it was so cool! so naomi and i met ivy and michele and we walked up the long trail to campus. we see the parade and the band coming up the drive, and then michele and me and ivy go in early for the frosh game. we walk in and see tara and patches sitting up in the stands. so we all hang out during the frosh game and we buy food and patrick gets this little sugar packet and hes like "i think you dropped your name tag.." it was so funny and adorable! after the frosh game we went and chilled at surf city and i got a stoked strawberry.. my soon to be favorite drink!   we got back for the second half of the game and nelli came running over all frantic. "I need help with the freshman float!!" she said, "Will you help?" so patrick is like "yeah!" and we're like "patrick!" and he's like "remember that time.." "NO!!" but we ended up going because nelli is the coolest and patrick is kinda cute underneath it all. so we get to the big orange truck and we're like "no.." but we ended up decorating it and it looked great. tara and patrick ran to berverlys for markers and posters and streamers, and nelli, michele, ivy and i worked on the masking tape and shit."  Rc, the stupid butt hole, and his other senoirs got on their float.. ours was SOOO crappy. it was sad. i shared a sign with michele cause it was really big and when we went in we circled around and we made fun off the irish! ha ha ha ICE THE IRISH!! so yeah and then we went to our side and woot woot! it was fun. but they put ont he brakes and i fell on patrick. it was so much fun! alec and chris showed up and threw candy at us and patrick chucked this thing back at them.. and madalee and heddy showed up~!! they were supposed to be on the floats but oh well...  so after the floats we took down everything and i scored some pretty green shoes.. they were cute. well i went back and sat with naomi engleman this time (before it was all bradford) and amber from my PE class.. (ive mentioned her, right?) well it was great and after the game i went over to carolyn and we talked and then i went with her and madalee and heddy into the band room since naomi bradford was giving me a ride home. well it was fun and we all talked and then i left promising to dance with them at the dance.  i dressed in mardi gras clothing and my new abercrombie hat! i got to the dance and found ivy and michele and we all went in to the dance. ASB stickers really do pay off.... well the dance was fun. lots of freak dancing! the only girl i didnt dance with was ivy cause she didnt wanna with a gay man, and michele kinda danced with me but left. i had fun tho. SLOW DANCE SHOUT OUTS 2: Carolyn! Nique! and... um.. who else did I dance with!? Shit!!

      Fate fell short this time, Your smile fades in the summer. Place your hand in mine, I'll leave when I wanna. -Blink 182, "Feeling This"   the first day of school started kinda like i was expecting. ellen picked me up at 7:20 for the carpool. on the way i had a nervous twist in my stomach... kinda like constapation only less severe.  anyway, we got to school and i opened my locker. 2 - 96. i'd put my combo up here but there are some people reading this who i dont really trust... anyway, i went to my first class. Geometrey. we all stood outside, waiting for Mr. McConnell to show up. That's when I met christine. my first friend at soquel. She came from Holy Cross.. or maybe she got kicked outta there for not believing in god. Whatever, anyway, it was a lot of fun. i learned a lot about her and her fam. WOO HOO! she goes to hawaii every year!! cool beans! so our stubbly math teacher shows up and opens the door. he's already divised a seating chart, alphabetical order, and im stuck between alex baker and brett ackler. Now, alex is pretty cool. hes smart and all that. but brett.. brett stinks... literally... it's called deodorant. well we get our geometrey books and the lesson begins. my mind blanks and i look around the room... holy shit! im the only kid from shoreline! but wait, isnt that chris hastings.  ok, chris hastings, here's the deal.. in May i signed up to be in this intensive humanities course. The humanities academy. the orientation was in the soquel library, in May as well. i wore my spiffy cow boy outfit :-D! I met some cool people there... alec and emily. and, of course, tessa, tiana and kate were there. but back to the story.  so i see chris... and then we talk.. and he's a pretty cool guy. def someone i want as a friend. the bell rings and i look at my schedule... next stop, Piano.  well that was a boring class... i thought when i walked out of piano. all we did was fill out forms. stephanie hammond and ellen are in it with me.. ellen.. little did i know she was going to get way lame, way fast.  so next is my open. i head to the library and i sit down at a vacant table. then, a girl sits down. but not any girl.. it was spencer kaufman. one of the most popular girls at shoreline.  "hey.. brandon right?" she said. i nodded. then she looked at my schedule. "walter for pe..? always dress out and never chew gum. she said. we sat there quietly filling out forms that our A2 teachers handed out.  but pretty soon the bell rang for break.  i met christine and a bunch of other people at my locker. we all had relativley close lockers due to a mishap at orientation... ill get into that later.. anyway, for my first break i headed to my next class. History.. with Mr. Shonick.   i choose a desk next to christine, and pretty soon tessa, tiana, and kate come tortting in. we exchange hugs and "how was your summer?" and then they take seats near me. a bunch of other people come in. there's chris! and emily! oo and crystal! crystal and i have short convo and then she takes a seat next to me. well pretty soon this crazy guy with poofy hair walks in. class starts and we pretty much dont do anything except read and stuff.  the bell rings. my next class is PE.  i walk to the gym with christine and sit in the bleachers. our kinda chubby but happy looking PE teacher walks in. he calls roll and when it all done he gives us some forms. the guy behind me accidently kicks me. "sorry.." he said when i turned around. "hey, im jon luken.." this really skinny kid stares at me with a grin of braces. but whatever. he's cute. lol. we talk a bit but then its over and i head to lunch.  my first high school lunch! you noe what that means.. im going off campus :-D! on the way down with kalie and christine, i run into, GUESS WHO!! NATHALIE! nathalie and i became best friends over the summer.. and it wouldnt have been possible without the DC trip, but i'll get to that after the first day of school.. hmm maybe i should've talked about the summer first.  after buying soda and food at Hernandez, we walk back up the lazy trial (No way I'm going up Sucide Hill!)  English is next. we head back to shonick, cause thats what is says on our sheets, but he tells us to go to miranda. on the way i catch a glance from Alec! boy has he gotten hot over the summer. we fill out more forms in English. there's a lot to do, and we get new notebooks. chris makes a joke about my shirt, but its accepted. Ellen got me my shirt.. another summer story Iâll get to later.  anyway, after English I head to biology with tessa and chris. We have assigned seats and I end up sitting next to.. well.. a big hearted fat kid. Biology breezes by and im out of school. Ellen and I head down to the main parking lot to wait for my dad.   thatâs when I saw him.  I was sure he was gayâ¦ but whatever the case I felt like I had to find out more about this boy. Thatâs when I first saw eben.  ok.. so thatâs just the first dayâ¦ thereâs a lot more to talk about mainly the summer and stuff.. so yeah..  Later days :-D brandon

      Everybody's workin' for the weekend. Everybody wants a new romance. Everybody's going off the deep end. Everybody needs a second chance. -Loverboy, "Working For The Weekend"   oi.. the end of the summer.. so depressing. august got me addicted to soap operas and text messages. all my children is a really good show for a soap opera. they deal with situations like everyone else. but yeah.. i got over it when school started. my new cell phone tho... that was a big deal. i added every body i knew in, and i mean EVERYBODY.  august is also when i met bryan. heâs really funny but kinda sensitive... anyway, we got to noe each other and yeah.. we were friends.  ooo~ august was the month of the family summer trip. yay hawaii! the trip was a lot of fun, but i wish we spent more time on maui! i was just starting to get a good tan! anyway... we stayed at this really fancy hotel and i met a lot of guys.. you noe me.. :-D my aunt wendy lives in hawaii and i spent a lot of time with her too (no, not kalieâs mom wendy. wendy from my dadâs side)  one night my aunts wendy, debbie and norma and my uncle took us out to dinner at the outback. it was CRAZY~ norma and debbie got drunk and hit on waiters and this one guy hit on ME! plus the scary bus boy watched me potty. and i think the bartender was drunk too.   anyway.. i read a lot of books. the required reading for the Humanites academy was awful. bleh~  i got back on thursday the 14th. the day.. jamieâs mom passed away. this meant jamie would be leaving for washington (the state).. in less than a week..  on sunday the 17th i got a phone call from my âLink Crew Leaderâ telling me about orientation. lol. i knew from his voice that he was gay.  the orientation was 20th. and of course, nathalie left town the day before.   i picked up ellen, kalie and teena and we drove to soquel. orientation was crazy. my coming out had spread like wild fire. all the shoreliners knew. after a short speech from the president and vice president (my GAY link crew leader) we split into link groups.  the only shoreliner in my group was cloey, but that was enough. we talked about our summer and our exâs. my link leader was RC (like the soda!). and this other girl... we played a game where we had to remember everyoneâs name.. it was fun.   there was one girl in my link group. she was talking about biology and geometry and the humanities academy.. but i didnt remember her from the meeting. when we got closer to school i found out her name was nelli. everyone ran up to her and gave her hugs and she seemed mucho popular. i wanted to be her friend. lol. pathetic, i noe.  after link crew we took pictures. mine SUCKED! probably cause that guy keep telling me to turn my body. OMG! get this! his name â Harry Dong. lmao. well after pictures we got schedules and lockers. locker 2 â 96. everyone one with us got lockers around us. it was really cool.  i looked over my schedule. great. i had a 7:40 class. oh well. not that bad. after we were sure that all 6 of us- me, kassie, kalie, ashlee, teena and ellen- could open our lockers we headed to the parking lot and left. all in all the orientation was fun. oo! i met a guy named stuart saepia. none of us knew he would be kassie; first kiss.  after orientation we went back to my house and watched chicago. it was fun. we sand and danced. speaking of dancing, after the movie we played DDR. but yeah. i had to kick everyone out cause it got late.  that night i was talking to dominic about RC. he asked his ex-boyfriend jack and then jack IMed me and we talked. he seemed really cool.  the last weeks of summer all happened way too fast. the last saturday was kalieâs birthday party. kathleen and i got her CDâs. the party was so much fun. besides kathleen, naomi and lianna were also there. plus kalieâs boyfriend. woo hoo. lianna is kalieâs short but funny friend. sheâs tons of fun.  around 5 nathalie called from her trip. i sat down and i started talking to her. the conversation lasted 3 hours. lol. at 8 she left to watch the cheetah girls. she wished kalie a happy birthday and.. blah. it was over.  sunday (the next day) was awesome times 50! it was the day of sallyâs birthday. janis, matt, teena and sarah rorvick were there so was tina liang!   ive known sally since 7th grade. shes really athletic. lol.  tina is the coolest girl ever! her and nathalie were my best friends over the summer and they still (more or less) are. tina and matt got in this huge food fight during the party. it was great.  after ,we went back to sallyâs house and jumped into her pool. it was awesome. tina wouldnt get in tho.. but i almost pushed her in once or twice... but then she pushed me in... yeah.. good times.  the last day of summer i went shopping (duh!) we saw harry and amy and tessa too! it was so much fun, you have no idea!  but nothing lasts forever. and the summer that i loved so much came to an end.  i went to bed early, but i didnt fall asleep for hours. i couldnt stop thinking about school. oi.  -Brandon!! see yaa

      The tide is high and I'm holding on, I'm gonna be your number one. I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that.. Ooooooh noooo. -Atomic Kitten, "The Tide is High"   Woot woot! it's my b-day month!  July was insane, and it all started where June left off. On July second I was outside tanning cause i wanted to look good. the thought of Dominic being gay made me realize there are probably a lot of other gay guys in Santa Cruz too. so i tanned. and then i fell alseep. and 2 hours later i woke up burned. my whole front side was red. ouch.  i took a shower and put some aloe on it... but it didnt really help.  on the fourth I went with Ili to wilder ranch. i pathetically hoped that she'd invite dominic but she didnt. that little runt. jk!!~ wilder was a lotta fun... except i was burned... and the ice cream melted... but i had my stars and stripes boxers on!! mm yeah. then, when i got back home, my grandparents came over and we had pie and stuff. oo! and the fireworks were soooo cool! my dog like wet himself, but he does that every year.  the next day jamie, maya and kristen came over.  have i mentioned maya before? maya's a really smart and really cool person from shoreline. i've known her since the end of sixth grade when we had drama together. shes lots of laughs and shes really smart. her bat mitzvah was soo much fun!  ok~ yeah.. jamie and maya and kristen came over and we watched buffy. :-D! The Hush episode was really scary and my burn was really itching. ooh yeah, and jamie broke her leg and she had to go to the ER room on the second (the same day i got my burn!).  anyway, that was fun and then it was over..  so the next day i went to see Legally Blonde 2 with Kalie, Amanda and Bobbi.   Amanda is adorable! shes funny and cute and no guy can resist that. bobbi's lots of fun too and shes a good advice-giver. anyway, the movie was really good and outside the theater we saw Jake Scruggs, Emily Hasty and CHRIS HASTINGS. coincidence or what! oo i really liked that guy from the movie and i thought he was gay the whooole time.. but then he asked that girl to marry him and it was like "bummer..."  that night all i could talk or even think about was chris. i was talking to gina and she IMed me dominic's screenname. and he wa son. so we talked for 2 hours and somehow chris left my mind. i didnt even think about him again until mid august. dominic was nice and really sweet... it didnt take long for me to fall for him. but i fall for everyone so thats not saying much.  on the 8th we were going out and we talked on the phone for 6 and a half hours! my all time record.. at least until november. :-D. and by the 13th we had our first date. we saw pirates of the carribean and yeah.. it was fun.. :-D! overall dominic's a great guy.. or at least he was at first. but then things started getting shitty and yeah. it ended. THAT COOLEST THING is that ym's horoscope guide said that i would fall for a pisces and it said the 8th and 13th were lucky days, but the 22nd was a bad one. and i broke up with him on the 22nd. freaky.  the week of my birthday was crazy. i went shopping a lot. jocelyn and i got kicked outta abercrombie for modelling and hara fell in love with cheyenne. kathleen and kalie and i had a lotta fun trying clothes on at anchor blue  OH! Kathleen! she's bundles of fun, and she was my best friend last year. for her b-day i got her 20o bucks worth of stuff including DVDs, CDs and 100 balloons!  ellen got me a shirt from American Eagle and i PROMISED to wear it the first day of school. but before that i wore it on my brithday when nathalie and I saw how to deal. that was such a good movie. outside the theater we saw this old guy selling brownies and we said there was prolly pot in them. lol.  july was an awesome month, and the perfect end to the perfect story was my brand new cell phone. woot woot.  yup yup ~Brandon

      I will remember you, Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. -Sarah McLachlan, "I Will Remember"   the rest of June went by pretty fast. my time was mostly devoted to making collages of pictures from the DC trip and watching seasons 1-4 of buffy. as time went on more and more people knew about my sexual orientation. oo i redecorated my room too. anyway, the day.. well more like night was June 20th. Nathalie and I went to Capitola Book Cafe and waited for the release of Harry Potter 5. it was a lotta fun, and the Shoreline band played for a little bit. there were nasty milk and cookies but it was a really fun night. nathalie and i talked and talked about buffy and jamie added some stuff in.  jamie was really cool.. she went to shoreline last year but now shes gone.. well thats another story that ill save for august.  kristen was there too.. she was a grade lower than us, just like jamie. kristen is short, but shes cool.. and her hair is REALLY fluffy.  anyway, nathalie and i bought our books and then i waited around with kalie and naomi until it was time to go.  kalie's my cousin and naomi is one of her best friends... no explanation needed there.  anyway, staying up 'til midnight was a whole lotta fun and i wouldn't have as much fun doing it until kassie's party in november.  the weeks of June lingered on. two days after i got my book we took a trip down south to LA/Oxnard. i met a really nice guy at the hotel we stayed at. his name was Ben. anyway, i spent most of the trip reading and i finished the twice in eight days.  after we got back, my mom and i talked about my birthday which was less than a month away! i wanted a cell phone and she agreed that i should have one.  the phone rang and i picked it up. Ili. she's pretty cool and i've known her for a really long time. her and bonnie were the first people i told about me being gay. anyway, she told me to come see the play bonnie was in cause there was a gay guy there named Dominic.  "Dominic..." the name rolled over my tounge. "Hot name.."  anyway, i declined her offer to go to the play, but she left me one good thing to think about..

      It's something unpredictably,  But in the end, it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life." -Green Day, "Good Riddance"   there are some things you have to know about the DC trip.   40 eight graders take a trip to DC and NY at the price of $1600 and some other expenses for souvenoirs.    Day 1     at 4:15 i called janis and told her we were coming to pick her up. the car ride was icy cold. i could feel my stomach twist. my skin hummed with eagerness. we met at the airport around 5:30 at the United terminal, San Jose.   my stomach still feels knarly and i take some pepto bismol. anyway, we check in. my partner is teena davis. iï¿½ve known her since like.. 1st grade..? prolly. sheï¿½s really cool and i couldnï¿½t have asked for a better buddy. we check our bags and Mrs. Chavez gives us our boarding passes so we head to the gate. teena got stopped in security cause she had 40 hair pins in from grad. night. good times, good times.   we were all sitting around in the gate.  maya brodkey, ryan juntado, sarah rorvick, lisa vechionne, amanda yabarra, des cook, cerena barros, tessa libby, kate kahoano, kevin grassadonia, delia guerrero, nathalie servin, kevin deming, miguel dolores, teena davis, des cuneo, lizette lopez, jessica llanos, angelica solis, neil osterman, stephen mccon, elena rossman, miki burns, augustine perez, aaron melim, janis dinkins, lexi tenney, aly rumpanos, matt starkey, isais dolores, ashlee dominguez, kassie dogherra, ben fisher, jaime sanchez, ashley sanders, scott glass, dan.. um.. something, maddie flood, valerie getts, roxy rafi-tarie, elena jin and michele chelman.   anyway, weï¿½re all sitting waiting for jocelyn zimniki to arrive at the airport.  now dont get me wrong, jocelynï¿½s one of the coolest people i noe, but at this point we are all a little angry at her.   she shows up and checkï¿½s in and before you noe it weï¿½re on the plane, sweeping off the ground. daredevil played on screen and some of the kids (mikaela) watched it in espanol. ha ha. we ate fruit, took pics and when they turned the fasten seat belt sign off we got up and PARTIED! seriously, the walkways were crowded with kids.   it was crazy! we swapped CDs, played cards, read magazines, desiree cuneo (who i sat next to) even broke her chair.. you noe, the normal stuff. (i was also sitting next to teena.)   when the movie ended a blooper/comedy show came on and then NBC was up after that. lexi sat behind me and we were listening to the grease soundtrack, cause she played Cha-Cha in a play. ï¿½itï¿½s raining on prom niight!ï¿½ i brought that CD just for her.   uh oh! we hit turbulence half way into the flight. the second time we all were rushed to our seats. teena ended up with Maya and Matt behind me, and Maddie was next to me. Des still stayed by the window.   we still swapped CDs, and my graduation mix made elena and mikaela cry. aww. i was having tons of fun and we werent even in DC yet! des shuffled cards while maddie fiddled with the air vents.   the stewardess came around with soda. one ginger ale please. maddie and i took turns throwing pretzels at each other :-D.   the captian turned the sign off and we all moved around. Matt ended up sitting next to me. Des was figuring out her new digital camera, and matt played his gameboy.   weï¿½ve landed at our gate, D16, in the Dulles airport. just imagine, 5 hours ago we left gate C2 at San Jose. I wonder if anyone got there bag sent to Cuba.. ha ha.matt and i had the same time on our watches.. and miki said something about making out with her cheek..? oo yeah, those blanket that had been touched by naked bodies!   we got our bags and yummy candy and then we stepped out into the humidity of the East Coast. it was a relief when our ACï¿½d bus drove up.   We drove passed some famous sites, the Potomac, the Washington Monument, Smithsonian, White House, Federal Reserve and the Department of the Interior (donï¿½t ask...)   There was a parade in front of the White House. lots of military vehicles and what not.  we passed more sites, a car being towed, a bus of old people, American History Musuem, the National Achives and the IRS!!   Starkey made a funny quote ï¿½Some people are smart, some people are not...ï¿½   our chaperones for the trip were Mrs. Chavez, her son and daughter: Mike and... um... the daughter. and also our librarian, Gayle Rorvick! Sheï¿½s really cool.   we drove into Union Station and peered at the top of the building. Fire, Electricity, Freedom, Knowlegde, Agriculture and Mechcanics. all things that helped man evolve from the primitive beast he once was.   we j-walked to the train station, where we found a REALLY COOL food court. we bought pizza and talked about how Nathalie got hit on!! by an old guy!! thatï¿½s when i first met nathalie. well.. not first met, but first had a real conversation with.  Nathalie and and I got gelato ice cream. mm. and then i bought a pint of lemon ice cream for our room. Ahh! Mrs. Chavez said it would melt before we got back. we had to eat it super duper fast. I ate with Matt, Kassie, Nathalie, Janis, Teena and Aaron, but left to go shopping with Jessica and Amanda. I took the ice cream with me :-D.   We looked at books and finished the ice cream. we even saw a really cool train! we met up with Aaron, Matt, Kassie and Teena on the way out. Jessie said sheï¿½d she me on the bus and Matt was like ï¿½or in hell!ï¿½ Then Kassie and I walked back to the bus taking pictures along the way.   on the bus we sang ï¿½Baby Got Backï¿½ and then our tour with Hopi got under way. We drove to the Jefferson Memorial and i got some cute pics of Miki, Elena, Elena and Lexi. there was a really big ledge too.. Jocelyn almost walked off it.   then we headed to the to the Roosevelt Memorial. Hopi (our tour guide) asked ï¿½do we need a bathroom break?ï¿½, Jaime yelled ï¿½NO! We got cups!ï¿½ and then Miki was like ï¿½Not all of us are like Kevin..ï¿½   the FDR memorial was really cool. there were a bunch of waterfalls and we got a bunch of photos. it was really hot tho.. if i stayed outside any longer i wouldï¿½ve friend like bacon. Matt said the Washington Monument looked possesed.. and then he said sweat was good hair gel. lol.   iï¿½ve known matt since preschool.. more or less. he was friends with my cousin Kalie. his mom knew her grandma or something... yeah.. anyway, he was prolly my first best friend.   anyway, there was a bunch of rain and lightning. rorvick and i were gettinï¿½ pretty freaked out.. Matt said a bunch of things ï¿½Guys take showers so they donï¿½t smell worse,ï¿½ and ï¿½Maybe we could hit the guy who didnt make a california avenue.ï¿½   we went to a supermarket to buy stuff for our room. in line, Matt, Aaron and I stood behind a drunk guy in a dress! he was buyinï¿½ Burban! lol. then we got back on the bus and it started to pour like never before.   when we got to the hotel, Karen checked us in and we went to our lucky room. 509!! Mike came by and gave matt his medicine, and then we got ice to chill our drinks.   Kassie and Teena and Ashlee came up to see us when this creepy old man came over and said ï¿½I will not tolerate loudness, I have two 8 year olds in a bed and I will not have you waking them out. One loud noise and *snap* Iï¿½ll call the front desk and youï¿½re outta here.ï¿½   we spent the rest of the night talking to everyone on the phone.   some hot gossip?   Tessa, Kate and Cerena got a security gaurd assigned right outside their door.  Des Cuneo, Nathalie and their room buddie have a fridge! They said we could store stuff in it...  Kassie, Teena and Ashlee got their phones disconnected!   kassie came up to get ice and i saw tape on our door and thought mike had sealed it, but he didnt and anyway, teena sealed it and we got ready for bed. Mike came to tuck us in and thatï¿½s when we found out he hadnï¿½t put the tape on! he talked to us about tomorrow and about our ï¿½traumatizingï¿½ run-in with the old red neck.   everyone went to bed and i stayed up, in the bathtub, writing in my journal.    Day 2    we ended up talking until 2 the night before. the red neck was banging against our wall, but we werenï¿½t being loud.. lol.. in the morning we woke up, showered, and went down to breakfast. I had eggs and cereal.   then we walked to the lobby and found a handicapped bathroom! it was so cool! it opened by itself!! and then we rode the escalators. then on bus, we heard about how elena rossman ran into her closet mirror because she thought it was open.   elena is awesome! iï¿½ve known her since 5th grade... maybe longer.. yeah , i think longer. but anyway, shes really nice and fun and friendly. one time i threw a phone book at her and it hit hurt in the head. i bought her candy though! lol..   we headed to the Veitnam Memorial and we all got carnations to put out for soilders. our first stop was the Korean War memorial. 19 soilders lined up on the tundra. next we visted the Veitname Memorial, with 58,226 names cast in stone, the place felt lonely. empty. names. all names.   i left a carnation under Micheal A. Walterï¿½s grave thinking he might be related to Cooper... that kid is so perverted.   anyway, we walked to the Einstein statue and took pictures. there was a rumor that if you touch his nose, you will get smarter. i touced it... twice... just in case. we got back on the bus. woo, that AC relieved me. oh yeah.. miki is goldylocks.. and janis is a hyena? i dunno, those two are crazy. Hopi had a bunch of sweat stains on her butt... lol..   George Pataki and Chris Cox. New York Senator and California Representative. I met them both! We got out of the bus and headed to the front of the Supreme Court building. thats the judical branch. these hairy guys came up to us.. i think they were making fun of people who wore fur cause they were dressed like cave men.   anyway, we took pictures and i told tessa that her family had come to resuce her from civilization. ï¿½Smile and say FAMILY REUNION!ï¿½ yeah.. you had to be there...   then we went to the Library of Congress. there was a naked statue of Neptune in the front. with a 9 incher! Inside the library we saw a bunch of books and there was a really cool zodiac floor! Nathalie and I love it! There was even the first book ever printed!   we walked to the capitol building and I met Chris Cox from New Port Beach! He shook my hand! It made my day. we went in the building and we saw TONS of priceless artwork. it was amazing. De Soto, Columbus, The Pilgrims, Pocahontas, The Declaration, Saratoga and Yorktown were some of the paintings.   we also saw a bunch of statues and learned a lot about the capitol. then we met george pataki. on the capitol building lawn, there was a protest. ï¿½Circumcision is wrong! The foreskin is not a birth defect!ï¿½ boy, that prolly made the jewish boys behind us very happy. oo! alec is jewish!   yeah, back to story. oh we went to McDonalds next and we have to eat EVERYTHING we bought. I ended up eating everything everyone else didnt want too.. Fries, Milkshakes, McNuggest (Nathalie calls them ï¿½Muggetsï¿½) and more fries. i left them a souvenior the janitor will never forget. Kassie said ï¿½we should take a picture of the fries!ï¿½ and kate was like ï¿½just look in the toilet tomorrow!ï¿½   Next we stopped at the White House visitor center. I picked p some stuff for Mr. Sullivan AND! i got a coloring book! yay! we walked back to the bus and stopped at the White House. I got a stick from the lawn! it was really cool. and i saw the West Wing! That is a really good show...! there were a lot of squrriels too.. we walked past Alexander Hamilton and the Treasury Building and we even saw a monument to General Sherman! it reminded me of Gone with the Wind.   we then went to the Holocaust Museum and watched a story about a boy named Daniel. it was really sad. there was even a little walk through thing and Lisa V. was my partner. Lisa is really cool.. and really nice too.   then we went to the old post office and went up a glass elavator. it was ok, the veiw was kinda weird, but hey, i had Kevin grassadoniaï¿½s booty scrunched close to me for most of it, so it was great. coming down the elevator, teena scared me to death. we left the old post office and headed to..   THE INTERNATIONAL SPY MUSEUM! way lamer than it sounds... i got a cool shirt tho. and i beat kevin g. a lot though at this weird game. ha ha i won. we got to climb through an air duct too! it got really boring.. but then there was this thing where you could see ur house on a satelitte! it was awesome! i bought a sweet t-shirt that says ï¿½Deny Everythingï¿½ yay!   it started to rain and we got back on the bus. soon we stopped at a pizza place. matt got cheese poured in his hair and i made kassie laugh by saying ï¿½Cheese Meï¿½ when the waiter came around. Well we headed to the Lincoln memorial after that. we took a bunch of pictures and learned a lot about old Abe. He was really tall...   we went shopping at this little place with a bunch of street vendors and the rain began to pour. we got back on the bus and headed to the Kennedy Center for Fine Arts. there were flags from every nation except Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Cuba and North Korea. we also got to see into an opera and we saw a hall of states. then we went up a balcony and took pic.   Next, we drove to the Iwo Jima memorial, where Janis and I were the tour guides. fun stuff. we took a bunch of pictures of the six soilders raising the flag and then we just wanted to go home and sleep.   when we got to the hotel, Janis and I used the phones to try and call Ellen. it as busy, but we met these 2 girls and janis gave them her room number. When i got to my room, the door was open and Aaron and Matt were gone, probably getting ice. Lexi and Elena called and told us to go downstairs to a party.   we brought candy and soda and MM they had cheez-its. we also got to raid Mrs. Chavezï¿½s room and get free food. then we went back to our rooms and tried to get to sleep. but instead we ended up talking until three. we were really tired in the morning.    Day 3    FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!!   today was the trip to Arlington national cemetery. after a quick breakfast we were taken into a world of sad sculptures and gravestones. we visited the eternal flame and the tomb of the unknown solider. the hike was a long one, but the changing of the guards was.. for the most part... worth it. it was kinda dramatic.. but itï¿½s to honor the dead so i guess its ok. i liked it.   all in all arlington was good. after the cemetary, we headed for the washington monument. we rode the elevator to the top. well, the 100 floor. the look down was 500 feet! it was really cool, we got to see so much! after the monument we walked to the Smithsonian where we said ï¿½Alohaï¿½ to our tour guide.   we got to travel around the ï¿½Mallï¿½ which is the term used for the block on which the Smithsonian museums sit. We breaked and picked buddies. Ashlee and I headed for the Natural history museum and headed all the way down to the food court. we got soo much food!   iï¿½ve known ashlee since kindergarten..? yeah, sheï¿½s really cool and funny. and she likes to read a lot, so if i ever read a book then her and i can have discussions about it.. its funner than you think :-D   anyway, after we looked at a bunch of gems and the Hope Diamond. 52.27 karat from India. there were a lot of crystals and stuff and i got a sweatshirt from the american history museum. we went across the street and walked down to the art museum. we bought a few bottles of soda. we took pictures in front of a fountain and then went into the air and space museum. thats where we met up with Janis, Nat, Valerie, Ashley and Lisa.  Nathalie and I ditched Janis and Ashlee and hid behind a fence thing that we thought was tinted (we can see out but they cant see in) Janis and Ashlee were walking aroundon the floor below. suddenly they look up at us and wave. Nathalie screams ï¿½I THOUGHT THEY COULDNï¿½T SEE IN!ï¿½   we continued walking and we got in a WW2 plane! how fuun!! we checked out some rooms with planets in them and we looked at some space shuttles too.   at five we met matt, ben, aaron, janis, ashlee and everyone else in front of the museum. it was scorching hot but the bus came soon and we drove to the Department of Printing and Engraving. we saw moola being made and we checked out the gift shop.  on the ceiling there were motion censors, and my head almost set them off.   after the money place we drove outta DC. we drove to virgina and stopped at the pentagon mall where we went shopping! ee! ashley sarah and I went to abercrombie and then vikiï¿½s. it was so much fun! they had really cute undies in fcuk. then we went back to the bus, running through the rain to get to it.   back at the hotel, we all got dressed in our bathing suits and went down to the pool. i sat outside and wrote in my notebook since the rain had died down. i walked with elena back to the lobby but i realized i had forgotten my key. we went to the front desk to ask for another one, but they wouldnt make one for me.   teena walked me back to the pool and we got aarons key. i went into the elevator and teena said ï¿½be right back.ï¿½ so i held the elevator and this guy came in and was like ï¿½going up?ï¿½ and i was all ï¿½yep..ï¿½ and then a while later he got out and teena came back and got in and he was like ï¿½going up?ï¿½ and she was like ï¿½sorry.ï¿½ by the time i got back to the 4th floor, elena was done showering and we all hung out. it was another hall party! i went in kevinï¿½s room and we talked and yeah, it was fun.   i ran back up to my room and slipped a note under the door for aaron and matt. i also brought candy downstairs. the hall party was gettinï¿½ hot and i ran back to my room to get soda right when matt and aaron got back. matt and aaron went down to the party but at 10 we had to get back to our rooms and tuck in.    Day 4    that night we packed and packed and after we had cleaned our rooms we watched drew carey. i fell asleep tho and i slept like a log... or maybe a rock... i would say a baby but i guess babies dont sleep super well. oh yeah! that night i got a call from my mom and thats when i found out she was PREGNANT! the babyï¿½s due February 16th! see ya all at the baby shower :-D!   anyway, the next day we woke up late and i brought a soda down for breakfast. when we were in the lounge i opened the soda and it SPRAYED all over me. i went up to my rooom and changed, and headed back to breakfast, but then kassie ran into me with a plate of eggs.. so i showered and changed again.   then matt came up to the room and we all brought our luggage down to the bus. wihtin a few hours the bus was moving and we had left virgina for good. we watched night at the roxburry and nathalie, matt and i laughed SO HARD! kassie slept in the hallway. crazy. but anyway, i fell asleep during the movie, but nathalie and mattï¿½s talking woke me up.   after the movie we made a pit stop in Delaware. i missed Maryland! we took a bunch of pictures in front of the ï¿½Big Guy Restrauntï¿½ statue. when we got back on the bus we drove to New Jersey while watching Orange County. I love that movie! We laughed so hard. after the movie we were on the border of New Jersey and after we went through a tunnel we ended up in Manhattan, New York!!   we finally made it! we stopped at our hotel and dropped off our bags. our tour guide arrived at the new york part of the tour started. first stop: Texas and Texas for lunch! after that we bought some stuff from the local street vendors and we spent most of our time walking around and looking at the sights.   we bought some shirts and then we walked to radio city music hall and then to the donald trumpt building. thats when we went in to take a tour of NBC studios. it was a lot of fun and we saw the SNL set and even some previews for Will and Grace! i bought a will and grace shirt from the gift shop.   we headed back to the hotel and the rain started to pour. my bag started to rip and right when we got in the door it fell apart. woot woot. we went upstairs and all got fabbed up. we looked so perfect and we walked to Chiliï¿½s in our formal wear. i had this cute brown american eagle umbrella!   anyway, at chiliï¿½s we all sat around and talked. ashley sanders and i danced to genie in a bottle, the spanish version. then we walked to the New Amsterdam theater. we got into the Lion King and everything was goregous. the play was beautiful and at the end i cried. it was amazing.   we walkd to times square after the play. i made some jokes about the hookers and then we all got together and took a picture. on the way we saw lisa leslie from the sparks, and before the picture we saw chopper!! he was really cute, and nathalie got a hug! there were a bunch of pigeons.. ee.. i hate birds.. anyway, the picture was good but i look shitty so, no, im not showing you.   we walked back and saw billy joel!! ï¿½we didnt start the fire!ï¿½ thatï¿½s like mr. sullivanï¿½s favorite song. anyway, we got back to the hotel and we watch SNL before going to sleep.

      As we go on, we remember  All the times we had together  And as our lives change, from whatever  We will still be friends forever. -Vitamin C, "Graduation"     the summer was a new beginning. no, no, june was a new beginning. the days leading up to the last day were crazy. we had to get all our work back, and I even got a letter from 5th grade.   it started with bonnie and ili. they were the first people I told. that I liked guys. It was scary at first, but after it felt really good. like masterbating for the first time. okï¿½ that was a little too much. :-) so what started as small got bigger and bigger. graduation practices and.. lol.. joel marshall.. filled my thoughts for the last days. suddenly it was grad. night. everything seemed so perfectï¿½ except Mrs. Zahrobskyï¿½s fucked up balloon arch. well yeah it was beautiful.   and the dance was way awesome. the theme was Hollywood, and boy was it a night with the stars. I told a bunch of people that I was.. wellï¿½ you noe the word. The night was ending.. tears were falling.. and dances were being danced. Shout outs to des cuneo, lexi!, mikki, maddie, amanda and naomi for havinï¿½ fun with me on the dance floor.   the night ended, and janis and I ran around givinï¿½ everyone hugs and saying our last goodbyes. I still remember elena rossman asking me for a hug even though she knew we would see each other the next day. You noe I never really realized how much I was gonna miss these people until after they were out of my life. But you cant live in the past forever.   I dropped Janis at home, promising to call her before I picked her up the next day. And then I went home and passed out on my bed. it was over. middle school was over. it was finally over.
