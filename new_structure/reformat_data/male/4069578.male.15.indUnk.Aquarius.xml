       see i wanna talk to megan and harrison about this crap but i just dont have the courage....i think maybe i'm afraid of gettin in some big even more depressing discussion and i'll end up losing them both....things are already tough as hell on megan...and harrison is just so happy that he gets to hug on megan and be with megan.....i think back to that night when JT confronted me and megan said she couldn't be in a relationship.....i remember saying something like "well i guess this means we cant hold hands anymore..........but can i atleast still hug you?" and megans answer to that question was not no...but yes.......i dont think we ever did hold hands after that...infact i think we got even closer after that.....sure megan i did want to continue becuz i was crazy about you but you didn't really put up a fight.....well i was just IMed by harrison......i told about the blog....this post is the only thing standing in my way from  something ...not sure wut that something is though...meh...i can see it now....everything is gonna end...everybody is gonna hate me......*sigh* i dont want to type anymore.....i'm just gonna publish this damn thing and get it over with.....

       AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGG!!! ;_; for some odd reason i feel really sad right now...i'm not sure why...i just dont want to think anymore....my friend crystal has told me to just forget about megan...but its so hard....when i've been focusing on her and only her for such a long time.....i read harrisons journal thingy and he says its like megan was just waiting for him......WUT THE?! wut the hell am i man?!? just a friggin pawn in yalls little chess game of love from hell (wut a name huh? but its not important x_x)....i've known harrison for a long long time and he's a good guy but to me he seems to be acting like a real bastard and that doesn't make me feel good at all.....i dont want to lose megan or harrison as friends but wut other choice do i got?....i just dont know.....i could try to stay friends with them and be miserable cuz i'm too much of an idiot and an asshole to talk to them about it.....or i could make new friends and hang out with different ppl...that way they wouldn't be on my mind as much.....thomas says i should talk to megan and harrison but crystal says i should just let it go...and i want to talk to shara about it cuz she is a very very wise person and i feel i can talk to her about it.......DAMN!! why wont everything just leave me alone?!?.....i feel so bad......wut did i do to deserve this?? AM I SUPPOSED TO GET USED TO THIS?!?!?!? i suppose i sound like a complete bastard..only thinkin of myself.....but then again i dont know....maybe i'm not being selfish.....harrison has said in his journal that he repects ppl blah blah blah.......if only he knew....during the summer i considered harrison my best friend.....it reminds me of that song where the dude is like "shes my best friends girl and she used to be mine".....wut kind of a friend goes out with his buddy's ex?!? even my guitar teacher had some comments...he was like "hmm well who's your real friend?"....something for me to think about....now i'm thinkin about the thing "wuts harrison got that i dont got???".....well i'm not smart like harrison is.....i really have difficulties putting my emotions into words...but just becuz i have a hard time puttings my emotions into words doesn't mean i dont have emotions.....i think of myself as a really sensitive person....harrison and megan are having some tough stuff with religion....so am i....i believe that there is a god...i would love to say that i have faith like harrison does....but it brings tears to my eyes becuz i cant say that i can....its such a horrible feeling.....my mom is a strong Christian.....as for my dad well he doesn't goto church...i dont know his views on the subject and it makes me feel horrible....and this blog makes me think that all i care about is me, me, me, and me......but thats wrong.....i care for all of my friends.....i dont like to hurt anybody unless they hurt me...and usually i never get payback.......and now i'm just beatin myself up..but i cant help it.....its just so hard....i dont think anybody knows wut i feel like...but that cant be true becuz somebody has to...thats just how it is.....and i dont want to end up like megan with (yes i am quoting this from harrison) "excess emotional baggage" but i just dont know how things are gonna turn out......i dont wanna think anymore....i just dont know......i feel pain and anger...i feel like i'm not good enough...i feel like everybody is gonna end up hating me in the end...i just feel a whole bunch of things...and i dont like it.....i dont like how harrison says "it's MEGAAAAN!!!" over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.....i dont like it....ever since they've been together harrison just seems so full of himself....WELL LET ME TELL YOU....i think megan is gonna leave him out in the cold someday....and i dont think megan is gonna convert into a Christian.......HARRISON! MEGAN! IF YOU TWO ARE READING THIS THEN BLEH!!! if yall are reading this then i would imagine that megan hates my guts now...and i would imagine that harrison isn't too pleased.....i'm gonna stop here...i'll probably think of some more shizz later that i would  want to add to this post but it would be a waste of time....um yeah....

        hmm alrighty then.....this be meh blog thingy.......at first i was just gonna make it so i could show everyone how pissed off i am but i decided that i can put wutever i want here.....wutever i feel like saying.....my feelings.....my actions....goodies of all kinds....you maybe wondering why i am pissed......well i guess i'll tell ya.....i'm pissed of at harrison and megan......seems to me like they both stabbed me in the back......harrison supported megan and i....then he stabbed me in the back..cuz he wants her now....but he said he didn't want her becuz of religious stuff....nah..that aint how it looks to me.....and then there's megan....i really do think she was leading me on for some time...but she denies it...saying that i was the one that wanted to continue....i did want to continue but if she didn't want to continue then i think she should have done a little bit more to try to shake me off.....i thinki've got afew questions for her...why didn't you tell me that you wanted to be with harrison? when did you decide that you wanted to be with harrison?......maybe some more...i'll be thinkin about it....i know that you said that it's not about who is better but sometimes i wonder..wut's harrison got that i dont?!?....i dunno.....i'm not depressed about it anymore...just angry.....i can imagine that there are a few things that i'm overlooking but i'm pretty sure that i have put a lot of thought into this stuff.........heh i bet if yall are readin this yall are prolly thinkin somethin like "WHOA! wut an asshole!!" well if thats wut i am then thats wut i am..........y'know normally i dont like to make ppl uncomfortable if i have anything to do about it......but lemme tell ya.....somehow it feels so good to be really really angry after a long time of just not being very mad......i dont want megan as more than a friend anymore....she can have harrison i suppose.....i dont want to lose anybody as a friend..but if they read this i dont know how they is gonna take it......heh even my guitar teacher has given me wise words about this stuff.....heh heh i think this make it sound like i'm weird but i read harrison and megans "online journal" thingies......i read harrisons and i sense fault....familiar feelings too.......i read megans and from the sound of it it seems like megan to me.....she has reallystrong feelings...i mean like...they're deep....i dunno....i'm not smart like harrison is....sometimes i have trouble saying wuts on my mind......but harrison may be wise but i'm wise too....i'm not an idiot....bleh..........school is starting soon.....i know school is evil but i look at it this way...wut would we do without school?....there's gonna be new ppl at school.....its gonna be awesome...i look forward to it actually...heh i know i'm probably gonna change my view on that when school starts though..........well i think i would post more but my head hurts so i'm gonna go lie down......if anybody wants to talk to me about this stuff (i bet if you read it you will want to talk to me...) then just IM me...its all good....my good my good...not my bad....my good....
