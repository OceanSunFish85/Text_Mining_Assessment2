      Ok, this is very cool. AISO GrepLaw, Detritus as set up a âSonny Bono is Deadâ site, collecting samples from the works that would have passed into the public domain, but for the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.  Sonny Bono, I am told, was a sweet man and great friend. Iâm sure thatâs true, and his untimely death certainly robbed the world of the very best of this man. Itâs therefore very sad that the worst of Sonny Bono continues to echo â this indiscriminate extension of copyrights. Congresswoman Mary Bono had some great ideas about how to make Congresswoman Lofgrenâs Public Domain Enhancement Act âbetter,â as she put it. Is there a possible Sonny Bono Public Domain Act in the works?
