						   In the Idaho National Guard we are often told to "be Gumby," or to be incredibly flexible.  Well this last weekend we all practiced our Gumby skills once again as we packed our section equipment and our personal equipment to meet us in Fort Bliss.  The packing of the equipment is not a big deal, you pack up your duffel bags, through them in a pile, and pack up your section equipment in a big box.  My section, the Medic section, has very little in the way of equipment.  Especially when compared to other sections, such as the mechanics.  No, the true test of our Gumbiness came when we were told that rather than leaving on 1 July we were leaving on 3 July.  Why is that a problem?  What trauma could that possibly cause by telling us that we have an extra 2 days to spend with our loved ones?  There is, as so often happens, more to the story than that. Over the course of our "2 weeks in the summer" training we were told often and LOUDLY that if there was any information to be told, we would be among the first to know.  Essentially the leadership, specifically the commander and first sergeant, said that media was not "in the know" and should information become available, we would be told by our chain of command.  The media was not a good source of information as far as our deployment goes.  So, more than a week ago, the newspaper reported that the unit would be leaving on 3 July to head to Fort Bliss to start training.  We all knew that the paper couldn't be right, since that information hadn't come down to us through the proper channels.  In light of this, when one soldiers mother asked if she should get her ticket for vacation for a date after 3 July, that soldier said "No, don't waste your vacation time just because the newspaper screwed up on the date."  Her concern was to be able to see her son off as he flew out.  Fast forward from then to this last weekend, and on Sunday afternoon, after spending the whole weekend working with the very people that knew all of the correct details, they finally decided that it was important enough to let the rest of us in on it.   Being Gumby gets REALLY frustrating REALLY fast.

						   This is, as you can see, the first entry in what I hope will be fairly regular updates to my weblog.  It made sense to me, as I don't know how much time I will have once my unit gets activated to send out letters and/or emails to everyone that I would like to.  This will serve as a forum for people to get a glimpse into life as it unfolds throughout the deployment.  As it stands now, on 8 June, 2004, we are all anxiously waiting out Mobilization date of 1 July.  On that date my unit will move from Lewiston, Idaho to Fort Bliss, Texas.  For those of you who are not familiar with Fort Bliss (as I wasn't), it is located near El Paso, Texas, which is also very near the New Mexico border.  We will not, however, be spending much time on Fort Bliss itself.  Instead, the training sites are 60-70 miles out, and consists of three separate sites, each with a different focus.  Each site is a 10 day training circuit, with 3 days in between sites for movement to the next site and rest.  From what I understand it will be some long days.  After Fort Bliss, the unit will attend 1 of 2 training bases: Fort Irwin, California or Fort Polk, Louisiana.  I have spent time at both (4 years at Polk and 2 months at Irwin) and each has it's own ups and downs.  After spending a month training there, rumor has it that we will receive leave prior to deployment overseas to Iraq.  Spirits in the unit itself have remained pretty high, but then no one can say how that may change once the shit hits the fan, as it were.  I do have every confidence in myself and my comrades, and this training that we will be attending will only enhance that.  My section, the Medics, will even be receiving extra training for our medical skills.  That is very exciting in itself and I am looking forward to brushing up a bit.   As it stands, I do not know when things will change, or when I will have time to enter again post-mobilization.  I don't imagine that there will be internet access at Fort Bliss, nor the time to utilize it.  I will make every effort, however, to update this blog frequently.

						   Now that I have time to add more, I will. Fortunately for me I had the presence of mind to start writing down what was going on for most of the time in training for just such an occassion.  3 Jul 04 - We arrived in El Paso. The flight was very nice, the stewards were friendly and courteous to all of us. Prior to getting on the plane was a lot of tears and hugging. I wouldn't wish that day on anyone.   4 Jul 04 - The food at the basecamp (Dona Ana, outside of Fort Bliss, TX) is dismal, but on par with Army chow. This day consisted of a line that lasted for 8 hours to spend 5 minutes at the front getting an ID card. Luckily for us most of the wait was indoors with rows and rows of chairs and desks. On the other hand, we didn't know that we would be sitting for so long and didn't bring anything to do.   5 Jul 04 - This was a "down day" which translates into "we have nothing to do, so look busy." We sat around the barracks all day. The barracks are fairly nice, good air conditioning and new beds. I have spent time in worse places.  6 Jul 04 - Woke up at 5:30 and had a road march with our body armor on. Imagine going for a walk, in long pants and long sleeve shirt, then throw on 50lbs. more gear. Later we were trained in identifying and reacting to UXO (unexploded ordinance) and IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices, a big killer in Iraq). I gave a class on identifying and treating heat injuries.  7 Jul 04 - Dad's B-day! We attended mandatory briefings - that means sitting through 8 hours of stuff we had heard at least twice before. Again, not so bad, since there was air conditioning.   8 Jul 04 - Another "down day," which again we had to look busy.  9 Jul 04 - Red letter day! We did our SRP (soldier readiness packet) which consists of making sure you are up to date on your home of record, next of kin, life insurance, legal matters (marriages, births, divorces, powers of attorney) and of course MEDICAL! Everyones favorite, since that is where we get poked like little experimental monkeys. I got 6 different things: PPD (TB test), my first Anthrax shot (1 of a 6 shot series), Small Pox (turns into a nasty little bugger and made me feel very ill by about day 9), Typhoid, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), and a Hepatitis B shot. We were treated with a trip to the PX (Post eXchange, think Walmart with higher quality stuff and no sales tax) for our troubles.  10 Jul 04 - Went to CIF (Central Issue Facility) where we were issued our DCU's (Desert Camouflage Uniform) to include boots, Goretex jacket and pants, hats, and the uniforms themselves. It is always fun to get new stuff! The downside is having to break in new boots.  11 Jul 04 - I have something written down here that for the life of me, I can't remember what it is. So here is a joke: If someone speaks three languages they are called trilingual, someone that speakstwolanguages is called bilingual. So what is someone that speaks one language called? American.  12 Jul 04 - Had to go into Fort Bliss and drive in some vehicles. Managed to stop by the PX again...hard to resist when they have a food court.  13 Jul 04 - Oh yeah, this day. Well, we (medics) were tasked to support a range where some soldiers were zeroing their weapons. The thing is, the active duty component on Bliss is sending out Medics in ambulances to cover all our training. We knew this (since we had found out the hard way 2 days in a row) and told the commander as much. She said to go anyways, since we couldn't assume that they would be there. Long story short, we went, they came, we left. WASTE of a day all because our commander didn't want to listen to us. But hey, I did manage to make it to the PX again!  14, 15, 16 Jul 04 - This is where I forgot to write stuff down. I can't remember what we did. Probably wasn't important.  17 Jul 04 - Look at that! Another trip to the PX!  18 Jul 04 - Media awareness class. This is the Army's way of saying "If you can't say something nice in front of the camera, don't say anything at all." An interesting class, but I felt like hell because of the small pox shot. I had flu symptoms associated with the shot. Nothing like having a fever in the heat of the southwest and having to wear all that gear (50lbs., remember?).  19 Jul 04 - This amounted to a down day, which I needed for some recovery. I felt much better but still not quite up to snuff, what what?  20 Jul 04 - The PA (Physicians Assistant) at the TMC (Troop Medical Clinic) gave us a class on the signs and symptoms of the Flu, Cold, and Sinusitis. A very good class, and perfect for me since my sinuses were killing me.   21 Jul 04 - A day at the range. I must have sweat my body weight this day. The guy in front of me that was trying to zero his weapon couldn't shoot for shit. As a result, I had to stand in the HOT sun for hours and hours. He must have gone through 50 rounds of ammunition. They finally pulled him off to let me shoot. I was done in 12 rounds. From there we went to the SRM (Short Range Marksmanship) range. This would have been fun, but my head was killing me. I would have thought it would occur to me that it was my sinuses (which I discovered later) but I had sweat so much I thought it was dehydration. Brilliant, can't even properly diagnose myself.   22 Jul 04 - Today we did Land Navigation and PLGR training. A PLGR (pronounced "plugger") is a military GPS (global positioning system, using satellites to tell you where you are)unit that was the cutting edge of GPS technology 10 years ago. Since that time, they have gotten as small as a cellular phone, but the Army still uses the PLGR, which isseveral times that size. It was still good training, and a perfect day for it. Not too hot, a nice breeze. We were the first group to finish. Then we had to go and administer the second shot in the Anthrax series to some people. Nothing is as much fun as poking people with needles.   23, 24 Jul 04 - Again, forgot to write anything down.  25 Jul 04 - So there I was, doing laundry in the laundry room. I needed to go use the latrine so I grabbed my helmet and headed out. On the way the First Sergeant (highest ranking enlisted person) saw me and yelled to me. I thought I was in trouble for not having my gear on. As a matter of fact, the first thing he asked me was "Where is your gear?" So I thought I was in trouble. He put his arm around me and said come with me. Then he dropped the hammer. "Your Grandfather died." Life's little curve ball. I responded by jumping away and saying "What!?!" The next part was actually kind of funny looking back on it. He looked at the Red Cross message and showed me and said "This is you, right?" You would think that would have been all verified by the time he told me, huh? Well, it was, I don't know what the hell he was doing. So, the Army flew me home the next day on Emergency Leave for 12 days, free of charge.  26 Jul 04 - LONG flight, crappy layovers, didn't get in until midnight. Still, nice to be home and see my girlfriend and the puppies.  27 Jul 04 - Grampa's viewing is tommorrow, and the funeral is the next day. I am a pall bearer. I have been a pall bearer for each of my grandparents that have passed, all within the last ten years. I am quite sure I will cry my heart out, since we were pretty close. No shame there. I wish he would have known I was going to Iraq before he went. Nothing to be done about it, though. I will put in an extra set of dogtags in with him.He is a WWII vet that I am very proud of, so he will undestand the gesture. He went peacefully after a walk in the morning. He had struggled with congestive heart failure for a couple of years now, and we had struggled with his failing eyesight and hearing for much longer. Still, hard to imagine the man that used to take me and my brother fishing and camping is being returned to the earth.  I had hopes that he would hang on at least until I came back from Iraq.

						   So here I am in Fort Bliss and it is hot hot HOT.  I don't get much internet (this is the first time) so I will make this short.  We have done some training, but real training doesn't start until late July.  Temps reach near 100 every day, and we have to wear about 50 pounds of gear.  We are treated pretty well, and the barracks we stay in are actually alright.  The air conditioning works, so no complaints there.  There is a level of frustration with the amount of flexibility we are supposed to have, but please refer to "Being Gumby."  We finished getting new uniforms (desert, duh) and have gotten cleared through medical.  Of course, clearing through medical meant 6 shots for me, including anthrax and small pox.  None of them hurt much, so it is all good.  That small pox is poxing up really nice, which is disgusting.  It is like a massive whitehead on my shoulder.  It should be healed fairly soon, though.  On a personal note, if anyone emails me, please use my military address.  I cannot check my Yahoo! from this computer, so who knows how it will be when we get "in-country."  I will write more as I can, and I am keeping a bit of a log so I will more fully update it as the opportunity arises.
