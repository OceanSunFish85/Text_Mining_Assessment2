          Lost And Lonely        By: Jonathan Rickey                          â    What happened to us We used to be so perfect, now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder, did I lose my only?â                             The boy shuts off his CD player and then realizes that he is lost and lonely like the lyrics said. He continues to walk home from a friendâs house. Once he got home he jumped on the couch and fell asleep. While he was asleep he dreamed. He dreamed of a lonely future and he didnât know why. The next morning he woke up and went to his computer and started talking on AOL IM and he told his friend and she said you wonât be lonely. You can think that but ur never lonely. Ur loved ones always are thinking of u. Even ppl that u never really knew but u met in a soccer game are even thinking of you. It may be in the farthest corner of their mind but a little part of them are always thinking of you. He told his friend thankx and got off the internet but never forgot what his friend said. He left his house and went for a walk to a place where all it was peace and quiet and he could think. He sat there and thought and then remembered that no one lives forever. He started crying b/c he thought he was lonely and no one cared. But little did he know ppl care they just express it in ways he doesnât realize. He finally decided to leave and halfway home he saw a house fire. Outside of the house he saw a lady and she was yelling save my son.    He then made the 2 sec decision and thought to himself and told himself he has nothing to live for and nothing to lose. He ran into the burning house and as the flames engulfed the house he continued to fight his way through to the kid. He finally found the kid trapped under some wood from the ceiling. He couldnât lift the wood so he kept trying to lift the wood then he tried pushing it. After a while pushing the wood the kid escaped but he couldnât. He was too tiredâ¦he passed out and then the next thing he saw was a guy in a yellow coat and a mask on and carrying him out. He was saved by a fireman then he was sent to the hospital for 3 rd  degree burns. He awoke to ppl sitting around him and cards and flowers around him. He looked forward and saw his family and friends. Then he went back to sleep and in his dream he did not dream of a lonely life but a fun life with a nice house, wife, kids, and the perfect place to live. He woke up 10 hours later and was covered in a cast for his burns. He had been burned on his legs and his arms but they would go away eventually. But no longer was his life lonely. No longer was he lost. No longer was he sad. Now he was happy and had friends that he realized they truly care for him. On his last day in the hospital the mother of the child he rescued offered him a rewardâ¦ a cash reward. He wouldnât take it.. and told the woman he had already gotten enough. But he didnât tell her what he gotâ¦. He got a clear view of a good life instead of a foggy view where in only from time to time would he be happy. Now this boy has no worries b/c he now knows that everyone cares for everyone.             THE            END
