      A party of people at Exun want to change the exun logo. I ask why? They say because a new logo will give it fresh appeal. I tell them that the logo was changed two years back. They say so what?  Why should the logo be changed? Does microsoft or sun change it's logo every year? No, ofcourse they don't. There's a need to maintain continuity and remain similar. Customers and clients identify with a logo. A logo should represent the brand and mean the brand. It is the true essence of a brand. Signing off Dhruv

      I don't know why but I have nothing to say at all. I'm to full of my own nothingness. It's overwhelming. I feel like a bag of nothing. I'm full of nothingness. You can see that I've got nothing to say as I keep repeating the same thing over and over again. I am so so bored. Now I feel like I'm full of boredom and nothingness. What bothers me isthat this world lacks innovation. People like and appreciate innovation yet there are very few innovative people. It's aninteresting observation.  Also something about these IQ tests.  I gave an IQ tests, randomly filling options without even reading the questions and guess what, I got a score of 106! Without reading a single question! I'm bored so I'm signing off

      Hello humans, Yess-ter-daayyy, was not a great day, tomorrow might be better, if i get marks that are better, which depends on the exam, that i wrote like a clam, i will be filled with joy, when i get my sst marks tomorrow.  90% i shaall not get, cry i shall till i feel not wet! long before the next exam,  to make promises to myself  of doing better,  and of workin like savinay, and still not do as well as him!  C'est un pathetic self composed poem. It describes my mood as sorrowful, and nothing can be closer to the truth. I am totally disappointed with my marks. I shall have to work harder the next time around. I actually thought my exams were going well till my maths exam (the second exam!) That's when disaster struck. I messed things up and that's the reason for this poem.  Now.... My performance seems to be dismal though i did well in science. How come geeks always do so well? Because they're geeks! duh! Okay silly question. How come normal people don't do well? Because they're not geeks! duh! Okay another silly question. Conclusion: I hate geeks! Geeks stay away from this website! I'm planning to put an anti geek filter! I've been working on it for a while. After having expressed my hatred towards geeks I must ask another question. Why must we get our results? Why can't the parliament ban exams, results, geeks, teachers, principals and schools? Okay i know the answer don't mind telling me. S'all for now fellow humans.

      Adsense makes a lot of sense for webmasters like me who have websites that get very little traffic. The fact that you don't have to invest any amount at all is great. Get paid for clicks. It's great. But the only problem seems to be that they have a very tough method of selection. My website didn't get through. They didn't select it, (though the reason is unknown to me and i feel that my website is the site ever made!) I tried some other pay for click ads but none of them got me any money at all. I joined this program (name witheld) where i was to be paid 25 cents per click nd the minimum amount for a cheque was 100 dollars. It took me about 8 months to collect 12 dollars. That was three years ago and i still haven't earnt a hundred dollars. It is wierd. I do hope google is better with their pay outs, though i am in no position to comment on it. I don't see why they have such a tough method of selection. What harm could accepting my website cause to them. It isn't asking too much. Or am I too 'low' for them. It won't cause any negative publicity to them. (My website is harmless. It is JUST about some computer related topics) I'm applying again and do hope that i am selected this time.

      In a dark, cluttered and small room a knock was heard. A lean man about 6 feet of height and 30 years of age walked to the door and pulled it open. "who is it?" he said in a hoarse whisper. "It's me, Brian" came the reply. Brian walked in and seated himself on a table cluttered with books. "What's the progress like?" asked Brian. "It's just about done. I'll finish the rest in about half an hour" "So doomsday is near!" "You could say that if things go according to the POA." "Why do you sound doubtful. It's seems to be easy enough. Just email it in 'harmless' packages" "Emailing a virus isn't that easy, you know." "why not? Just make it an attachment." "There are many problems" "Like anti-virus software, scanners and stuff? I thought you found a way through them?" "As a matter of fact, I did. But I overlooked a seemingly unimportant detail. That is, the internet" "what do you mean" "I mean i've been trying for the past half hour and haven't been able to connect till now. And unless I can connect I can't get through the anti-virus software or the scanners and such."  You see what a barrier the internet has become. Dial-up is a curse on man kind. It's like knowing where heaven is but not being able to go there because it takes too long or you can't get a connection. Though in this case it might have been for the better of mankind in most cases we mere mortals just wish to get some info for our school reports or cheat codes or some info about a shoe or a comp. I think I must stop chattering on and on, so that's all for now, folks!   Note: I'm not obsessed with the internet and it's numerous problems but I do like writing about it.

      Broadband internet is a boon. I got a cable connection last week and it works like a dream(I was using dial-up before that, that explains it doesn't it?) I wanted DSL or ADSL but unfortunately DSL wasn't available in my area and ADSL turns out to expensive for my kinda usage. SO i got cable. Howcome the rates aren't slashed. The rates for ADSL are the same as they were about a year back. Cable has got down by 50%. Dial up is cheap in any case. DSL seems to be pretty affordable though. I do hope costs go down in the near future to get these excellent services in the reach of the common man(hello humans! that's us!)

      I love this! I feel like the whole world is listening to me with bated breath (don't care to tell me you don't care one bit) I recently read something about the menace of camera phones. I don't see what the problem is. Okay okay i see what the problems is but the solution (not given by me, but some brilliant mind) seems to be equally conclusive. The solution is to get a sort of beeper like sound whenever an image is snapped. This sound should be played irrespective of the speaker volume and profile settings and such. Banning these useful devices in public places won't help. We can't expect the cops to start making sure that people aren't using camera phones. It seems a total waste of public funds to me.  That's all. (lets see for how long)

      This is my first post on blogger and i don't seem to have much to say. I plan to post something as often as i can, though it may be of no interest to anyone at all. But it's my right to freedom of expression and i plan to use it. I don't care whether anyone cares to read, listen or reply. This is my birth right and i'm lovin' it! I don't know what impulse led me to call my blog hellohumans, but it seems to be a fairly unique and expressive name, so it should do for me. I've never been to innovative so this is the best i could come up with. Innovation doesn't have much to do with me. That's all for now, fellow humans

      This is the Adsense FAQ. It is immensely long and boring.  1. What is Google AdSense?  Google AdSense is a fast and easy way for website publishers of all sizes to display relevant, unobtrusive Google ads on their website's content pages and earn money. Because the ads are related to what your users are looking for on your site, you'll finally have a way to both monetize and enhance your content pages. It's also a way for web site publishers to provide Google search to their site users, and to earn money by displaying Google ads on the search results pages. Find out more about AdSense for search. The program is free, and Google pays you for valid clicks on the ads on your site or search results pages. So go ahead and try this program. If you comply with our  urlLink program policies , just complete our  urlLink online application  and select either or both of AdSense for content pages and WebSearch plus AdSense. One application gets you approved for both AdSense and WebSearch â you can decide to use any combination of these products on your pages. We'll review your application and follow up with an email within 2-3 days. If you are accepted into the program, you can log in to your new account and get the HTML code to insert into your web pages.  2. How does Google target ads to my website?  Simply put, we provide you with AdSense HTML ad code to place on the web pages on which you want to display Google ads. Then, we take care of the rest by leveraging proprietary Google search and page-ranking technologies to deliver relevant Google ads to those content pages. We go beyond simple keyword matching to understand the context and content of web pages. Based on a sophisticated algorithm that includes such factors as keyword analysis, word frequency, font size, and the overall link structure of the web, we know what a page is about, and can precisely match Google ads to each page Our technology can also determine the primary language of a page. If your content is in English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, or Spanish, AdSense will target ads in the appropriate language to your content. In addition, Google ads are  urlLink geotargeted  to your visitor's location.  3. What makes Google AdSense different from other ad networks?  This innovative new Google business solution will help you unleash the true revenue potential of your site. Here are just some of the advantages of our program: Run ads that will interest your users. Google AdSense delivers easy to read and text and image-based ads targeted to the content of your pages and WebSearch queries. Leverages Google search technology. The proprietary Google search and page-ranking technologies are the foundation for AdSense. We understand the context and content of web pages and precisely match Google ads to your pages. Filter unwanted ads. Google combines an editorial team, filtering technology, and your input to create a robust set of filters that are right for you. Getting started is fast and easy. Getting started with AdSense is easy and requires no engineering resources on your side. We give you a few lines of HTML that you add to any of your web pages. It takes just minutes, after which you'll be serving Google ads on your pages - and generating more advertising revenue.  4. How do I sign up?  To get started with either AdSense for content or WebSearch plus AdSense for Search, all you have to do is check that your site(s) complies with our  urlLink program policies . Then, when you are ready to join our program, just go to the  urlLink Google AdSense home page , and click Click here to apply. Complete and submit your application, and check for an email from us to verify your email address. Once you verify your email address, we'll review your application and follow up with you via email within 2-3 days. If we approve your application, you'll be able to log in to your AdSense account and get started. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  5. How quickly will Google ads start appearing on my site?  After being accepted to the program and successfully pasting the AdSense HTML ad code into your web pages, ads will start running on your site within minutes. If your site is not yet in our index, it may take up to few hours or more before we are able to crawl your site. Until we are able to crawl your site, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Adding the WebSearch code to your pages will instantly generate a WebSearch box. As search results are displayed on Google-hosted pages, relevant ads will appear immediately, if ads are available for the particular query. Publishers have sole responsibility for the operation and maintenance of their sites. Google shall not be responsible in the event that the AdSense HTML ad code is implemented incorrectly or we are technically unable to serve ads on a site.  6. What if I have questions or comments about the program?  We aim to make participation in Google AdSense a seamless process. However, we know we aren't perfect, so if you have questions, just email us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . We are happy to provide you with any help or information that you may need. Also, please don't hesitate to send us your comments. Your feedback is vital to us being able to provide the service that you want. For technical support, you can view our  urlLink technical implementation guidelines  or email  urlLink adsense-tech@google.com .  7. Am I a Business or Individual account?  Business account payments will be made payable to the Company Name, while Individual accounts are paid out to the Payee Name of the account holder. In addition, publishers in the United States will be required to provide a Social Security Number for their Individual accounts, or an Employer Identification Number (EIN) if they've selected a Business account. Thereâs no difference in the services or payment structure between Individual and Business accounts. For more information about EINs, we suggest visiting the IRS website at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98350,00.html . Should you ever need to select a new account type, our specialists will work with you to close your current account and to open a new account with your updated information.  Program Basics   1. How do I start running ads?  If your application is approved, you'll be able to log in to your Google AdSense account with the login information (email address and password) that you submitted with your application. Then you'll be able to copy-and-paste AdSense HTML ad code into your web pages and begin serving ads. If your site is not yet in our index, it may take a few hours or more before we are able to crawl your site and serve the most relevant Google ads. Until we are able to crawl your pages, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Please note that website publishers have sole responsibility for the operation and maintenance of their sites. Google shall not be responsible in the event that our script is implemented incorrectly. However, if you do have trouble, we would like to help in any way we can. You can read our  urlLink technical implementation guidelines  or contact our technical support team at  urlLink adsense-tech@google.com .  2. How do I optimize my site for the most relevant ads?  Our ability to target ads to your site depends on the content and structure of your site. Here are some basic guidelines for optimizing your site: Place ads on pages that predominately contain text -- only text is used to determine a page's context. If you have a robots.txt file, you'll need to remove it or add the following two lines to your robots.txt to allow our content bot to crawl your site: User-agent: Mediapartners-Google* Disallow: If your page contains frames, select the âFramed pageâ checkbox when generating the ad layout code for that page. Place ads on pages that don't require a login. Place ads on content pages that don't change frequently. By following these tips, we can better serve the most relevant Google ads on all of your content pages. If we are unable to crawl or understand the content on your site, we may serve public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings.  3. Can I filter which ads are displayed on my site?  Yes. To create and manage a filter list of websites whose ads you'd like to restrict from showing on your site or WebSearch results pages, simply log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/  and click on the Settings tab. You can create separate filter lists for your content pages and for your WebSearch results pages. Ads for the websites that you add to your URL filter list typically will not run on your pages, but remember that filtering sites may decrease the number of ads that can appear on your pages as well as decrease your potential earnings. We also combine an editorial team and filtering technology to maximize the quality of the Google ads on Google and publisher sites: Review: Across the Google network, ads are reviewed using a combination of human and automated processes before they are shown on publishers' sites. The review process takes into account a variety of factors, including the quality of the ad and whether the ad is suitable for all audiences. Sensitive content filters: At times, certain ads may not be appropriate to run on all pages. For example, Google automatically filters out ads that would be inappropriate on a news page about a catastrophic event. Please note that Google does not commit that all ads for the websites that you add to your URL filter list or ads containing objectionable content will be prevented from display on your site.  4. Can I show ads on more than one site?  The HTML code we provide you with is valid for any page in any site on which you want to display Google ads. However, you may only place the AdSense ad code or WebSearch code on sites that comply with our program policies and that you own or are legally authorized to act on behalf of for the purposes of Google AdSense. We also monitor all sites in AdSense to ensure that all pages displaying Google ads comply with our  urlLink program policies .  5. Do you guarantee to have relevant ads for my site?  Since the ability for us to serve ads on your site depends on a number of factors, such as our ability to crawl your site, the content of each of your web pages, and the availability of related Google ads, Google does not guarantee that we'll always have relevant ads to display. If we don't have relevant ads for a given page, or if we haven't yet crawled your site, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Similarly, if Google does not have ads for a search query, or if the query will return non-family-safe advertisements, we will not show ads.  6. How does participation in this program affect my site's position in the Google search results?  Participating in Google AdSense does not affect your site's rank in Google search results. Google AdSense will not affect the search results we deliver. Google believes strongly in freedom of expression and therefore offers broad access to content across the web. Our search results are unbiased by our relationships with paying advertisers and publishers. We will continue to show search results according to our PageRank technology. Adding the Google AdSense ad code or WebSearch code to your site will not queue your pages for crawling by our main index bots. While our bot (Mediapartners-Google/2.1+) does crawl content pages for the purpose of targeting ads, this crawl is not associated with our main index crawl.  7. Can I cancel my Google AdSense account?  You can participate in Google AdSense for as long as you wish, and currently, you can cancel at any time by removing the AdSense ad code and WebSearch code from your website pages. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence from us, please notify us of your account cancellation by sending an email to  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . For complete cancellation terms, please see our Terms and Conditions. You'll receive your final payment from us approximately 30 days after the end of the calendar month. Please note, however, that Google will not make payments for any earned balance less than $1.00. If you wish to cancel, we encourage you to let us know why our program didn't work for you. Please email us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . We'll carefully review your feedback. Our goal is to constantly improve our program, so we hope you'll try it again in the future when it may better suit your needs. In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, Google also reserves the right to terminate a publisher's account and refuse payment. Termination will apply to all selected products on an account (AdSense for search and AdSense for content). For complete cancellation terms, please see our  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  8. How do you prevent click and page impression spam?  Any method used to artificially and/or fraudulently generate clicks or page impressions is strictly prohibited. Google monitors clicks on Google ads to prevent abuse of the Google AdSense program. Google's proprietary technology analyzes clicks to determine whether they fit a pattern of use intended to fraudulently drive up an advertiser's clicks or a publisher's earnings. Clicks deemed by us to be invalid should not be included in your earnings. These prohibited methods include but are not limited to: repeated manual clicks, using robots, automated clicking tools, or other deceptive software. Please note that clicking on your own ads for any reason is prohibited, to avoid potential inflation of advertiser costs. All clicks must be generated as the result of a user clicking on the ads. We therefore require that Web pages do not include incentives of any kind for users to click on ads. This includes encouraging users to click on the ads or to visit the advertisers' sites as well as labeling the ads with text other than "sponsored links" or "advertisements." Please be assured that there is no need for test clicks in order to verify the validity of the ads. Our AdWords specialists review ads to verify that the destination URLs of the ads are working and lead to a valid website.  9. Can I display ads on search results pages?  Google AdSense now will allow ads to be placed on search results pages through our Online AdSense Program. Alternatively, Google WebSearch plus AdSense for search offers publishers the opportunity to provide search to their users, and to earn money from Google ads served to the search results pages. By simply adding a WebSearch box to any web page that meets our program policies, publishers can offer web search (and, optionally, site search) and benefit from Google-hosted, customizable, and monetized search results pages. For more information, please read the ' urlLink Getting Started ' section of this FAQ.   10. What are 'Alternate Ads?' Alternate ads allow you to utilize your ad space in the event that Google is unable to serve targeted ads to your page. By specifying an image, HTML page, or ad server of your choice, you can make sure that your advertising space is always being used effectively, either by targeted Google ads, or by your own choice of content. You can also select a solid color as your alternate ad, if you prefer not to display other advertisements or content when targeted Google ads are unavailable. Alternate ads count as page impressions like any other ad. Google does not keep track of clicks on alternate ads and you will not receive revenue for them. Alternate ads, if specified, will be shown when there are no targeted ads available for your page. The ad space will not be branded as 'Ads by Google.'   11. How do I Specify an Alternate Ad? You can specify an alternate ad URL from your Ad layout code page. Simply enter a fully qualified path to any image, HTML page, or ad server, and that URL will be loaded in the event that we cannot serve targeted ads to your page. You can also enter an HTML color code, to show a solid block of color when targeted ads are unavailable. 1. Log in to your AdSense account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/ 2. Click Settings3. Click Ad layout code4. After selecting a color palette and ad format, enter a fully qualified path to your image file, HTML page, or ad server in the Alternate Ad text box, or click Choose a color to select an HTML color code5. Copy and paste the ad code into your site pages Your alternate ad can point to any of the following formats: Static Images Clickable Images: To load a clickable image, specify an HTML page containing the link information for your ad. An example of code to include in your HTML page is below:  urlLink    Ad Server: You can also enter the URL of your ad server. For more information on linking to a third-party ad server, please contact your ad network directly. HTML color code: Enter the hex code for any color to show a solid block of color as your alternate ad. Please note that the target image or ad will be cropped if it is larger than your selected AdSense ad format.   12. Do my users see the same ads that I see? The AdSense program uses geotargeting to serve Google ads to your pages - ads are specific to a user's region and language, based on their IP address. This means that the ads that are served to a user from Australia may be different than those that appear for a user from Canada. Geotargeting makes the ads even more relevant for visitors to your site, and also means that you may not see all of the ads that can be served to your pages. If you'd like to see what ads your users from other regions are seeing, our AdSense Preview Tool gives you the ability to preview the ads that would show on any web page, from a number of different locations. For more information, please read the  urlLink AdSense Preview Tool FAQ .  Eligibility   1. Are there eligibility criteria for my site in order to participate in Google AdSense?  Yes. There are  urlLink program policies  that you and your site must comply with in order to participate in the AdSense program. Please review our policies before submitting your application. Please note that we may change our policies at any time, and per the Google AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions , it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with and adhere to the posted policies.  2. How do you enforce the program policies?  All publishers are reviewed for policy compliance when they submit their application. Also, we randomly monitor sites in Google AdSense to check for continued compliance with our policies. If we find sites that do not comply with our  urlLink policies  or  urlLink Terms and Conditions , we will suspend or terminate the accounts. In some cases, payment for clicks may be refused.  3. If I am a Google AdWords advertiser, can I sign up?  Yes. We are excited to help you find yet another way for you to increase your revenue. You can even use the same login name and password so you don't have to keep track of multiple Google logins. Editing your login information in one account will edit in the other as well.  4. Are non-English websites eligible for Google AdSense?  Yes. Google AdSense supports publishers in several different languages. Applications for participation in the program can be for sites with content primarily in: Danish Italian Dutch Japanese English Norwegian Finnish Portuguese French Spanish German Swedish You can select your site's primary language during the application process. If you're approved, AdSense will serve relevant ads to your pages in the appropriate language, even if your site contains multiple supported languages.  5. Can I sign up if I am already a part of an ad network?  Yes. However, we do not permit Google ads to be published on web pages that also contain what could be considered competing ads. This would include all content-targeted ads as well as text-based ads. Text-based ads, for this situation, can be loosely defined as ads that mimic Google texts ads or appear to be associated with Google text ads on your site. We do allow affiliate or limited-text links. If you already display Google ads on your pages via an ad network, you can still join AdSense and run ads on your site through our program. Multiple ad units may be displayed on each Web site page, but no ad unit can contain any advertisement in common with any other ad unit. It's your responsibility to work out any contractual issues that may arise with your ad network as a result of serving Google ads directly.  6. Can I sign up for more than one account?  Publishers are not permitted to maintain multiple AdSense accounts.  Payments   1. How much will I earn through this program?  The Google ads you are able to display on your content pages and WebSearch results pages are cost-per-click (CPC) ads. This means that advertisers pay only when users click on ads. You'll receive a portion of the amount paid for clicks on Google ads on your website. Although we don't disclose the exact revenue share, our goal is to enable publishers to make as much or more than they could with other advertising networks. We'll send your payment for your account balance in accordance with the  urlLink Terms and Conditions . You can view your earnings at any time by logging in to your Google AdSense account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/  and clicking the Reports tab. You'll be able to see the total number of page impressions, ad clicks, clickthrough rate, effective CPM, and your total earnings so you can get an idea of how well the program is performing for you and how much you can expect to earn over time in the program. Please note that these reports and the information contained in them are confidential. However, we do understand that you may have a need to report yearly or quarterly total earnings from Google AdSense for tax purposes.  2. Does Google guarantee revenues?  Since the revenue that you may earn through Google AdSense depends on the content of each of your web pages or the search terms entered by your users, as well as the availability of related Google ads, Google does not guarantee that you will earn any revenue amount.  3. What form of payment will I receive?  Currently, AdSense participants will receive payments via check in US Dollars. We hope to add additional payment options in the coming months. Please check back here to find out when we release more payment methods.  4. When do I get paid?  Google will mail you a check approximately 30 days after the end of each calendar month that Google ads are running on your site or WebSearch results pages if your earned balance is US $100 or more, unless otherwise agreed to in writing (including electronic mail). If your account balance is less than $100, we'll send you a check approximately 30 days after the first month that your balance reaches $100. Balances include the combined earnings of AdSense and WebSearch pages. Please note that if a publisher's account is found to be in violation of our  urlLink Terms and Conditions  or  urlLink policies , we may at any time withhold payment (beginning from when Google initiates its investigation of potential violations), charge back the publisher's account, and/or refund advertisers for clicks received on the publisher's site or WebSearch results page. In addition, if a publisher is past due on any payment to Google in connection with the Google AdWords program, we reserve the right to withhold payment until all outstanding payments have been made. For a complete description of payment terms, please refer to the AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  Tax Information    1. Will I have to pay taxes on my AdSense earnings?  It is the responsibility of each publisher to understand and adhere to the appropriate tax rules. Google is required by United States tax laws to collect certain tax-related information from you. However, we are not able to provide you with tax advice. Any tax-related information provided by Google is not intended as and should not be construed as legal, tax or investment advice. You should always consult your tax advisor to help answer specific questions regarding how tax laws apply to you and/or your business. The tax summary we have provided is necessarily incomplete, and the tax laws and regulations are subject to change. Therefore, Google does not guarantee and is not liable for the accuracy or completeness of any tax information provided, or any results or outcome as a result of the use of this information. Please review these resources for additional information about tax regulations: For general information about AdSense and taxes, please visit our  urlLink Tax Information Page . For specific information regarding U.S. tax requirements, please visit the  urlLink IRS website . For tax advice or more technical questions about how tax laws apply to you, please consult your tax adviser. For general questions about submitting your tax information to Google AdSense, you can email  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  2. Does Google have to collect my tax information?  Yes, if you are approved to participate in the Google AdSense Online Program, we are required to collect certain information from you for tax purposes. For U.S. publishers, this will include a tax I.D. such as a U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or a Social Security Number (SSN). International publishers will need to submit Internal Revenue Service form W-8, Form 8233, or certify that they do not have U.S. Activities. We have provided an easy-to-use interface that will help you to select the appropriate form for your tax situation. The tax information interface is available from the 'Tax information' page of your publisher account, below the Account Information tab. Google uses industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology to protect this and other personal information you provide us. Please read the  urlLink Google Privacy Policy  for more information about what we do to protect your privacy  3. What if I don't have a tax I.D.?  If you do not have a tax I.D. such as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN), and are either a U.S. business or individual, or a non-U.S. business with U.S. Activities, as described on our AdSense  urlLink Tax Information Page , you'll need to acquire one. We suggest that you obtain your TIN as soon as possible. Please note that the process of obtaining a TIN may take several weeks. You can visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website for more information on obtaining a U.S. TIN:  urlLink IRS information page .  4. How do I submit my tax information to Google?  We have provided an easy-to-use interface that will help you to select the appropriate form for your tax situation. Most of the forms are available to submit online, and instructions for submitting any other forms offline are also provided. The tax submission interface is available when you log in to your AdSense account. Please note that the tax information collection interface and any tax-related information provided by Google is not intended as and should not be construed as legal, tax, or investment advice. You should always consult your tax advisor to help answer specific questions regarding how tax laws apply to you and/or your business. The tax summary we have provided is necessarily incomplete, and the tax laws and regulations are subject to change. Therefore, Google does not guarantee and is not liable for the accuracy or completeness of any tax information provided, or any results or outcome as a result of the use of this information.  5. When do I need to submit my tax information?  Google began collecting tax information from all publishers on November 13, 2003. New publishers after this date must submit their tax information through the 'Tax information' page of their publisher account before any payments can be sent to them. If tax forms have not been submitted, you will still be able to access your publisher account, show ads, and register earnings. You'll collect all revenue due to you under the Google AdSense Online Program Agreement once you have submitted your tax information. Google will try to make such payments in the first payment cycle following your submission of this information (provided that you have met the $100 earnings threshold referenced in the Google AdSense Online Program Agreement).  6. What is an EIN and do I need one?  Publishers holding Business accounts may be required to provide an Employer Identification Number for tax purposes. To find out whether you need an EIN, please visit the IRS website at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch01.html#d0e626 . In addition, all U.S. publishers applying for a Business account will be required to provide an EIN during sign-up for verification purposes. There are 3 ways to get an EIN: Online: Click the EIN link at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small . Your EIN will be issued immediately once the application information is validated. By telephone at 1-800-829-4933 from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the local time zone. By mailing or faxing Form SS-4, "Application for Employer Identification Number," to the IRS.  Format   1. What are the layout options for ads on my web pages?  Google lets you select the colors and layout that best fit your site. Ad ColorsYou can select from pre-defined color palettes, or you can create up to 100 of your own. Color palettes allow you to make sure that the ad text, background, and border colors complement your website. For added variety and freshness, you can even choose to rotate through up to 4 different color palettes at a time. To take advantage of this feature, you'll need a newer web browser with JavaScript functionality (Internet Explorer 5.5+ or Netscape 6+). However, the color choices will be visible to users of most web browsers. Ad LayoutsYou can choose from multiple ad layouts, designed to suit a wide variety of page designs. Examples of each format are available on the  urlLink Ad Formats  page. Please show only one ad unit per page.  2. How do I know which ad layout works best on my site?  You can use channels to track the performance of different ad layouts across your pages. Channels allow you to specify groups of pages for reporting purposes, and provide a detailed look at your clicks, impressions, and earnings. In addition, please read our  urlLink Tips  page for help with optimizing your pages for maximum AdSense revenue  3. Can I display more than one set of Google ads on a web page?  Only one ad unit may be placed on any web page, regardless of its layout, color, or ad type selection. Our  urlLink Terms and Conditions  state that multiple ad units may be displayed on each Web site page, but no ad unit can contain any advertisement in common with any other ad unit. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to ensure that duplicate advertisements will not be served to a second ad unit â consequently, only one ad unit may be placed on any web page at this time.  4. Can I alter the AdSense ad code?  No. Please paste the AdSense ad code into your web pages without making any modifications.  My Account   1. What reports can I view?  You'll be able to view reports for a specific day or date range, on an aggregate level or broken down into your defined  urlLink channels . You'll see the total number of page impressions, ad clicks, clickthrough rate (CTR), cost per thousand impressions (effective CPM), and your earnings. Aggregate reports are typically updated hourly, with an occasional delay of up to 24 hours. Channel report data is delayed 2 days to allow for synchronization of information across all channels.  2. What is a page impression?  We count a page impression when our AdSense JavaScript is actually executed by a user's browser and ads are displayed. This is generally the equivalent to a page view, but as described in question 3 below, there are instances that wouldn't execute the ad code and that would cause a discrepancy between the page impressions you register and the page impressions that appear in your AdSense account.  3. Why do I detect a different number of page impressions than what shows in my reports?  We count page impressions only when our ad code is executed by a user's browser. There are therefore several factors that would cause a discrepancy between the page impressions you register and the page impressions listed in your AdSense account. Instances that wouldn't execute the code include: Spiders, robots, or crawlers from other search engines Browsers that don't have JavaScript enabled or don't support JavaScript Browsers that don't support the   tag Programs that people may have written to grab website content  4. How do I change my password?  Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Login Information Click Edit login information Enter your old and new passwords in the fields provided Click Save changes  5. How do I change my payment address?  Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Address Information Click Edit address Edit your information Click Save changes If you require an update to your payee name, please contact us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  6. How do I edit placement of the ads on my web page?  Delete the AdSense ad code that you currently have on your page Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad layout code under the Ad Settings tab Copy the ad code for the new layout you want Paste the new code in the appropriate place in your web page Save your changes, and the new layout should take place immediately  7. How do I customize the color of the ads on my website?  You can select from a number of built-in color palettes, or you can create up to 100 of your own. When you select a color palette and an ad layout on the Ad layout code page, the appropriate ad code is generated for you. You can select up to 4 palettes that will rotate randomly. To take advantage of this feature, you'll need a newer web browser with JavaScript functionality (Internet Explorer 5.5+ or Netscape 6+). To generate ad code with the palette of your choice: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad layout code under the Ad Settings tab Select up to 4 color palettes by holding down the Ctrl key Choose the ad layout Copy-and-paste the AdSense ad code into web pages To create custom color palettes and manage your palette list: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad colors under the Ad Settings tab(or click the Manage Color Palettes link on the Ad layout code page) Select a pre-existing color palette to start with Choose the color you want for each area of the ads (border, background, title, text, and URL) Name your new palette Click Save  8. How do I add sites to my filter list?  You can add up to 200 sites to your filter list. The URLs you enter into your filter list can be the actual URL of the website or the URL that is displayed on the ad for that website. Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click URL Filter List under the Ad Settings tab (for content pages) or Search Settings tab (for WebSearch results pages) Click Add / Edit Sites In the appropriate text box, enter the URLs of the sites whose ads you would like to filter from your site or WebSearch results pages Save your changes  9. How do I know the URLs of the ads on my site?  If you would like to add a URL to your filter list but the path is not visible, please do not click on the ad to retrieve the URL. Clicking the ads on your site will artificially drive up advertiser costs. We suggest using the AdSense Preview Tool to view the ads that will show on each of your pages. The Preview Tool allows you to click through to the advertiser's site without generating invalid clicks, and provides an easy way to display the target URL of all ads. For more information about the Preview Tool, including a download link, please read our  urlLink AdSense Preview Tool FAQ .Alternatively, to view the URL of ads directly from your web pages, you can also follow these steps: Right-click on the ad title and select either 'Copy Shortcut' (IE) or 'Copy Link Location' (Netscape). Paste the selection into a text editor for editing. The destination URL of the ad includes the text between 'adurl=' and ''. As an example, the copied URL will appear as follows: http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/adclick?sa=l(...)=http://www.blogger.com= or http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/adclick?adurl=http://www.blogger.com= The destination URL in the example above is 'http://www.blogger.com'. You can view the ad by entering the URL into your browser's address bar. Adding 'blogger.com' to your filter list will block ads originating from this domain.  10. How do I add more sites to my account?  The scripts on the Ad layout code page and Search code page are valid for any page in any site on which you want to display Google ads. Simply add the code to any page, and we'll automatically detect the new site.  11. How do I cancel my account?  Currently, you can cancel your account at any time simply by removing the AdSense ad code and/or WebSearch code from your web pages. You will receive your final payment within approximately 30 days of the end of the month, or at the end of the year if your earnings balance is less than $100. Please note, however, that Google will not make payments for any earned balance less than $1.00. For complete cancellation terms, please see our  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  12. What is the Framed page checkbox?  Select the 'Framed page' checkbox if you will be placing your ad layout code on a page that uses frames. Selecting this option will tell our crawlers to gather content from the appropriate frame, thereby enabling us to serve relevant ads. Please note that your ad layout code must be included in the same frame as your page's main content.  13. How do I change my display language?  To change the display language for your AdSense account: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Login Information Click Edit Information and select a language from the Display Language drop-down list Click Save Changes This will update the display language for your account pages as well as for online resources, such as the FAQ and  urlLink program policies .  14. How do I change my payee information?  In order to protect your account, the payee name cannot be changed. Our program policies also do not allow the transfer of accounts. If you need to change your payee name for any reason, please contact  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . Our specialists will be able to cancel your current account so that you may submit a new application with your updated payee information  Image Ads   1. What are image ads?  Image ads are graphical ads offered initially in  urlLink 4 major formats . Unlike traditional banner advertising, Google's image ads are precisely targeted to the content of a publisher's web page using our AdSense contextual advertising technology. Advertisers target image ads by selecting keywords related to their product offerings, and Google matches the image ads to the content and context of your web pages. Running a combination of image and text ads expands the available ad inventory for your site, and offers the potential for increased revenue. Google's technology determines on a page-by-page basis whether text ads or image ads are likely to make you more money, and serves the appropriate format to your page. Google image ads are currently in beta and are not available on WebSearch results pages. Please send your comments and questions to  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  2. Do I have to run image ads?  The decision to run image ads is entirely yours. You can choose to run image ads in addition to text ads, or you can show text ads alone. You can decide which types of ads to run across your entire account or make your selection one page at a time. You always maintain full control over the types of advertising that show on your web pages.  3. How do I enable/disable image ads?  There are two ways to enable image ads: you can select a radio button in your AdSense UI to enable image and text advertising for all of your pages, or you can enable image ads for individual pages. Enabling image ads for individual pages will always override any selections you make on an account-wide level. Enabling image ads across your account: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Products Click Edit information To include image ads in the inventory for all pages, select Display text and image ads in all ad units. Please note that any page with a specific manual selection, as described below, will not be affected by changes to this setting. Enabling image ads for individual pages: Enabling image ads on individual pages is easy. Simply make your selection when generating your ad code and replace your existing AdSense code as described below. This is useful, for example, if you decide to include image ads on all of your pages, but donât want image ads on your home page. Log in to you account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Ad Settings tab Click Ad layout code When generating your ad layout code, select either Text ads only or Include image ads from the Ad Type drop-down menu. Copy and paste this ad code into the appropriate pages of your site. Your manual ad type setting will remain in effect despite any changes made to your account-wide setting, as described above.  4. Will I earn more with image ads?  While we can't make any guarantees about the earnings potential of image or text ads, we believe that image ads will prove to be a high-performing option for publishers looking to monetize their pages. In fact, we show image ads when they have a higher value to you than the corresponding set of text ads that might otherwise run in the same slot.  5. Can I run only image ads?  At this time, we are only offering publishers the ability to select image ads with text ads on a given page. This allows us to serve the most targeted and highest revenue generating ads to your pages, providing a better user experience to your siteâs visitors and potentially increasing your AdSense revenue. Also, because this is a beta feature that is new for advertisers as well as publishers, the available inventory of image ads may initially be low.  6. How are image ads reviewed?  Image ads are reviewed using a combination of human and automated processes before they are served to your pages. This review considers many factors, including image quality, the content of the image, and whether the ad is suitable for all audiences. If you see a Google image ad that you feel is inappropriate or misleading, please click the Feedback: Ads by Google link below the image ad. Using this link will flag the ad for additional review, and will also allow us to review your comments and suggestions to help us improve our AdSense program.  7. What are the formats in which image ads are available?  At this time, image ads are available in the following four formats: leaderboard (728x90) banner (468x60) skyscraper (120x600) medium rectangle (300x250) You can see examples of each of these formats on our  urlLink AdSense Ad Formats  page.  8. Can I customize the appearance of image ads on my site?  The border color of image ads can be customized using your color palette options. The border color will be the same as the border color that you have selected for text ads.  9. How can I track image ad performance?  Your AdSense reports will not show image ad clicks separately from text ads clicks at this time.  10. Will image ads slow my page load time?  Google image ads are limited to 50KB in size, and should have a minimal effect on load time for most sites.  WebSearch   1. What is WebSearch plus AdSense for search?  WebSearch is for publishers who wish to provide web search for their users, directly from any web page. WebSearch results pages use Google's search to provide relevant results, and the search results pages are customizable to fit with your siteâs theme. In addition, results pages are monetized with Google ads that are targeted to the user's query â providing useful information for the user, and a new revenue stream for publishers. To add WebSearch to your web pages, simply complete our online application. If your site is approved, weâll provide you with code to insert into your web pages that will generate our WebSearch box anywhere on your page.  2. How do I sign up?  The program is free, and Google pays you for valid clicks on the ads on your search results pages. So go ahead and try this program. If you comply with our  urlLink program policies , just complete our  urlLink online application  and select either or both of AdSense for content pages and WebSearch plus AdSense. One application gets you approved for both AdSense and WebSearch â you can decide to use any combination of these products on your pages. We'll review your application and follow up with an email within 2-3 days. If you are accepted into the program, you can log in to your new account and get the HTML code to insert into your web pages. Existing AdSense for content publishers do not need to apply again - simply activate WebSearch from the Products link below the Account Information tab in your AdSense account.  3. What is SiteSearch?  SiteSearch is an optional element of WebSearch, allowing users to search within the pages of your website. SiteSearch results also benefit from Google pay-per-click ads, allowing you to earn revenue from user searches of your site. Because SiteSearch uses Google's search index to return the most relevant results from within your domain, SiteSearch will not be able to search any pages that have not been added to the Google index. Please note that adding SiteSearch to any page will not queue that page for crawling by our bots. If you would like to manually add your site's main URL to our crawl, you may do so at  urlLink http://www.google.com/addurl.html . Submitting your site in this manner does not guarantee inclusion in Google's index.  4. How is WebSearch different from Google Free search?  While both search products offer Google's search to web publishers, Google WebSearch also offers the ability to monetize user searches from your site. Using AdSense technology to target Google ads to WebSearch results pages, we can provide publishers with relevant web or site search results as well as a new revenue stream. In addition, while both Google Free and WebSearch use Google-hosted results pages, WebSearch results pages are customizable and can carry the publisher's logo and colors. Both products are free for web publishers. Google Free code can be copied from www.google.com/searchcode.html. WebSearch code is only available to publishers who meet our  urlLink program policies  and  urlLink Terms and Conditions . If youâd like to submit a program application please visit  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense .  5. How does Google target ads to WebSearch queries?  WebSearch uses Google search to return search results to end users. The search results that appear on a WebSearch results page will be very similar to those that appear on Google.com. Google ads are targeted to these results based on our targeting algorithm, which takes words and phrases included in the query and matches them to relevant ad campaigns. Ads are also matched to the language of the query â for example, a search using a French query will generally return ads in the French language. Ads in other languages may appear, due to advertisers' targeting decisions.  6. How do I add WebSearch to my pages?  Providing WebSearch to your users is a simple process. If your application is approved, we'll provide you with WebSearch HTML code to paste into your web pages. You can paste the default code into your source to start providing search instantly to your users, or spend some time customizing the WebSearch box before pasting your code. To get the WebSearch code: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Search Settings tab Click Search Code Select your site encoding from the drop-down list Select the desired additional search options: SafeSearch and/or SiteSearch Choose your style palette. You can choose from our standard color palettes, or customize your palette to include your own colors and logo. Copy and paste the WebSearch code from the 'WebSearch Code' box into your HTML pages.  7. Is SafeSearch available for WebSearch?  Many Google users prefer not to have adult sites included in their search results. Google's SafeSearch screens for sites that contain pornography and explicit sexual content and eliminates them from search results. While no filter is 100% accurate, Google's filter uses advanced proprietary technology that checks keywords and phrases, URLs and Open Directory categories.  8. Can I display WebSearch and Google ads on the same web page?  Yes. You can place a WebSearch box on any page that meets our program policies, even if you're already showing Google ads on that page. Searches from the WebSearch box will lead to a Google-hosted results page that is also monetized with Google ads, allowing you to monetize all aspects of your site.  9. Can I use other internet search services with WebSearch?  We require that publishers do not add other internet search services to sites displaying the WebSearch box. Publishers using the optional SiteSearch feature may also use alternate site search products on their pages.  10. Are WebSearch clicks separated from content impressions and clicks?  Your reports are separated for the purposes of tracking AdSense for content clicks and WebSearch clicks. To view your WebSearch data, click the Search Performance link below the Reports tab in your publisher account.  11. How do I customize my WebSearch results pages?  WebSearch results pages are customizable to include your own color schemes and logo. Your logo can also be configured to be a clickable image, linking to the URL of any page that complies with our program policies. Your custom colors and logo are saved as 'style palettes,' allowing you to use different color schemes for results pages from different pages of your site. To customize your WebSearch results page: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Search Settings tab Click Styles Using the color palette and the page element radio buttons, select a color for each element of your search results page. The example page will be updated with your new colors as they are selected. Enter the URL of the logo you'd like to show on this page. If no logo is selected, a transparent box will be displayed. If you've chosen to display a logo, enter the height and width (maximum 50 pixels) and the target URL of the image. Name this custom style palette and click Save. The style palette is now available for selection from the 'Search Code' page of your account.  12. What are the fees mentioned in the Terms and Conditions?  The WebSearch fees that are referenced in the AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions  will not be applied to all publishers. Google incurs a cost for each search that is performed through WebSearch, and generally we cover this cost through our portion of the earnings from advertiser clicks. However, publishers with very high numbers of searches in relation to their revenue may have an amount deducted from their final WebSearch earnings. We expect the number of publishers to be impacted by this to be very small â less than 1% will be affected. The WebSearch fees will never be greater than the publisher's WebSearch earnings, so no publisher will owe Google at the end of the month as a result of these fees. Earnings from AdSense for content clicks will not be affected. The adjustment will take place at the end of each month, when earnings are calculated.  Channels   1. What are channels?  Channels provide you with a way to view detailed reporting about the performance of your pages. By pasting channel-specific ad code into any combination of pages, you can track a variety of metrics across your sites. Track your leaderboard performance versus the performance of your towers, or compare your motorcycle pages to your automobile pages, by assigning each group of pages to a specific channel and comparing results in your custom channel reports. You can even assign a channel to each of your separate domains, to see where your clicks are coming from. With up to 50 AdSense channels, plus 50 WebSearch channels available for each publisher, you can use channels to gain the insight you need to optimize your site's performance. It's easy to add, deactivate, or rename your channels, and customized reports are simple to generate.  2. How do I create channels?  Before creating your channels, you may want to take some time to consider how channels can best be used on your site. Think about which metrics you would like to track â are you looking to compare performance of various ad layouts, or do you want to find out which groups of pages are generating the most clicks? When creating channels, we suggest that you use descriptive names for each channel, so that they are easily identifiable in your reports. Once you've decided how you're going to use channels, there are two steps to creating them: first, the creation of the channel name; and second, adding the channel-specific code to your web pages. To create a new channel name: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense   From the links below the Ad Settings or Search Settings tab, click Channels Select the Create new channel radio button, and enter a channel name in the text field. We suggest using a name that will help you to identify this channel later. For example, carpages or blue_skyscrapers Click Edit/Activate channel. Your new channel will be added to the Active Channels list. To add the channel-specific code to your page: Click the appropriate Settings tab and click Ad Layout code or Search code, or click Continue to Ad Layout from the Create Channels page From the Channel drop-down list, select the appropriate channel for this code Copy-and-paste the ad layout code into your web pages. The channel identifier within your code will track performance on these pages. A page can be moved to a different channel by updating the code on that page. A page can also be removed from all channels by specifying No channel selection when generating the code.  3. How do I deactivate a channel?  Channels can be deactivated at any time from within your publisher account. Data will no longer be collected for deactivated channels, but you can always pull up the historical data for a deactivated channel when generating reports. You also have the option of reactivating the channel at a later date. Deactivated channels do not count towards your total allowed channel number. To deactivate a channel: Click the Settings tab Click the Channels link From the Active Channels list, select the channel(s) to remove Click Deactivate. To reactivate a channel: Click the Settings tab, or click Continue to Ad Layout from the Create Channels page Click the Channels link Select the Reactivate Channel radio button From the drop-down list, select the channel to reactivate Click Edit/Activate channel The channel will be reactivated, and added to the Active Channels list.  4. How do I view channel reports?  Channel reports are accessible from your Reports tab. After selecting a date range and breakdown type, select the Channels Data radio button. Choose any number of Active or Deleted channels from the channels list by holding the CTRL key while selecting. Click Display Report to create your custom channel report. Your channel reports will show data for all selected channels, including page impressions, clicks, and earnings data. Please note that data for channel reports is delayed 2 days before being displayed, as described in the question below.  5. How are channel earnings displayed?  Numbers for channel reports are not displayed in near-real-time as they are for aggregate reports. To allow for the data to fully synchronize across all channels, your channel information will be delayed for two days before being shown. These days will show No data available in your channel reports. Aggregate reports will show up to date information on an account level, which includes all channels as well as pages that are not assigned to any channel.  6. Can I download my reports?  Yes. AdSense offers downloadable reports in comma separated values (CSV) format. To download: From your reports page, generate the report that you would like to download When your report has been created, click Download CSV file from the header bar of your report A download prompt will appear - enter a filename and location, and click Save. CSV files can be easily imported into common spreadsheet applications. Downloadable reports make it easy to chart the results of your channels, as well as historical data from your account.  Copyright   1. What is your policy on copyright infringement?  It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). For AdSense publishers, if we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that your site is infringing, we may terminate your participation in the program. More information about our DMCA process is available here  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html .  2. What is copyright infringement?  If you have a question about whether what you are doing is copyright infringement, you should consult with a lawyer. Generally, copyright infringement involves making a copy of someone else's work without their permission. For more information on this Act, please refer to the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site at  urlLink http://lcWeb.loc.gov/copyright/ .  3. How do I report a copyright infringement by an AdSense publisher?  If you believe that another site is illegally copying the contents of your site, you may send a notice of alleged infringement by following the procedure at  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html . When you have sent the notice, please notify us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com , and we will take appropriate action.  4. What do I do if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?  You may file a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA, at  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html#counter . When you have done this, please notify us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  Privacy and Security   1. Does Google collect information about my site?  We securely collect and store the information you provide us through your Google AdSense online account. We will also crawl your site periodically to serve the most relevant content ads on your site's pages.  2. What does Google do with my personal information?  First, we make sure that it is securely processed and stored as stated in the Google  urlLink Privacy Policy . We use your personal information solely for the purpose of running your account and communicating account information to you. Please note that Google may disclose to third parties personally identifiable information about you for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in the AdSense Program as described in the  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  3. How secure is my account information?  We understand that completing an online transaction requires a great deal of trust. We take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information you provide. Google uses industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology to protect every interaction you have with us. This protects your tax I.D. and other personal information. Please also read the Google  urlLink Privacy Policy . Extremely boring!

Don't be daunted by the sheer numberof ways you can approach musical performance - most people find a few goodtechniques that fit their creative needs and build from there.  Have fun! The Producer setup will automatically uninstall any existing versions ofProducer found on your machine. It's recommended that you close Producer before attempting to install. The DirectX8 version of Producer defaults to a different folder than previousversions, so if you have a shortcut pointing to the old location that shortcutwill no longer work. Producer requires the DirectX8.1 version of DirectMusic, as Producer functionality is built entirely on top of DirectMusic. (The Producer installation process will prompt you to install the DirectX8.1 runtime bits, if they are not already present.)  DirectMusic Producer also requires IE6.0 (or higher).  Attempting to access Producer Help documentation will result in scripting errors with versions of Internet Explorer before IE6.0.  Note that Producer is very memory-intensive because of all of the editing, displayand undo information that is processed.  The overall authoring experience will be improved by having machines with a significant amount of memory.  Note also that DirectMusic runtime performance is much more efficient by comparison. DX8.1 Producer is not intended to be an authoring application for DX7 content. Demo8 Sample Content--------------------A project of sample content can be found on the SDK CD at "\dxf\dxsdk\essentls\dmusprod\democontent\dmpdemocontent.exe".  The project will install to "My Documents\DMUSProducer\Demo8\" on your hard drive. New in this Release-------------------1. Super low latencyThis option is defined via the MIDI/Performance Options button, enabling much lowerlatency, low enough to input notes from a keyboard in real time.  This is only available if your soundcard uses a WDM driver, and actual performance will vary depending on the speed of the machine. Note also that the threshold for auditioning the software synth while recording MIDI in Producer has been increased to 60 milliseconds.  If the total latency (as displayed in the Synth Status toolbar) is under 60 milliseconds then you'll hear the software synth play back notes while recording.  If it is over 60 milliseconds, then the software synth will be muted; in this case it is recommended to enable the local output of a hardware synth for recording MIDI input. 2. Wave capture streamlinedWhile the 'File Output' DMO is still available, it is no longer required for wavecapture.  Users can simply turn on "super low latency" (see #1) and set up wave capture in the wave/MIDI export toolbar. 3. DLS/wave editinga. The user has the option of selecting L, R or stereo files when selecting wavesfor DLS regions (stereo waves are still 2 mono waves under the hood though). b. "Replace" functionality for waves in DLS.  Right click on the wave to be replacedin the Waves folder, then select the new wave to take its place. c. Text labels provided on DLS regions (listing the wave used per region).d. Many more edit boxes (in addition to sliders) are writable in DLS. e. Insert Silence option in Wave EditorRight click in the wave editor, specify amount to be inserted at cursor.f. Resample WaveRight click in the wave editor: Resample, specify the new sample rate.  4. Segment Designera. Multiple waves imported as segmentsThere is a new item in the File menu: Import&gt;Wave File as Segment.  In the file requester, users can multiple select wave files via Ctrl or Shift keys.  The resulting segments are clocktime segments that match the length of each wave.  b. Ability to edit segment length based on clocktimeIn the segment property page, users can now set length based on minutes, seconds and milliseconds. c. Wave Track objects can be multiple selected via Ctrl or Shift Clicking.d. Ability to start/stop segment while editing DMO in audiopathKeyboard shortcuts (Alt+</post></Blog>
