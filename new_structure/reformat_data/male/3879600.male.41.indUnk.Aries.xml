						   This evening, we distinguish between the short story and novel format. Amy has a good start to a story. I read my  urlLink The Lioness  and we discuss its problems,  urlLink   strengths. Sharon discusses Ian Watsonâs  urlLink Mockymen  (2003), which sheâs enjoying. We read a few passages from Henry Millerâs  urlLink Tropic of Capricorn . Then, I finish by reading a short selection of  urlLink Rust Hillsâ book on short story . I feel like I do too much of the talking, though most of it is reading to the group. Iâm flattered, honestly, they like my reading voice so, and will keep trying to please them.

						    urlLink       WHO WE ARE : We meet at Kherryâs house or ( alfresco ) at Skinnerâs Butte Park every other Thursday evening (in Eugene, Oregon) and have since late 2003. Anyone can join (and once a member, always a member).    WHAT WE DO : We analyze short fiction, poetry, books, and recent movies: their strengths and weaknesses, what we like and donât like about them. We also bring in our  own  writing to be commented on by members, and we experiment with writing exercises and assignments.   OUR PHILOSOPHY : All of us in America haved learned to write via ânegative feedbackâ (akin to the piano student learning to play whileher teacher stands above her, ruler-in-hand). Hence, most of us have trouble expressing ourselves creatively on page. Itâs no wonder! And itâs terribly hard to get honest yet supportive feedback.  Our approach is to modify these negative approaches from the past. We do this by discussing what we LIKE about a piece first; from there (after credibility has been set, and it takes careful work, sometimes, but thereâs  always  something good about a writing sample), we talk about what we didnât like or didnât understand. Weâre supportive of each otherâs growth and believe our writing can be further perfected.    CURRENT MEMBERS ARE :  urlLink Kherry  -- Jade --  urlLink Nathan  --  urlLink Amy  -- Sherry --  Terri. (Others have visited.)    MORE INFORMATION : kherry1bear@yahoo.com

       urlLink     People who enjoy the piano in general and my playing in particular have asked over the years that I explain my approach to playing.  One sweet woman and mother of a teen student asked, "What should I do so that 'Johnny' might play like you?"  I was taken back by the question and said something like: "Johnny will have a unique sound, don't worry -- because he's a unique person, and musician, and we  all  have a unique sound."  Weeks went by after this incident, and I thought about her compliment more deeply.  I realized what I said to her wasn't a real response to her question.  She was noticing something very true about piano playing.  In fact, many pianists sound a lot alike.  And she somehow knew in this world of specialization, Johnny's only hope was to develop his own sound.  She's delved into a more important question; the words she'd used didn't quite do her imagination justice.  She was attempting, I now see, to ask something like, "How can I help Johnny veer away from run-of-the-mill, 'standard' piano playing and find more of a unique, creative, 'expressive' sound, a sound I associate, at least at times, with you?"  If I could have answered her again, this is what I would say.  First, I'd ask her a few questions, a superb way of filtering through what might become a web of misunderstandings as our talk progressed.  I'd ask her what musicians she likes and what period of piano music, in particular.  I'd ask her if she hoped Johnny might make a living from music, either as a nightly piano grinder, or even, if he's lucky, as a recording artist.  I'd then ask her to sit and close her eyes.  Using quasi-regressional techniques, I'd ask her about her first memories regarding music.  What was the first song she remembered?  How did it move her?  When did she understand what "music" was (as opposed to noise), and how did that affect her?  Answering the same for her, I would mention a 78 LP-folk recording of 'Puff the Magic Dragon' as the first moment I realized I was listening to a "song": what I'd come to understand was a string of notes composed (I would have used "made up" then) solely for my enjoyment and that of others.  I was about five at the time.  I realized then, as I listened about Puff and how he lived by the Sea, that someone had "pretended" Puff to entertain me and had made up a melody to tell the story.  They had made up the notes or "tones" that comprised his story, and these were meant to sound pleasing, to be memorable.  I'd realized I was listening to a "song."  I knew, too, that its greatest power was that it made me  feel , and not just feel any old way: to feel sad for Puff; to feel his loneliness; to feel especially for Puff having to go away.  I understood the song's themes: friendship, saying goodbye, and growing up (though at five, only as a five-year-old does).  More importantly, though, I stepped back (the only way I can describe it) and saw that a song (and music in general) are very special ways to be told something, told a story, or be made to feel.  I, and I remember actually thinking this, knew that a song was no doubt the MOST POWERFUL way a person can convey feelings to another.  I was amazed.  I looked at the LP's dust jacked and circular insert, reading the information it offered.  It was like receiving a present from God.  Years past.  Like many middle-class kids, I began taking music lessons.  I started with the clarinet, age nine.  I was not very good.  I didn't care much for the its sound, and worse, blowing into it made my cheeks sore.  I rarely practiced.  I'd played around with an old hammond organ we had in our house through my childhood, so when we acquired a new piano, I decided to try lessons.  I was eleven or twelve.  To be continued . . . .

       urlLink   By Kherry McKay   California Governor  urlLink Arnold Schwarzenegger  calls his state legislature â urlLink Girlie Men â for their stall on passing the  urlLink $103-billion budget . He says politicians, mostly Democrats, are âpart of a bureaucracy thatâs out of shape, out of date, out of touch, and thatâs definitely out of control in Sacramentoâ (the stateâs capital). It seems Schwarzenegger put his hand purposefully in a feminist beehive. The denunciation of his rhetoric came from all quarters, as nonplused feminists cried fervid complaints.  urlLink Senator Sheila Kuehl  (D-Santa Monica), chairwoman of the state  urlLink Natural Resources and Wildlife Committee and member of the â urlLink Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus â is outraged.   urlLink   âItâs really painful,â she notes, â. . . to hear the governor resort to such blatant  urlLink homophobia . Itâs an old-fashioned way of talking about gay men, to indicate theyâre not . . . strong. So, that part is really painful. And I have to say, itâs really surprising. He canât get his way, so he resorts to name-calling.â   urlLink Eleanor Smeal  of the  urlLink Feminist Majority  (a national womenâs rights organization), states, â. . . To denigrate half the human race is pretty sick. But thatâs what [Schwarzenegger] is doing. Heâs trying to denigrate the males by denigrating females.â Assemblywoman  urlLink Sarah Reyes  (D-Fresno) thinks Schwarzenegger âshould apologize and think twice before he speaks; and I would hope that his wife,  urlLink Maria , would remind him of that.â (This makes me  urlLink    smile, because Reyes hides behind the  urlLink social progressivism  of  urlLink feminism  while, at the same time, admonishing the Governor through his wife?) I wonât, though, speak on feminism,  urlLink sexism , homophobia, or whether or not a Hollywood action hero should be in office. These topics are interesting, but Iâm not in the mood to say much about them. Suffice it to say, Iâve faced my own homophobia, retain feminist friends (and a few enemies, like us all), think  urlLink gender stereotyping  is wrong, etc. And I also know good rhetorical tactics when I see them.    urlLink   What I really want to proclaim is how brilliant the use of the term â urlLink Girlie Men â was on Arnoldâs part. (And, letâs face it, the  Terminator  planned it -- using it twice. His wife, Maria Shriver, no doubt knew he intended to use the phrase. It remains to be seen whether or not Maria will rebuff her buff hubby for his etymological taste.) The term âGirlie Man,â for those young enough to know (or old enough to remember), came to the public ear from the hilarious   urlLink Saturday Night Live   âHans and Franzâ skits performed by  urlLink Dana Carvey  and  urlLink Kevin Nealon  to spoof bodybuilders,  urlLink infomercials , and people as big as Schwarzenegger. Carvey and Nealon pretended to motivate their viewers, called each slacker âGirlie Menâ as well as âsissies,â used fake Romanian accents and shouted, âWe want to -- PUMP - YOU - UP!!â    urlLink    The genius of Schwarzenegger utilizing âGirlie Menâ as a back-slap to vex the slow-poke CA senate is: on the one hand, everyone knows heâs calling them  urlLink WIMPY  (using a vernacular jest) yet on the other, even if the phrase has a slight (or not-so-slight)  homophobic sense , people remember Schwarzenegger enduring the same abuse. During the time of the sketches, the Cyberdyne Star didnât get uptight or stave off Carvey or Nealon. He went on  Saturday Night Live  and joined in the fun, making light of the general myopism of  urlLink bodybuilding  and the low-brow side of infomercials, relishing in his own self-deprecation.    urlLink   What a sly choice of his to use âGirlie Menâ -- for it was sure to get headlines,  urlLink hullaballoo , make his point, and remind people of his Hollywood clout, all in one swoop! Feminists can fume and clamor, but the public at large generally accepts the epigram as an alternative to âwimpinessâ for the precise reason that itâs descriptive, funny, and chic. Iâll venture to say, weâll be hearing a ping-pong pejorative like âGirliemen  Women â soon enough, so nobody should feel left out. (I doubt the pundits have the courage to coin something like â Boy Dame ,â however.) In the twenty-first century, the ability to chuckle at yourself -- and your interests -- far outshines your dogedness at political correctness.   I  really  would have loved to have been in the meeting in which Schwarzenegger asked for opinions on his phraseology! No offense, Ms. Kuehl, but the strategists in the room decided âGirlie Menâ didnât refer to homosexuals, but instead, stood as a fresh way to heighten gubernatorial visibility and wield  Arnold  power. It was their âlead-sausageâ (and stop the  hee-heeâs ). Theyâll prove right in the end.

      An old spiritual question -- and a question Iâve been personally asking God the entire year (by  God , I donât mean the deity of a specific religion, but the God  urlLink   of  My  Life; I call him âFatherâ) -- goes: âHow much of our energy and action, God,should come from  us  (i.e., from our wills) and how much from  You ?â There are helpful and not-so-helpful theories on this. A Christian phrase says, â urlLink Let go and let God ;â another, in Spanish, hints similarly, âVia con Dios,â or â Go with God .â In the  urlLink idiosyncratic  U.S., the apt but certainly off-kilter maxim is: â urlLink God helps those who help themselves .â     This last attempts -- as it fails -- to crack a conundrum inside âIt all must be of Godâ -- to wit, if itâs  ALL  God, why do we have to get up in the morning?  God helps those who help themselves  says  we  have responsibilities. Doesnât God involve himself only with souls that are attempting to fully LIVE a life and not hiding under a rock? (Generally; but  urlLink consider Jonah . God, at times, gets quite involved with some of his hiding sheep.) But why canât it be ALL him? I admire the Chinese mystical idea in this context offered by  urlLink Lao Tsu : âI do nothing and nothing is left undone.â It subtly hints at Spiritâs efficacy and sums up the Chinese way of thinking about heaven.  urlLink Lao Tsu  would interpret it: â urlLink You know when youâre getting Heavenâs aidwhen things  actually get done  â and  yet   you have no pride or ownership of result  .â Easy to say; very, very hard to do. . . .   For me, the last three months have felt like a four-credit intensive course in learning how to do nothing (and trusting the right things will get done, anyway). Iâve come to see I often go off pursuing the next thing, or job, or project, or woman, or âLife Experienceâ without waiting for God to initiate, and things soon groan to a rusty stop. Iâm constantly picking up pieces and trying to undo  urlLink   problems caused by my rushing and forcing things instead of waiting for (and going with) God.   Last month was especially peaceful because I went to Him each day and said, â urlLink Father, I trust you. Bring me what you would; put the right thing into my heart. â It seemed to work. Iâve been looking for a job, and Iâve done so calmly and without investment in getting anything particular. Iâve not allowed myself to charm or manipulate (even with subtle forms of charm, the kind we often use) to get opportunities. Now, so far I havenât found work. But importantly, I havenât got the  wrong  job, either, which is something that hasnât always been the case. For now, Iâm  on hold , stuck in  urlLink geosynchronous orbit  until God directs me to act.   Things like a new mattress and box spring have come which I didnât even know I needed until I came to understand Iâd been suffering from  urlLink sleep deprivation  for a year. I have three friends coming at the end of the month to visit, and Iâve worried Iâll be poor as Jobâs turkey or will have just begun employment when they come and wonât have much time. (Does the reader see the pointlessness of my concern?)    urlLink    A small plug for  urlLink Mysticism  and Iâll close: All of this assumes a certain  urlLink anthropomorphic , person-like God or Spirit that  truly cares . The âborn-againâsâ words about having a  personal relationship  with God are for the most part right, even if their ideas are confused with with  urlLink legalism , shame, and anger. Trusting that the Father truly cares is key: that he watches over us, and above wanting to give acclaim or riches, desires for us to learn to trust.  âHow much should action come from us?â Our most important act is TRUST. Our contribution is admitting we need God and little else.Blessingscome (more often than we know), but we have to overcome fear and our misunderstandings, like thinking God âfailed us,â and reach upward -- as a child would -- letting Spirit  do , letting heaven fill out our calendars, give us friends, jobs, money, or success as seen fit. The Father knows what we need. âAll things shall be added if we  urlLink seek the Kingdom first ,â said his beloved. Itâs lifeâs purpose, the  raison dâetre  of âExperiment Earthâ-- to learn this. When weâve mastered it, we graduate, floating on to a new curriculum.     Note on Post Title: Chaucer in   Troilus and Criseyde   said:  âMaketh virtue of necessite!â  The phrase suggests, if things get beyond control, thereâs no sense in getting frustrated -- instead, relax and use a bad situation productively. (Courtesy of the   urlLink Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, 2nd Ed . ).

      I work on Blogs most of the weekend. I get this Blog, âMystic Bear Glow,â in shape, adding new graphics. I also develop a Blog for the  urlLink Writersâ Group  and blog a poem, too -  urlLink The Lioness . urlLink     urlLink Mr. Worth  gives me a full-size mattress and box spring on Saturday afternoon. Itâs a âSplendor OrthoTonic,â extra-long (made by  urlLink ResTonic ) and it dates to the 70s. Side-note: itâs a good bed forthe writer or grammarian, for there are  urlLink orthotonic pronouns  in languages such as Greek. âOrthoâ means straight. âTonic,â or -tonia, in the context of bedding, refers to âmuscle or nerve tension,â so OrthoTonic means a bed that âstraightens out muscle tension.â (Apparently, the bed has quite a history in Nathanâs family.) See below for bed improvements.   A friend comes over and we watch the DVD of  urlLink Last of the Dogmen . Itâs quite good; it came out in 1995 and I missed it then -- it has  urlLink Tom Berenger  and  urlLink Barbara Hershey , whom deliver good performances. What surprised me was its â urlLink Dances-with-Wolves â (1990) theme, set in modern times. Today, I skip church and Blog. My roommate kindly drives me over to Jerryâs Home Improvement,  urlLink   where I buy a sheet of  urlLink Oriented Strandboard  for $12  change. The board will go between the mattress and box spring to add a little firmness. I buy sheets and a pillowcase at the  urlLink Goodwill  (they are remarkably inexpensive, colorful, and clean), after buying something else at Bed, Bath,  Beyond; the latter I return for a refund. The fitted-mattress sheets, maroon in color, are the non-iron type.  I have a chat with my friend, Todd, and an even longer talk with Bill Stott -- back in Austin from  urlLink Santiago, Chile  for part of the summer. He sounds good. (I enjoy talking too with his daughter, Molly earlier, who had babysat for Hannah and is  urlLink   now in her 30s.) I have a few false starts talking with Kat, my soul-friend moved recently to  urlLink Treasure Island , Florida (part of St. Petersburg). Sheâs my artist comrade who keeps me laughing, creating, and believing. I try a few minutes of the TV movie  urlLink Catch a Fallen Star , because I have the hots for  urlLink Sela Ward , but even sheâs not enough to keep me from my Blogs!

       urlLink    Who knew a morning could start so beautifully? 8:30, cool, sunlight coming down from my east window and onto my small futon. Iâm relaxed, well-rested, and happy. My roommate and I exchange pleasantries, offering each other the bathroom first. After checking email, Iâm off to the  urlLink Keystone Cafe  for coffee, oatmeal, and a side of blueberries. I have my Superman T-shirt on, and I catch people smiling in a âheâs-got-gutsâ way. I read Lois Wadsworthâs  urlLink review of Spiderman 2  while waiting to eat. She says she didnât like its violence. I didnât feel the movie was too violent but then look mostly for story (it was, in my view and as Roger Ebert said, â urlLink the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with Superman â).    urlLink   I spend the rest of the morning reading around the apartment. I enjoy a story in  urlLink Gunnâs anthology  of British Sci Fi (âDreams are Sacred,â by Peter Phillips, 1948 -- probably the first story in which someone visits anotherâs dreams with dire consequences.) Also, I read a  urlLink Ballard  story in the  urlLink Interzone anthology  {which contains the Amazon review of mine of that anthology} and (almost) finish Nivenâs  urlLink Ringworld  (1970). Ringworld is much slower than Iâd hoped, but Iâm almost through. At the bank, the young Russian girl is sweet, as usual. She doesnât mess my transaction up; I think sheâs decided Iâm not dangerous. I shop  urlLink   at the  urlLink Red Apple , my usual grocery place, and buy the new  urlLink lower-sugar Quaker  Brown-Sugar oatmeal. On the way home, I wait a while while a train goes by. I think about life and how everythingâs perfect, and what Iâm going to say during the menâs retreat in three weeks. I will try to have the words come directly from God, the only words of any value anyway.  urlLink Writersâ Group  meets at the park. We distinguish between the short story and novel format. Amy has a good start to a story. I read my poem, urlLink The Lioness , and we discuss its problems,  urlLink   strengths. Sharon discusses Ian Watsonâs  urlLink Mockymen  (2003), which sheâs enjoying. We read a few passages from Henry Millerâs  urlLink Tropic of Capricorn . Then I finish by reading a short part of  urlLink Rust Hillsâ book on short story . I feel like I do too much of the talking, though most of it is reading to the group. Iâm flattered they like my reading voice and will keep trying to please them.  I watch the Directorâs Cut of the movie  urlLink The Butterfly Effect . I was amazed. It was so much better than expected -- brilliant writing. (A warning, if you havenât seen it:Watch the Directorâs Cut first. It has an entirely different (and better) ending than the theatrical version. True science fiction vs. Hollywood hack.)    My landlord calls during the movie. He and I will meet. I have rent mostly together. Before going to bed, I write my first blog entry.
