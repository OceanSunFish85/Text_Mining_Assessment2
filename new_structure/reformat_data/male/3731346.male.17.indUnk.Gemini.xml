      Howdy everybody,   The end of the month has arrived.  It's time to reflect on all the things that have crowded my funny little brain, me thinks.    This month, I turned seventeen for the first time.  The greatest thing about lots of relatives is, of course, lots of money.  I know, that's a very shallow comment, but what the hey.  I bought two things: a minidisc player and a kite board.  The latter of the two, well, you know the outcome of that (see 'Zoom! Woah! Thud! Ow!').  The minidisc has however further enhanced my passion for music.  There are two things you need to fully enjoy music: Groucho's Music Exchange and a player that fits in your pocket.  It's so good!  If you ever see someone walking down the street, then suddenly bursting into song, it's probably me.  Don't worry, the psychiatrist says it's just a side effect...    Sixth Year has now started, we now rule the roost!  Mwa ha ha ha ha!  Unfortunately, the Neds have multiplied.  It's really quite frightening how this lower species breed at twice the speed and at half the age.  If this continues, it will be inevitable that Neds shall inherit the Earth!  Just watch out, the Burbary flag will soon start flying...  My Duke of Edinburgh Gold Group went on a practice expedition with four boats, and returned with three.  Stay tuned for the full story when I finish my qualifying report and I will post the final version with all the boring bits taken out.    What have I learnt over the month?  Hmm, I did find out that Shakespeare wrote 'nothing' when he actually meant 'gay sex'.  Surely not in every play, or this is how King Lear would read:  LEAR - What is it you want?  CORDELIA - Gay Sex, my lord.   LEAR - Gay sex will come of Gay Sex.   He also meant 'nunnery' to mean 'brothel'.  I apologise, that was quite a seedy little bit there.    Questions I'd like answered for the coming month are: Why do cyclists' farts travel with them? Will there ever be a Dark Place DVD? Does Mrs.Adamson wear anything else other than a blue suit?  If you have any of these answers, please make a comment and tell me (except the last question, it's just too frightening a concept!).    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy Everybody,   Your good friend Mr. T the Messiah is distressed once again by the ever changing landscape that was once my childhood.  On a recent visit to the play park that I spent many a time during my youth.  The Woodies, as we used to call it, wasnât your average park.  Each plaything was everything youâd expect, except it had that little extra.  It had the biggest slide youâd ever seen, the fastest roundabout thereâd ever been and a bucking horse that was really, really mean (see, Iâm a poet and I donât realise it).    To play on these things was to feel like one of the lost boys.  Under the towering forest, we kids could play freely, without a care about whether what we were doing was safe or not.  To climb the heights of the climbing frame was, for a seven year old at least, one of the scariest things in life.  The roundabout was my favourite though.  Getting it going so fast it was sickening, and then leaning as far out as possible was simply exhilarating.    However, you go down to the woods today, youâre in for a big surprise (sorry, I couldnât help it).  The exciting attractions of the Woodies have under gone some major rejiggering.  The huge slide is now a puny wee thing.  The bucking horse is now a (hmm, what rhymes with âbuckingâ?) boring rocket thing.  The large swings are now freakishly small.  The speeding roundaboutâs replacement has a top speed of 4mph.  The climbing frame is gone, no replacement.  They have virtually stripped away my childhood.    âWhy have they done such a thing?â I hear you cry.  The answer is the publicâs new found fear of their kids getting grazed knees.  They donât care about the need for kids to grow up with some illusion of danger; otherwise, they will never learn what is safe or not for themselves.  Our generation seem to be the last to be unaffected by these absurd laws imposed by the paranoid public.  It is up to us to destroy these idiotic ideals when the time comes for us to teach our next generation.    For those of you who read the 2004 English paper on paranoid parenting, you might remember being told that we do not know what it is like to cycle without the aid of a helmet, so that there is no way to feel the wind in our hair.  Well, you know what your rebellious Mr. T did?  Yes, thatâs right; I went for a ride without a helmet.  Shock horror!  Ha, thatâll show themâ¦  Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy Everybody,   I have been counting down for weeks now until the new Thunderbirds movie, awaiting the arrival of the moment I would see those fantastic rockets blast off in full live-action pizzazz.  That is until I read the recent reviews.  Terrible they say.  Performance as wooden as the puppets (I made that one up myself).  This canât be.  Could they really have slaughtered the all-out fun of Supermarionation?    Let me tell you a bit about my childhood.  I went through many crazes, Mighty Morphinâ Power Rangers (the original posse up until the movie), PokÃ©mon (just the Gameboy and Card games â no merchandise, honest) and Mighty Max (think the boyâs âPolly Pocketâ but with more snakes and things that kill evil girls).    There were three shows that strangely, I am proud to admit still loving: Captain Scarlet, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and Thunderbirds.  I still love them to this day.  Captain Scarlet always made me feel a bit more grown up â Captain Scarlet was like James Dean or some sort of mythical film star, but exclusively for nine year olds (which, incidentally, is my mental age now).  The turtles were groovy, they were hip, and theyâd got it going on.  I was slightly distressed when they changed the name for the next generation to Ninja Turtles.  They were only copying the filmâs name not the originals.  The one advantage is that with the new range of turtle toys, I got a Donatello Turtle figure for Christmas.  How, ahem, cool is that?    My first love was however, Thunderbirds.  Yes, I did make the Blue Peter Tracy Island (I used real sand and rocks instead of newspaper though) and no, I didnât have a Thunderbirds costume (I had a Captain Scarlet one).  It was amazing!  My favourite was T-bird 4âs Gordon Tracy, but the green T-bird 2 was the coolest ship.  My friend David bought a ârealâ Tracy Island â the rich git.  No matter how jealous I was of the sound effects and collapsing trees though, he didnât have real rocks and sand, did he?    You can see how distressed I am then, to hear that the Movie will be an equivalent to a Spy Kids sequel (I enjoyed Spy Kids, the sequels were pants).  Apparently, it focuses on the youngest, lesser-liked Thunderbird, Alan, while all my favourites such as Virgil, Scott and of course, Gordon.  There are only two things Iâm looking forward to in this film.  The first is Lady Penelope, the only wooden puppet I ever fancied, and the on-screen version is so hot it hurts.  Then thereâs Parker, with a face like Steve Buscemi and a quiet wit.  Maybe the film wonât be so bad after allâ¦  Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy Everybody,   My friend and I were having a hearty discussion the other day in the middle of English about the merits of Finding Nemo.  Being the highest grossing animation in cinema history, we debated most mightily over how good a film it actually was.    It is a strong belief of mine that Finding Nemo was made for Teenagers+ rather than the kiddie-winkles.  Thatâs my excuse anyway.  It was a reminiscence of the days when we didnât feel embarrassed to like Disney films, a time when films could be colourful and playful, and still be cool.    Letâs look at two examples â the Lion King and Toy Story.  Until we found Nemo, Lion King was the highest grossing animation.  It had the musical, a stellar cast, a terrifying villain not seen since Aladdin, and it had the comedy duo to pierce the sentiment with biting wit.  Not only that, but the main characterâs dad dies, not unlike Bambi.  How could Nemo rival this?  Its secret lay in the way we could relate to the characters, not only as far as plot, but their background too.  Lion King showed the Disney Generation a, dare I say it, Shakespearean tragedy (okay there was a happy ending, but returning to his kingdom too late must be Shakespeare).  Nemo, however, gave us characters with flaws, flaws that affect the plot, much like Macbeth and Othello et al.  Sure, Aladdin had a character called Iago, but he was one of the most annoying talking animals in film.    The comparisons with Toy Story are trickier.  To line the two together, we can easily see how CGI has progressed dramatically to reveal an aesthetically stunning landscape.  Toy story was fresh, the new kid on the block, here to teach Uncle Walt a lesson.  To an extent, it worked, a whole new threat to traditional 2D animation had arrived (Disneyâs next animation is reportedly their final venture into 2D).  As well as that, it was the first time in years that the token comedy duo were now the protagonists.  What it failed to do was create a completely fresh perspective; we were still seeing the overly-sentimental stuff parading about the screen.  Disney had such an effect on animation, that every new story seemed to demand a moral.  I know what your thinking; youâre thinking that I have pretty much summed up Nemoâs narrative.  Well perhaps, but I strongly believe that Nemo had more sentiment than sentimentality.  Also, the moral wasnât so clean cut, it depended on your perspective.  For parents, it could have been to stop worrying; for kids, it might have been to listen to your parents.  It was a narrative to which we could all relate.    In the end, I believe that it is not the quantity of the gags, or indeed the quantity, but the characters themselves.  How many of us left the pictures reciting actual spoken lines in the film?  Not that many.  Instead, we all left with the essence of the characters; I for one, havenât managed to stop saying âDudeâ in the Crush and Squirt way.  Neither have I managed to get through the day without speaking whale to my fellow cohorts.  Character definition alone made the film for me.  They are the ones that made this film both the tear-jerkingly saddest  and all-out funniest film of 2003.  Pixar, I salute you.  I just canât wait for the next Pixar film (and incidentally, their last with Disney) âThe Incrediblesâ.    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   Despite finishing a month ago, I am still being asked my exams went.  The interrogators tend to be old people and people that havenât seen me since I was yay high.  I have come to realise that this conversation piece has taken over the weather as Britainâs favourite conversation piece.   	 We are asked this because the antagonist canât think of anything interesting to say.  Sure, there are the odd snippets of intrigue at the start, but itâs followed by a silence, an extremely uncomfortable pause, then a sigh, and then if your lucky, an âah, wellâ for no other reason to break the pause.  Then cometh the question.  For the first seven times, I tried to vary my answer, but after the twenty-seventh time, Iâm afraid I canât be assed.  There are only so many times I can explain how most of them went fine, and no, I couldnât possibly say how I did because I donât know the answers.    I have learnt one thing though.  Never tell an old person that Study Leave is practically skiving.  Oh, the lecture I got from my Nana.  She was already pretty pissed that I had decided not to carry both the Sciences AND Maths.  For her, they are the ones that will get you places, to make a name for yourself.  Then these words slipped out, âOut of the month of Study Leave we had, I probably studied for a week.â  Can you feel me cringing as I type this?    However, I got over her disappointment with me.  At the time I was too annoyed by her other old person words.  Almost every time I see her, she says: âOoh, your stretching again, my wee Messiah is getting really tall.â  What do you say to that?  Thank you, I grew me myself?  How about; âThat reminds me, I must thank Dad again for that gene he passed down.â    The truth is I am actually quite small for my age.  Officially, Iâm below average, but that just means that everyone else is abnormally tall.  Which suits me fine, I donât care about needing to be taller than everyone younger than me.  Honest.  What does get me however is how my family goes on about how tall I am.  My family are tiny.  I have now outgrown everyone on my Mumâs side, and I equal those on my Dadâs.    Perhaps it is only my Grandparents way of getting at me.  They have had a mould Iâve had to fit since a child.  When I said I wanted to work in the film industry, they laughed.  No joke.  When I chose my standard grades, I actually decided to be an architect, because I thought my original idea was just silly.  As I neared the end of Primary School, they constantly told me I was getting a bit too fat for a kid my age.  Okay, maybe I was (which I have got rid of now) but hey didnât have to tell me that.  That sort of thing is mentally scarring for a kid that was beginning to contemplate the mystery of girls, not to mention the screwed up concept called âgrowing upâ, I was already feeling very self-conscious.    Oh dear, that turned into quite a rant, didnât it?  What was I saying again?    Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy Everybody,   As promised, I have been searching through the secrets of Human Instinct.  Like the paperclips, this theory also stems from the mundane life of stationary â stamps.    We drown them in ink so that we can print DRAFT COPY, CONFIDENTIAL, and what have you.  However, we donât just press them down on the paper with no emotion, no feeling.  Oh no, we want to slam it down on that paper, regardless of how lightly we actually need to.  The passion, the anger, the vigour we feel as we push it down, further down, regardless of whether itâll go further or not, is so strong that our primal instincts couldnât be more visible.    Itâs all about our need to feel supreme, a display of showing our authority over that bit of paper, going mediaeval on its ass.  Again, like the paperclips, itâs about killing small, harmless and presumably innocent animals.  Where our ancestors had clubs, we have stamps.    The next time you have to do some paperwork, you show it who the superior being is.    Until next time, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   Take a look at http://scotland.ideasfactory.com/dundee/ideasfactory_live/ and look for Gordon Strachan.  Its a channel 4 thing, all of them are groovy, but some are more groovier than others.    Today, I had a nasty kite boarding crash.  I was speeding along the beach at about 25 mph (no joke).  The wind was in my hair, and everything was peachy.  I was speeding up, and began to ponder whether I should slow down, just in case I have an accident.  As I pondered, I failed to noticed the wee hole some kid had dug.  The board got caught, I lost my balance and I went flying.  I landed head first before tumbling in some odd formation (I thing I kicked myself in the face...) before coming to a stop 10 metres from the hole.  I shudder as I write this.    Well, I lay there, my head swimming, I couldn't stand up, I couldn't sit up.  I lay there, waiting for some of my friends to come over, like, you know, to confirm if I was alive.  I lay there...and layed some more.  It turned out they were to busy digging a hole themselves.  They'd even bought spades.  Ho hum.  (It was a mightily impressive hole).    When I finally stood up, I fell down again.  As I write this, my legs are still in utter agony (I have a perfectly square bruise in quite an intimate place) as well as my arms being scratched all over.  However, it's my head that is a spectacular sight.  I know have the largest bump on my forehead, with three deep gashes adorning this bump (I'm not quite sure how I can cut my head on sand.  Not only that, but I now have no feeling in my nose (which makes for interesting sneezing).    I had to get a bus home almost immediately afterwards; oh you should have seen the funny looks I got from old ladies and small children.  How I chuckled.    I hope I haven't put you off Kite Boarding, because it is one of the most exhilarating things you can do.  It may be a good idea to wear a helmet though.    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everbody, the moment you have been waiting for has arrived.  Yes, the concluding episode to the enthralling story is here.  If you want to read the first part (always a good idea) go to my good friend siouxsie's site, mysoulbringstears.blogspot.com - Without further ado, here it is, ENJOY!:  Hearing the almighty KABLOEY!! Duncan ran into the ferret settlement as several thousand ferrets ran in the opposite direction, some riding on the backs of others and squealing quite perversely. He entered the large clearing â a large plane crash. Crumpled on the ground lay a 27-year-old man. Duncan knew he was a Rock Star because of his glowing manly-parts.   "Hello there, Iâm afraid Iâm quite lost, are you the tour guide?" smiled a small cat.  Meanwhile, three miles off the coast, a rogue pirate named Lawrence of Cornwall was enjoying an impromptu meal of beans on ferret. He had been pelted with the things after the plane had crashed.   "AARGH!!" Even Lawrence heard the amazed, slightly scared, and a little flabbergasted cry that reverberated around the island.   Duncan ran, quivering, away from the talking cat, who, much to Duncan's consternation, followed calmly, chatting to himself in a very posh English accent,   "â¦ Any English muffins? That stupid âRock Starâ didnât even have the decency to eat properly himself, never mind feed me wellâ¦"   Eventually, his natural curiosity (and inherently short boredom thresholds) led him to converse with the catâ¦  The unfortunate (and partially forgotten in this tale) Rock Star had, sadly, dropped dead (or deader than he was when last we saw him, I supposeâ¦) as a consequence of his radiation poisoning. The same radiation poisoning that allowed that cat to vent on a human being, for better or worse.   Just then, in events that conveniently wrap up the story, little man Duncan and his befriended talking cat left Ferret Island (how? well, that would be a story in its own rightâ¦) for a Christmas holiday in Ukraine. They walked into the sunset, and their struggle against the cruel, uncaring world began.   ---  How groovy is that?  This ultimate groovyness was brought to you by the powerhouse that is the collective Brain of Mr.T the Messiah, Siouxsie, and Alex during a moost excellant creative writing session.    Until then, thats all folks!

      Lately, I have been pondering over the deeper thought processes surrounding paperclips.  You may think it mad, but let yourself ponder for one second.  What is everyoneâs initial reaction when they pick up a paperclip?  No, itâs not âHmm, I wonder what pieces of paper I could clip together with this?â  Oh no, they think âOoh, a paperclip!  I just have to unbend it into a perfectly straight line!â    Well, I believe I have discovered the reason for this strange and sordid affair.  Itâs all down to our natural instinct to hunt.  Humans are very resourceful creatures, and when we find some harmless object that can be converted into a vicious, scary looking weapon, we just canât help but shout âHa, letâs go kill some innocent creatureâ.  Iâm telling you, weâre all like thatâ¦arenât we?    The next time you find a paperclip, time how long you can suppress your natural urge to create a simple, spear-like killing machine.  My record is 42 seconds.  The restraining order still stands.    If you have any experiences of embracing your natural urges (well, not those ones), tell me about them.  Have you ever felt like eating a Vegetarian to see if they taste different, or have you possibly sniffed someoneâs arse to break the iceâ¦Anyone?  Thatâs just me again then?    Until next time, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy,   I am in the process of creating a manifesto for my cult.  My first motion is to ressurrect the word 'groovy'.  Too long now has the world shunned this word, thinking it no better than a product of the seventies.  In its current form, 'groovy' can't shake off its frankly cheesy persona.  No one can stop them selves from saying it in any other way than "yeah, that's groovy baby" in that Austin Powers voice.    Well, thats going to change.  I propose that we eradicate the word 'cool', a word with as much meaning as 'nice'.  Its a placid, luke warm word, that is only used as mere teenage slang.  Groovy has the right emotion, the perfect oomph, an added something, that just gets your feelings across.  Not to mention the fact that its a happy word - come on say it to yourself: GROOVY!  See your smiling aren't you?    On another note, I noticed the comments on the previous post.  I'm glad you've noticed me so quickly, but I noticed how they were all done within the space of 5 minutes (hmm, I'm sensing a Schizophrenic in the house).  Oh well, more the merrier.  If you have any thoughts on the remolding of the language, feel free to comment.  Mr.T the Messiah wants you!  While I'm at it, I seriously recommend that you visit my very good friend's very own blog.  It's mysoulbringstears.blogspot.com - I know, it sounds so sad, but its really groovy (her words are extremely poetic, and if your a teenager, every word will hit a chord).  Also, we'll be doing an exclusive link up story time.  Visit her site first to read part 1 and then on Friday, I will publish the concluding episode.    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   this is the place to be, the only place to be, where you can delve into the depths of my mind.  I am your host, Mr.T the Messiah, the man responsible for what should be an earth quaking and ground breaking experience for the whole world to behold.  Just in case you haven't realised yet, I am not actually the Mr.T of A-Team and Rocky 3 fame (so don't sue me), although I strongly believe in using the term: "I pity the foo".  Oh I chuckle at the thought.    As for the Messiah bit, well that's up to you if you want to praise me (hey, who knows).  I don't actually believe in all that religious stuff (so that does leave space for a whole new cult thing on this site - hmm, maybe I should come up with a manifesto).  I'm not the most politically minded person (ha, an understatement if ever there was one) but I do have friends that make me believe that I do know, like, you know, stuff.    My specialty is film.  I am a complete and utter film buff and have been since birth.  I watch anything and everything.  Therefore, I will try to write up some reviews of films I've seen, new and old, whether anyone cares or not.  Watch this space...  Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   So the end of the month has once again. What does this mean as we move into August? It means that we are going to be 1.5 times less productive. Think about it. July is the second easiest month to write (next to June which is easier to spell), but when next month arrives, we have an extra two letters to write or pronounce. Jeez, who said life was easy... I feel quite ashamed that I haven't maintained my Cult Leader Stature as well as last month. I haven't reintroduced many words to the world since groovy. However, I am proud of two of my disciples Siouxsie and Louise, who came up with some words of their own, all of which you can see by clicking on 'Match boy and Stick Girl in Love' on the blog roll. My favourite is indeedibly, which I have used in conversation (allbeit accidentally). I haveoffered brain-flattening as opposed to mind-numbing, but flattening is a tiring word to say.   In the coming month, I will add to the 'Mr.T Manifesto'. As well as this, I was thinking about making some changes. First up, I think I'll re-jigger my profile, then the introduction note at the top of the page. The next step is to jazz up a regular occurance on my posts. I am getting tired of writing: "Until then, that's all folks!" It has dated quickly and often doesn't fit what I'm trying to say.   Here's what I propose; I am opening this up for debate. What do you want me to say in place of it. This 'competition' will stay open for as long as I feel, and when I find one I like, the winner gets to pick a subject of their choice for me to write a post on. Make it inventive, after all, your the one's who'll be reading it.   Until the - oh yeah, I forgot...

      Howdy everybody,   I've just been on a quiz site that is on the whole a boring affair but there were some interesting titbits. Basically it is supposed to tell you who you really are by determining what things you relate to. Think 'If you were a tree, what one would you be', that kind of thing.   Anyway, a lot of them I didn't agree with, such as my inner child is supposedly 16 years old, which is a load of nonesense as I have a certified mental age of athree year old golden retriever. Also, the genre of music I am most like is apparantly Garage rock. Damn those cretins! I wanna be Indie, dagnabbit!   Here are the two that I either particularly liked, or chuckled most heartily at.   The first one is  urlLink 'What Movie Do You belong in? '. And the answer is:     In case you can't read that:  With a courageous look on life, you are sometimes corney and live off of big events. Making longtime friends is hard for you to do, but the ones you have are golden.    See that, I may be incapable of making new friends, which means I'm absolutely buggered since I'm only seventeen, but at least all of you lot are made of a valuable metal.   The next one filled me with a mixture of smugness and bewilderment. The quiz was ' urlLink What Greek God are You? '. And the answer is:     Even if you can read that, I'm on a little ego trip:  You are like the Greek God or Goddess of Love. You firmly believe in soulmates, in caring for each other and ultimately staying true to your life partner. You've either found or are looking for "The One" for you. Romantic, kind, generous and always loving - you have a beauty that is inexplicable bothinside and out.    I was hoping for Zeus, but at least with this one, it'll give Keir a good laugh!   I also tried 'What kind of Girl are You' and came up with a tomboy, so I think that's a good thing, being a guy and all...   Give them a go and tell me what ones you are.   Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   I have finally got my photos back from the shop. At this point I can hear you scream: "What photos? You didn't tell us about any photos, Mr.T? Oh why do you mock us!" To which I reply: "Calm down, it's a commercial!" Oh how I chuckle.   What I am talking about are the photos of both my camping adventure at Tentsmuir Forest ( urlLink Survival, lazy-man style ) and my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Expedition ( urlLink The Duke And I ). I thought that since I shared my experiences with you in the past, it was only fair you got to actually see my favourites.   Before I proceed, can I just say to any of you that feature in the pictures that if you're at all unhappy with being posted online, just comment and I'll be happy to censor the photos. Phew, that's all the legalities out of the way, let's go...   First up is theDofE trip. There are two snapshots that I think stood out from the rest. There were others but for those of you who don't no my DofE buddies, they won't mean much to you. This is half of the group at Loch Morlich, under Cairn Gorm. I'm the one being 'attacked' by my canoeing buddy, Heather. To the right are Krystin and Nick.   urlLink     Having spent the entire evening at the beach, we got to witness one of the best sunsets I've seen in ages. Please note the 'budding photographer' factor of the next photo...   urlLink      Onto the Tentsmuir camp. This is Davey on the left, me on the right. Yes, I realise I am sporting anunashamedly cheesy pose.   urlLink     Woah, Davey! It's not thatkind of photo. Dave, no Dave! I've told you before,I'm not that kinda guy! (Note: Your good ol' Mr.T was spared. Dave claimed that his finger was inexpicably caught in his boxers when he was...he never finished his excuse and ran into the forest, howling with manic laughter)   urlLink     Conor, Davus and Mr.T: the masters of campfires. At this point, we were a bit worried by Conor, who could not blink due to an overdose of Marshmallows among other things.   urlLink      So there you have it, that's just part of what I've been doing with the summer. What has Keir been doing though. Well, to scared to go outside of his hut in the middle of South Carolina, purely because of his political fear of the bible belt and his xenophobic tendancies towards Americans, he has been making some new friends...   urlLink    Sorry, that was uncalled for...  Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   I am not a happy bunny. Quite the contrary in fact. I am a pissed off wee bunny.   urlLink      For a while, I have been concerned by the absence of my good friend Davey from my site. In the early days of the blog, Davey was a regular commentator for all my posts. Oh how we would laugh at his irrelevant and more often than not 'that's-just-silly' points. Then one day, Davey was eaten by the washing machine and shrunk to the size of a squirrels nuts!   Alright, I made that last bit up. What really happened was that Davey got an attack of superiority and decided that I was spelling 'Memoirs' wrong. All previous knowledge of my version was erased from hismind. From that moment, he began to type in 'memoires', believing it to be the right spelling.   This worried me; had I,Mr.T theMessiah, finally got it wrong? If I was, then not only was my blog wrong, the bleeding address was wrong too! All day, I pondered. Pondering led to worrying, worrying led to fear, fear led to hatred, and hatred led to the dark side. Filled with the power of the Sith, I finally looked up the dictionary.    urlLink      WOOPAH! One-nil to the Messiah! The Collins English Dictionary spelt it my way. Still not content, I consulted the internet. After all, the internet is always right.   HOO HAH! Two-nil! Score! In yo' face Dave! Dictionary.com also bowed to my Messiahaic ways. As well as that, I found out where Davey was going wrong. As it happened, Davey hadn't gone all superior on us, he'd simply turned French. Old French to be precise. The French use the word mÃ©moire which was taken fromYe Olde French...drumroll please...MEMOIRE! Don't believe me?  urlLink Exhibit A  my lord.   Well, in case your worried about Davey, thankfully, he has fully recovered from being French, and has returned to his usual irrelevant self. As well as that, the power of the sith, erm, sorry, the power of the T has influenced him to start his own blog. Hooray! I seriously recommend giving it the once over. It goes by the name of ' urlLink euphoria's the way! ' That's euphoria, E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A...   Until then, that's all folks!

       Howdy Everybody,   The other day it hit me (with considerable force and great pain) that I have neglected to tell you about what I want to be when I 'grow up'. You've heard me go on and on time and time again about films. Well, it turns out that I am a certified cinephile. I love all things cinematic and celluloid-like. Hence the reason I want to be a film Director.   Okay, okay. What with all the talk about Channel 4 and my constant ranting about film references, you've probably guessed my ambition. What you don't know though, is that me and my posse have created a completely independant, so-low-budget-it's-non-existent, fresh and youthful film company. What is it called? None other than:     DRAMATIC GASP! Productions     The name stemmed from my ickle friend James, the most cynical and sarcastic fella you'll ever meet. After hearing about our proposed company, his initial reaction was to do a Home Alone style shocked pose, and shout "Shock! Horror! Dramatic Gasp!" And the name stuck.       In the past, I've gone freelance, and have had premiere's at the local Arthouse cinema (big egotistical  oo oooOO OO OOooo oo h) but I thought it was time to go professional (well, almost).       Admittedly, we've only made one film (Monty Python: A salute!) but the straight-to-video editing was pants. However, now that the group has access to the Drama Department and we are all in a Film Editing Class, the productions will finally get off the ground. Hopefully, when the site gets up and running, I'll get a link to it for the whole world to see.       Until then, that's all folks!

       Howdy everybody,        If you can remember a while back when I mentioned the Channel4's Ideas Factory, I have a little update. First, let me fill you in on the history.     Way back in March, I entered a competition set up by Channel 4 to find the hottest talents in animation (I know,obvious smugness). I had to hand in an idea for a story using only three images. Only twenty ideas would be shortlisted to get through to the next round.     Needless to say, I got through (I'm sorry, I'll stop now) and have been doing a month's worth of workshops to develop my idea to storyboard form. Out of these twenty, only four will go through to get made into actual animations to be... drumroll please...SHOWN ON TELEVISION!!!!     Well, okay, I haven't got that far yet, but my final storyboard has been handed in to be judged now. Here's the exciting bit, though.  Only three of the final four will be chosen by the judges. The fourth is up to you, the public.   Very soon, that power will be given to you, and as everybody knows, with great power comes great responsibility. Vote wisely, and for the one that you believe most deserv - oh screw it...    VOTE FOR ME!!!!!!     urlLink     I hope that blatant canvasing for votes wasobvious enough. All you need to do is wait for the word go from me, the site should be up and ready within the week. Until then, why not have a look through the idea that got picked in the first place  urlLink right here . Just look for Gordon Strachan and remember the name, you'll be putting a tick beside it soon enough. (Sorry, the cockiness stops here).   Tell me what you think of it when you get back!   Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,    While posting on other blogs and what have you, I realised how brain-flatteningly* hard it is to laugh sincerely in text form, the outcome is always mistaken for another sentiment. Let me lead you through a few examples...     Ha ha ha -    the most common error. Leaves the laughee sounding sarcastic or droll.     Tee hee hee -    leaves you sounding like an ickle school girl, or a drunk mouse.     Mwa ha ha -    usually intended for all round evil practices and sinister scheming.    urlLink      I have discovered that it is far easier to describe how your laughing. For instance:     "Oh how I chuckle.I cannot inhale a moment longer as I am on the floor, curled up in pains of joyous laughter."     Unfortunately, this can become a bit to melodramatic and by the time it's been written, you no longer feel the same way, and you end up editing it because it looks over the top to even the laughee. There is a way I've noticed others use to describe their happy noises. They simply use one abbreviation:    LOL = Laugh Out Loud    Okay, it gets the point across, but the reader is left thinking whether their just saying that out of habit or if their actually laughing out loud. Not only this, but it's terribly impersonal and mechanical.     This realisation of the difficulty of internet laughter leaves me with the depression conclusion that the Internet is destined to be an unjoyous desert of fake smiles and polite laughter. You know, the kind that you give to your Gran or Aunty when you've not really been listening but have a horrible feeling that you have to give a reaction. That sort of emotion could consume the internet. Don't let it happen. Try and convince me that we can laugh convincingly online by showing me your best laughs. Come on people, we can do this! Whew, I came over all passionate there...     Until then, that's all folks!      *brain-flattening - the Mr.T Thesaurus' alternative to mind-numbing.

       Howdy everybody,    A few weeks back, I was walking through town when I spotted a girl Iâd met while playing Squash. We didnât know each other very well; in fact, weâd only met once, but I thought it was worth saying hello. As I waved, she paused and looked at me with a blank expression. This did not fill me with confidence. Only after a brief but painful moment did she say: âOh itâs you Mr.T, I didnât recognise you without your glasses on!â    I had the quick realisation that sheâd not seen me without glasses before. Not for the first time has this little detail confused others. This recurring problem has since led me to a theory I like to call:      The Superman/Clark Kent Theorem     Youâve all seen it and probably criticised it. How the hell does Clark Kent manage to fool the citizens of Metropolis using only a pair of glasses as his disguise? Well, I believe it is entirely possible. Glasses become an added distinction to the face. As well as that, if you have particularly snazzy specs, then they begin to become a highlight of the face.      urlLink          Itâs only when you remove the glasses that your face appears to change shape. Youâre eyes are no longer complimented in the same way as before and onlookers begin to notice the other aspects of your face. Take Christopher Reevesâ Superman for example; in Clark Kent mode, the big, bold goggles make his eyes look huge, where as in Superman mode, Reevesâ chiselled jaw becomes that bit more apparent.      This is why people like the girl have trouble noticing the people behind the glasses. Or thatâs what I keep telling myself anywayâ¦    Hereâs a little thought; if the eyes are the windows to the soul, then glasses are they frames. Also, to anyone who asks me if Iâm ever distracted by the rims of the glasses obstructing my vision, the answer is simple: I see everything just the same way as everyone else, but what I see is framed like a pictureâ¦      urlLink      Until then, thatâs all folks!

       Howdy everyone,    I have returned after five days of living like a feral child. Some may argue that there is little change in that department, but to them, I simply blow a harsh raspberry.    I have of course been on my  âDuke of Edinburghâs Award Gold Qualifying Canoeing Expeditionâ  (catchy title, huh?) down the river Spey. A couple of my readers have displayed a stubborn disregard for the activity, particularly Keir who gave up at Bronze because he had withdrawal symptoms after he unplugged his USB port from his arse. Well, I believe that the experience I have had was one of the most enjoyable and memorable experiences Iâve ever had.    At the beginning of Gold, it had become apparent that everyone that annoyed me so much in Silver had given up, which suited me fine. However, there was a fresh bunch of fresh folk, a year older than us, and frankly, a bit scary looking. Very soon though, over all the meetings and practices, I realised that they were pretty decent and friendly scary looking folk.    It turned out that this has been my favourite group out of all the levels. Bronze was okay, but was filled with those eedjits that base their personality solely on their social status i.e. lots of friends = cocky bastards. This lot were groovy, and for veteran readers of this blog, you will know that that is an impressive accolade.    Iâll tell you about the trip a bit more in a future blog, but I just jammed my finger in the chair as I tried to move it (it's one of the pneumatic chairs) so I don't really feel like typing.This is really going to hurt in the morning...   Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   A few minutes ago, I typed âMr.T the Messiahâ into Google search and found that I am the first person they come up with.  In fact, I am the only Mr.T the Messiah there is.  Dude.    Unfortunately, it isnât this site that it has found me, but it is one of the conversations I had on the Duke of Edinburgh website.  I think I was going on about disproving Einsteinâs philosophies.  I have to say that I am impressed.  Out of all the Mr.T parodies and wannabees in the world, I am the only Messianic Mr.T out there.    I then typed in Memoirs of a Madman, but was most distressed.  It turns out there is one other Blogger out of a possible six billion people that has named their blog by the same title.  Hear that? Thatâs me hissing like a pissed off cat.    However, this Blogger has only made one entry since February with little or nothing interesting to say, and is void of all quirkiness.  To see for yourself, visit kaisersose.tblog.com â post a comment and textually abuse him people.  A messiah doesnât ask for much; only that the collective cult should crush all opposition. g Mwa ha ha ha!    I seem do be doing a lot of evil laughing of late; I should see a doctor about thatâ¦  One more thing, I'm away on acanoeing expedition for a week so you'll have to make do without me...

      Howdy everybody,   It has been known for a long time that apparently we're fighting a war on terrorism.  Everything is a threat.  Trust no one.  At the moment, things seem to have calmed down but a few months ago, the country was being forced into a constant state of paranoia.  Well the time has come for the newest threat to national security has arisen.  Here is but one of the dangers:     urlLink     That's right!  We can't trust the kittens!  For years, we have looked at those lethargic creatures and thought: "hmm, their up to something."  Well we were right!    What do we do? How can we help with this threat that lives among us?  The trick is to start teaching the next generation the basics.  It's too late for us but there is hope for our children.  The following is a picture of how we shall strike back (the following picture may offend, not because of content, but because of the sheer ugliness of this baby):     urlLink     With this new litter of terrorists, how is the government cleaning up the old lot.  The solution is a new televised sport called 'Celebrity Terrorist Fishing'.  The premise is simple, family-friendly celebrities join the fight against terror, by throwing out an industrial strength fishing line into the depths of Terrorville.  Here is a screenshot of the show:    urlLink     Trust me to be quirky about something like Terrorism.  Oh, how I chuckle.    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   The other night, me and my family went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  I haad been looking forward to this film.  After such great documentaries as 'Roger and Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine' Michael Moore's next outing was inevitably going to be big.    First of all, here's some information on the film's pre-distribution history.  The film was all set to be sent around the world by Miramax, one of the biggest film companies around.  It's not largely known that Miramax was founded by Disney when Disney decided they wanted to make films for older audiences.  What everyone does know is that Disney is the wholesome, patriotic and all together American company: 'The house of Mouse'.    Obviously, Disney would be buggered if they were going to let Miramax release an anti-Bush film.    The solution: use the 'I'm the boss, so screw you' card on the Weinsteins (heads of Miramax).  The Weinsteins cranked up the cost in a fuss saying that it was so important, so much so that many of the other distributors couldn't touch it.  Eventually, Harvey Weinstein bought it for his own personal distribution company 'Fellowship Adventures'.  Finally, the film could be unleashed on America in time for the start of the election trail...  The film itself is far more daring than any of Moore's previous outings.  Not just for the subject matter but the way he handles it.  For instance, within the first five minutes, the audience is thrown into darkness as we only hear the sounds of 9/11.  Not only does this show artistic flair as a movie-maker, doing away with the scenes we have seen too much, but the horrendous sounds really hits home.  Tough stuff.    Then we cut to George W. playing golf.  It's from this moment that we realise despite the narrative trying to find its way through the questions of 9/11 through to Iraq, this is really a portrait of the president.  The facts about this simple man come thick and fast, from his more than questionable election, to how his family have strong social and financial links with 'the enemy'.      urlLink     Moore's personality is restrained this time round.  In Bowling for Columbine, Moore was the protagonist, he was getting in the way of what he was reporting.  For example, his interview with Charlton Heston could have been far more revealing, but it turned into a piss take and frankly, undignified mockery of the frail man.  Forcing the picture of the dead girl on Heston was unneeded.  In this film, Moore is the narrator, and doesn't need to make fun of Bush, hell, Bush does that all by himself!    This is an excellent film with all the enjoyment of his previous films but also ten times as moving.  The end product is an insightful and fascinating portrayal of George dubya, told with a passion.  Worth all the awards it gets.     Oh, and you'll also leave the cinema with a reinvigorated hatred of Britney Spears!  Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,  It has come to my attention that there are several people in the online community and among my friends that there is something more than friendship between myself and Crazy Lady.  Well, here is the truth.    I have never seen the First Lady of Craziness before and she has never seen me.  Well, at least we aren't aware that we have.  I would still like to think that we are very good honest friends, although a constant visitor of the site called Keir held this theory:   "[She is] a forty-five year old albanian man with long black hair and a spinly body, who has a strange fascination with young boys"   Bare in mind of course that Keir carries the following description (proven, I've seen with my own eyes!):  "Keir is a fifty something mother of seven, has managed to get on the dole despite running her own laungerie shop for gender confused men"  Sickening isn't it?  Anyway, back to the original topic.  Only Crazy Lady and I know the truth, and all you DofE folk can keep on wondering.  Mwa ha ha ha ha.  I thought that as a run-up to showing a real picture of myself, as requested by Ms.Crazy, I thought I would give an artistic impression done on MS Paint...    urlLink     Not the coolest picture but that's all your getting for now...

      Howdy everbody,   The other night, I went camping down at the beach with a couple of friends.  It was one of the most peaceful nights the area had had in ages.  Obviously, we would destroy that by playing the radio full blast.  As we set up the camp, and got the fire going, we turned to Radio 3 (not my usual listening, I assure you).  It turned out we were pleasantly surprised.  A whole night of african jungle music.  It was grooviness of the highest order.  You wouldn't believe how well it fitted in with the surrounding.    Picture the scene; underneath the contorted shapes of the dead trees, we set up the tent.  The radio sat comfortably on one of the branches as we got the fire going just outside of the clearing, but still protected from the wind.  Looking out to sea, there were several sand banks covered in seals, all peacefully lazing in the sun.  As your eyes move to the horizon, the Bellrock lighthouse flashes brightly as the sun sets behind the trees behind us.  Then, out of the silence, the safari beat kicks in and three guys laugh insanely for the rest of the night, as they fill their faces with all the marshmallows, crunch creams, wafers, and several gelatinous products they could consume.    Through the night, there were occasions where the music would go quiet, and during those occasions, we would here thrashing and howling.  You can imagine how that got us just a bit scared - erm, I mean, in the most manly kind of way, of course.  It wasn't wolves though.  It was the seals.  We walked down to the shore and heard the seals thrashing and splashing violently, making the most bone chilling howls you've ever heard.  Screw the friendly arffing they are famous for.    Forgetting about that experience, we sat around the campfire talking about stuff, and pretending to be philosophical.  We never went to sleep at all and ended up cycling back at 7 in the morning.  We'd tried to do some kiting at 4am, but were so shattered that our arms couldn't take it.  Ho hum.    Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   I just saw Shrek 2 and was instantly blown away.  The countless numbers of visual references to other films within the prologue alone reminded us what weâd been missing since the first Shrek.    As far as sequels go, this is the Godfather 2 of animation.  Toy Story 2 was good, but not great; that was more like 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' - not great but entertaining (although lots would argue even that).  Shrek 2 is the only animation that I have seen that could well have surpassed the original.    Previously, I compared Finding Nemo to the classical writings of Shakespeare.  Shrek is something newer and fresher.  It is my strong beliefs that the Shrek films are the equivalent to the Tarantino movies.    First of all, there are the pop culture references and music.  There were the obvious ones such as Lord of the Rings and Spiderman, but the more subtle ideas came thick and fast, like the Alien parody.  The film was also geared for the older audience as well.  Who would have thought that a film maker would include 'Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' track in a family film.  Also, there is a scene involving Pinocchio and women's underwear.  Trust me, you have to see this scene.    You will have heard all the fuss about Puss in Boots, and the truth is it's all true.  He is easily the greatest character in the show.  The zorro-esque cat oozes so much cool that he could well be for shrek 2 what Samuel L. Jackson was for Pulp Fiction.  Now I don't like the word cool, but he was coool!    The main downfall is the guest speakers Jonathan Ross and Kate Thornton.  As the characters were created to resembles the voice boxes of their American counter parts.  However, the British version added home-grown voices, and as a result, it looks cack.  It pulls you out of the atmosphere.  For example, the fresh and cute voice of Kate Thornton replaces the exaspeated tones of Joan Rivers, so the product is a character that appears to be struggling to get her words out, but gives of an easy sound.  All in all, though, that is a very minor flaw.  I can't wait until shrek 3...  Until then, that's all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   Ever heard of Athleteâs Foot or Writerâs Cramp?  Well I think I have discovered two new conditions: kiterâs claw and cyclistâs arse.    The first occurs after holding onto the constantly tugging kite in cold weather.  The muscles in the fingers undergo constant tension, being pulled and pulled.  The moment the kiter lets go, their hands are left contorted in a way that it seems theyâve never let go.  The muscles refuse to flex back into shape and the kiterâs hand is left looking like the shaking fist of a grizzly bear (assuming a grizzly bear had hands and shook them in an angry fashion).    Cyclistâs Arse seems pretty self explanatory.  After long periods of cycling, particularly over bumpy ground, the bones surrounding the gluteus maximus get really quite bruised.  The moment the cyclist attempts to get back on the bike, it is fairly painful to sit down.    Okay, I may not have discovered these conditions, but Iâll be fecked if there is an official medical term called Cyclistâs Arse.  Therefore, I shall coin these terms and add them to âMr.T the Messiahâs Encyclopaedia of Knowledgeâ.    Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy everybody,   I have been informed that my blog entries are just too darned quirky.  Well, being a cult leader who cares what his followers want, here is a report on the German Neo-Realists of cinema, free of anecdote and void of all emotionâ¦  The first example of a German Neo-Realistâs inspiration could be argued to have appeared in the early 1950âs, when the great depression wasâ¦  Oh crud, screw it; it just canât be done.  There isnât a cure on Earth for my light-hearted quirkiness.  My quirky charm is one of the luxuries in life that a cult leader can have in life, along with changing the world and receiving mass praise.    Surely there is a use for quirkiness in this world.  Without it, there would be no observational humour or anecdote.  Being quirky isnât only the way you speak, it is a way of life; it is the way we look at things.  Imagine if we couldnât see an object from several angles, trying to pick out a funny aspect, the world would be filled with far dryer and infinitely less interesting people.    At this point, I should apologise to the person who disliked my quirkiness and ask that he doesnât hit me.  Sorry.    The truth is, quirkiness may well be an odd way of life, but itâs the only way I can do it, and you canât take that from me.  Mwa ha ha.  Any more of this anti-quirkiness propaganda and I will be forced to smite you.  SMITE YOU!  Until then, thatâs all folks!

      Howdy everybody!  Yay!  The summer has well and truly begun and what a great day to celebrate that fact.  In a moment of madness, I agreed to cycle to school this morning (just so you know, that's about 15-20 miles).  Despite the preconceptions I had about the early morning journey, I really enjoyed it.  Travelling through the quiet country lanes, we promptly woke it up by playing music over the speakers at full blast.  The sun was beaming down.  The fields of Scotland were shaping up to look like the vinyards of France.    When we arrived at school, we realised what little point there was of being there.  First period: Study (no homework to do in it), Second Period: Art (always a skive), Third and Fourth: the Assembly.  Well, we didn't bother going to the Assembly; its a waste of time and is only there to promote numb bums.  Having said that, I would have liked to have seen some friends of mine collecting their awards.  Congratulations Siouxsie on your Drama and RMPS Awards!  I'm sorry I didn't see your Mum and Granny...  As we left, the Headmaster was driving by.  Dagnabbit, he caught us!  We just said we had exiats and kept on cycling.  Only time will tell if he checked up on our story.  In the meantime, we went kiting down at the beach.  The wind was so gusty that it got a bit annoying.  I was sitting down as it unexpectedly took off; it dragged me on my front as I tried to restrain it.  This kind of thing doesn't hurt, but it does mean that your boxers effectively scoop up the sand.  Hmm, charming...  I'm going to make full use of the summer this year.  I've applied for a job at the school so that should keep my funds going if I get it.  If I don't, it'll mean constant begging to parents.  fingers crossed...  Until then, that's all folks!

      The holidays have finally drawn to an end and school begins tomorrow.  Sigh.  On one hand, Iâm glad to get back to school, as Iâll get to see all those groovy guys and gals again.  On the other hand, it is the end of what has been quite a jam-packed holiday, concluding with the only full week of sun weâve had.   After endlessly pushing back our camping plans purely to suit the more lazy-assed of the posse, Conor and I finally decided to politely âscrew themâ and go camping by ourselves.  Yes, just the two of us; no jokes please.   I was a bit uneasy with the idea of only two of us for this reason: Conor.  Despite his wild and donât-give-a-damn nature, he is actually a fairly quiet lad.  Not in the timid sense, but more the fact of being content with silence.  All of which is cool but in a sleep over-esque situation where groups tend to be preferred, some conversation is desired.   In the end, it turned out to be a really serene and tranquil night under the clearest sky in weeks.  We even saw shooting stars.  Lots of them.  And satellites.  Yes, satellites.  We even crossed the sandbanks to visit the seals, where I took amazing pictures with my ânewâ old camera I prematurely inherited from my Grandad.  Iâll post them up as soon as theyâre developedâ¦  Another gathering of a very different sort was one of my pal Danâs infamous shindigs.  This was to celebrate/ pity our exam results, via a Halo fest and as much alcohol as we could find in Danâs house.    NOTE TO READER: Any character assassination in the following passage is entirely unmeantâ¦well, maybe just a little.    We arrived at Danâs along with Daveyâs brother Jamie.  I was not the only one that was ever so slightly disgruntled by this because he is not a member of our posse, and his personality is completely out of phase from our own brands.  Dan didnât know he was coming either.   Not to let a little grudge bother us, we proceeded with the shindig and fooled about, had a laugh, and got very shallow indeed.  We played Halo for hours while listening to some wupp-ass Rock.  It was hilarious to see the Heitler team cowering from the speakers and moaning that it was too loud.  Youâre not listening to music until you can feel the music!   The night progressed and leaving the X-box behind (Iâm more of Nintendo guy myself) we moved through to the lounge, one of the many little comfort spots in the house.  Dan and I (the drinkers in the group) scavenged for any whisky or lager about the house but found only things such as gin, port, wine (which included ginger wine â  bleugh! ).  At first, I was disappointed because I fancied a dram, but the port and wine did the job.  We practically finished the lot between us.   The bulk of the conversation was probably an extension of the usual questions like:  âWhoâd you fancy?â   Or maybe even truth or dare (this time without the dare).  Jamie seemed very self-conscious of his answers, constantly uttering that nothing we say should ever leave the room.  Donât worry, weâd be to embarrassed to mention some of what  weâd even listened to.  If you want to know any of my answers Iâll need a fecking good pretty please.  With a gigantic cherry on top.   When I was talking about sleepovers to my female canoeing buddies, they seemed quite surprised that guys talked about sensitive stuff like that.  Well, to set the record straight, not all of us guys care about all that machismo stuff.  Oh no, we read magazine quizzes and do each others hair...  Climb high, climb safe!  p.s. remember to vote for my animation.  Just look for  urlLink The Baby and the Teddy Bear

      Heavens to Betsy, the exam results are finally in. Yay. Like several thousand others, I woke up early enough to realise that the postman doesn't arrive for another two hours. Instead, I watched GMTV.  Here is what I was expecting to get, as I sat absolutely zombiefied by the grannyvision:   urlLink          Art - A   I put so much work into this, and without bragging too much, I think I am pretty good.     German - A   I deserve a B, but I thought the exam went well.

      Howdy Everybody,  Tomorrow, two very important things will happen:    Thousands of kids my age across Britain will recieve their exam results    The online vote at channel 4 will begin.    Yep, not only will my questionable intelligence have been judged and sent to national statistics to prove how many people have failed English, but my creativeness will also be judged by the general public. Yes, that sound you hear really is the sound of my nails being bitten beyond existence.  Hold the phone though! I have just written an angry email to the folk working for Channel 4 because they have made a terrible mistake. Instead of using my final storyboard, they have re-used my original concept (you know, the one I have publicised to hell over the past few months). Everyone else has got theirs up and running in time, but those cretins have ignored me!  On the bright side, you can still vote for me  urlLink right here , just look for "A Baby and A Teddy Bear". You have to register so that you can only vote twice, but I'm sure no one would mind if all of you suddenly had a brief spell of multiple personality...   urlLink  CLICK HERE TO VOTE!!!    Ah yes, the blatant canvassing continues. I would feel guilty, but the others will be doing exactly the same. How about you tell everyone on you're email address list to vote for me. Just tell them to swing by here and click on one of the links like  urlLink this one , or maybe even  urlLink this one .  There is very good news. One of the twenty finalists missed the deadline, so my chances have increased to 1/19. Yay! Then if I don't get picked by the public, I still have a 1/6 chance. Even bigger yay!  Anyway, I'm going to bed so I can get up early to await the postman. Just one more thing... In case I forgot:    urlLink VOTE FOR ME RIGHT HERE!!!    Toodle Pip!

      Howdy everybody,  The time has nearly come for the web vote to determine whether my animation gets to be on television.  The votes start on the 10th of August at 9am - write this in your diary, or better yet, scrawl it on the foreheads of everyone close to you, so that everytime you look at them, you will think:    "Oh my goodness gracious me!  I must vote for that guy on the net!"     As soon as it goes online, I will give you so many links to the site that you'll just have to go.  Just remember to vote for Gordon Strachan (that's the one with the sinister teddy bear storyline).  If you want to see the original concept that got me shortlisted  urlLink click here .   It's taken long enough for them to get it online, but on the 10th of August (which is incidently the date I get my exam results), my future may well be in your hands!  Choose well, choose Gordon Strachan!!    p.s. I'm still waiting for ideas for signing off each post...

      Howdy everybody,  You may remember a month or so back, I had a nasty kite boarding accident, and got a hefty gash on my forehead.  Well, the cut cleared up good enough leaving a mark in its place.  I figured this was just the remnant of the healing process but a month later, it is still there.  I have a scar.  Just like Harry Potter.   Dude.   After close examination, I realised that it was in fact glowing.  Balls of energy started emanating from my finger tips and before I knew it, I was fighting the forces of evil.  Then a letter came through the post, delivered by a sparrow.  I thought this strange that it wasnât an owl.  Cinema had tricked me.  It was an invitation to the local Wizards school.  However, I turned it down in order to carry out my life long dream of becoming a World Dictator.  Then I changed my mind; I wanted to be like Hulk Hogan.   Alright, I made that last paragraph up.  Except for the Hulk Hogan thing.  Heâs cool; he was in Mr. Nanny.    ---(Still waiting for more ideas for a goodbye note)---
