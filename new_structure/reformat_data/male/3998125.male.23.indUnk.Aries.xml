       Today was a good day for me.  A little bumpy in the morning as I missed my appointment with Christian.  I thought about all the excuses I could give, but when it came down to it, I didn't want to lie to him out of respect and also because Christian is my friend.  Actually, I think it was more of what he said to me once on the topic of excuses.      "If we can make excuses for ourselves to justify the things we do, then there really is no purpose for God's forgiveness."      Christian is an awesome guy and I regard him as more than just a college youth pastor.  I have to, because why else would his words stick to me like that?  Anyhow, I did talk with Christian to apologize.  He took the time to meet with me in spite of his busy schedule and I didn't even show up.  Christian forgave me.      The morning to a bit of a dive when Brooke called to say Brian decided not ot cover for me.  I was pretty disappointed that I wasn't going to get the time off, but I also wasn't all that surprised.  Brooke picked up on it and called Brian.  Brian reluctantly agreed to keep his promise.  I received another call from Brooke to tell me I still had the first half of my shift off.  I almost blew it because I was thinking it would be worth my misery to work those extra four hours if I could spoil whatever fun Brian was planning to have with a guilt trip.  Of course, I came to my senses realizing that Brian would not honestly care if I was miserable at work while he got to go out and play.  I went against my nature and did something nice for myself for a change.      To my surprise, I enjoyed myself.  I enjoyed my day.  I felt some guilt, knowing my free time came at the expense of someone who didn't really want to be covering for me.  I could give reasons to nullify feeling guilty or justify the day I enjoyed.  But I've already given my piece on justification and excuses.      I guess it's like sorta like what God did for us.  Jesus didn't want to die for us, but he did it anyway because he loved us that much... (although it was quite different in my other example)... but he did it anyway because he loved us that much.  And while some of us can go on the rest of our lives feeling guilty about things or even take his grace for granted- well... I think it's healthy to realize that we are not where we should be because of grace.      Realizing this much, I think I'm apt not to reject a moment of grace to wallow in misery and self-pity.

      Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, To change the things I cannot accept, And the wisdom to hide the bodies of those people I had to kill today because they pissed me off. And also, to be careful of those toes I step on today As they may be connected to the ass I may have to kiss tomorrow, Help me to always give 100% at work/school; 12% on Monday, 23% on Tuesday, 40% on Wednesday, 20% on Thursday, and 5% on Friday. And help me to rememberâ¦ When Iâm having a bad day, And it seems that people are trying to piss me off, That it takes 42 muscles to frown and only 4 to extend my middle finger And tell them to bite me.

      I called Jason yesterday morning to talk to him about the philosophical question: "Does the end justify the means?" Unfortunately, when he called me back, I was still working on footage for Heatwave so he had to leave a message. I got done with shooting and headed out to the church for college group and after that I went over to the Mesa to drop off a movie for Sammy.   It was nice the way things had worked out, actually. Jason and Jon were the only ones home so I ended up talking to them about a "hypothical" relational situation between Guy A and Guy B under the pretense of utilitarianism, which as I lovingly refer to as "That Spock Thing." After a good Q session with Jason about morality, Jon jumped in with his two cents about it and said what I didn't know I was looking for until I heard it.   The short version: Guy A does something good for Guy B. A knows B will have to pay a high price. B has no idea that it will cost him. A doesn't tell B what the cost is. Adoes what's bestfor B at B's expense. B finds out that A knew the whole time what it would cost and didn't bother to tell B knowing B would not accept the price if B knew what the price was. B is indignant and thinks A is a complete A-hole.   Basically, it was the first time I gotsome kind of affirmation from anyone that I had a right to be resentful towards Adam. Now I'm at a crossroads, I know why I feel the way I do. I know that I have a right to feel the way I do. "So what do I do about it?" remains the question.   I thought that I knew the Mesa guys well enough to know that if one person has a conflict with someone outside the Mesa house, they all support each other. I admire that support and I want to be a part of it. So the biggest fear of mine, and still is, is that if my resentment towards Adam were out in the open our mutual friends would be forced to choose between us. I honestly don't think I could ever be good enough, important enough, or valued enough as a person to be able to compete with Adam. I fear that I would lose the closest family I have, and sometimes- the only family I've ever known.   I want to hate Adam so much, but literally for Christ's sake, I know I have to forgive him because this whole thing is doing more damage than just to how I feel. I talked to Tessa about the whole thing because she didn't know any of these people. And she was so supportive of me and she was angry with Adam because of the hurt he caused me. It wasn't until she said, "How can someone like that call himself a Christian? This is why I'm glad I'm not a Christian because of hypocrites like him..."   It wasn't about me anymore. It was about God. In my insecurity and weakness, I unknowingly gave witness to hurt the cause of Christ. In my vehement suffering, I testified that Christians do not act the way they imply that they do. We as Christians are weak and miserable representations of Christ. We hurt each other, we have falts, we let each other down, and we do not always support each other.   Tessa, a non-believer, was more loving, supportive, and caring than my own brother in Christ.I failed to provide a reason for her to believe in what I believe, while she gave me another reason why I shouldn't or needn't believein Godto find what I am searching for- to be loved.   How much more reason do I have now to forgive Adam for what he did to me?

       Over the last three days I've been allowing myself to get swept up and away with the video project for Heatwave.        On Tuesday I spent 5 hours shooting, 2.5 hours capturing, another 6 hours editing. The results: roughly 13 of 15 minutes edited and ready for DVD transfer for the 10 Commandments of Heatwave movie. This means I have two scenes to shoot and edit down to 2 minutes a piece in order to have an appropriately fitting video-short for the opening night of Heatwave on Sunday Night.    Wednesday was originally planned to finish the last two scenes, but plans fell apart as everyone felt rather unmotivated. I spent most of the day working on categorizing scenes, editing shots, and prepping the files I captured to be put together as a DVD, rather than just a bunch of video shorts or music/video montages.   Thursday, (today), was spent in an attempt to fill in the holes. Self-appointed"Director" David, and self-appointed "Editor in chief" (myself) had creative differences over how long the video-short should be and what should be displayed in it. I now understand first-hand how insane the conflicts must be at Hollywood when a director believes forthright that his work is one of a kind,every single shot is golden, and that editing of any kind should be limited to cut and paste only at the director's discretion. However, I believe that a 10-15 minute video should be limited to 10-15 minutes rather than 25-30 minutes. Especially when the video is designed to replace a youth pastor's "Things-You-Can-And-Cannot-Do-While-You-Are-Here-At-Church-Water-Ski-Camp" lecture. Even more especially when the video's target audience is a group of 80 Junior High and High School students- all of whom will have spent an entire day working and sweating to set up both a soundstage and their own camps and probably will not get to shower that first day.   I will certainly give David his due credit. I think he's a briliant guy, verytalented in his creative works, and he clearly has a vision. He's a very good director.   I would like to think that I'm thehalf that keeps this project grounded. Cheesiness in a camp video is good. Changing the level of cheesiness from moderate to extreme when the video is about 99% complete isn't a good idea. It ruins the consistancy and flow. It may attract some attention and get some laughs, but I don't think it would make for a good video. Secondly, a 30-minute video telling you what you can and can't do, (as clever as it may be produced), is not a good idea when your audience is likely to be a massive horde of attention-deficit teenagers. I'm theguy who willdo the dirty work of making sure the end result stays on focus. This means cutting out scenes that may be excessive or unnecessary and out of touch with the video's goal. Don't get me wrong or anything, but I think a lot of the stuff I cut out is genius, but there's nothing wrong with saving somethingto whetthe desire for the Heatwave DVD- i.e. Special Features.   Anyhow, we've hit a few rough spots for the video because of our creative differences.I'll work with the footage I have even if I disagree with the style. Regardless of our opinions, I'm sure it will be a success, God willing, of course.

       It was about 2:16 am when I went on UCSB's academic GOLD system (Gaucho Online something or another...) when I received a confirmation that my B.A. in Linguistics was awarded.        So how smart do you have to be to go to a school where the bureaucratic red tape causes you to spend 5 years in a 4 year educational institution, and upon graduation receive two letters on the same day from said bureaucratic offices- one stating "Congratulations, you be a educated guy now" and the other letter says "We'z all dunnathink ya gots 'da rights to be goin' so soon since we be bootin' you right outta coh-lej before you'z can gets yo' day-gree."    Think about it: 5 years of work to complete a 4 year degree that costs $80,000 (or $16,000 per year) to purchase a piece of paper that says "I be educated" with $20,000 in loans that with accrued interest will take me the next portion of my life to pay off before I can actually START earning money because that $80,000 piece of paper says I am now qualified for a decent job. Amazing ain't it?   Oh, wait. My buddy Hugo, (And fellow '99 UCSB STEPper), has just corrected me. It's not just an $80,000 piece of paper, it's an $80,000 ACCREDITED piece of paper that says I am now qualified for a decent job.   I guess that an $80,000 piece of paper just can't compare to an $80,000 ACCREDITED piece of paper, now can it?   Thank God, I have something to show for it.   Now... about that A.A. in Accounting at CC that I'm considering...

       I began my day waking up at 7:15 am. I went back to sleep to finish whatever dream I was having but last night's revelation of how much more I valued a tangible friendship over God rang throughout most of my morning. I don't remember exactly what the dream was, but this theme of having to choose friendship over God permeated into my R.E.M phase of sleep. I think I remember half the time I chose God and the other half I chose my friends.    10:30 am rolls around and it's time for me to head off to Sunday service. I park my car in the far end of the lot and as I walk towards the worship center, two guys caught my attention as they were discussing the final vote on the new head pastor. "Christian's on the fence... blah blah blah." Christian is in charge of the college ministries and he does a damn good job of it. The kind of tone they seemed to have when they were talking about Christian's indecision was bugging me a lot. So much to the point I considered telling them to back off of Christian and to give him some breathing room. I wanted to tell them to sod off. Granted it's an important decision, but I can tell he's under a lot of stress.Half the people want Christian to accept this candidate and half the people him tochoose someone else. Iwanted to tell those twomiddle-aged fartsthat Christian's going to do what he believes God is going to lead him to do. It's not a life and death situation as some people make it out to be, (not trying to make this decision sound less important), but it's certainly not a decision Christian is going to make without God. I trust God to make the right decision and I trust Christian's ability to follow God.   Worshipwas goingon and the whole "Godor friends first" pops back into my head. Sitting in the back of the congregation for so long, I've developed aknack for identifying the back of people's heads. "Yes, no, no, maybe, probably not, definately not, for sure, possibly..." It was rapid-fire sacrilege. The offering plate passed... "no, maybe, possibly..." I wastrying to be completely honest with myself. Of all the friends I've made at CCC, who have I put first in my life before God? Who would I put before God. Why, knowing outright what I know, would I even put anybody or anything before God? I got up and left before worship finished.   I sat outside the church on a bench near one of the entrances to ponder and pray over my heresy. "God forgive me. I don't know why I feel the way I do. But please help me to place you first in my life, even if it means..." I paused to seriously consider what I was about to say, "...even if it means having to sacrifice my friends who I love." It was silent.   Out of desperation, fear, or whatever else, I quickly followed up with, "But please if at all possible, please help me to put you first without having to sacrafice my friendships."   Which was followed by, (now that I think of it), a rather irreverant and pathetic, "God, if you would also please just send one of my friends along to keep me company so I can talk about what's on my mind?"   A moment passed and there was no one. Another moment passed and there was no one. "Please God?" A third moment passed and Brian just "happened" to come along while the sermon was still going.   Brian and I chatted about his busy weekend, work, weddings and his new Rav 4. I sat there, nodding and giving my "uh-huh's," all the while I'm thinking in the back of my mind, "Holy freak! How in the world did this happen?" I was fighting to get the words out to say what I wanted to say about what was on my mind but I was too far beyond astounded to get anything out. A voice whispered, "Get it out now or don't say I don't answer prayers." It was like everything hit me at once I and was deaf and dumb and blind and born to follow Jesus.   "...so anyways," says Brian "I should get back inside."   Brian got up and went back inside.   I was awestruck.   God is *so* good.

       I got off work and figured I'd try IM'ing Chris. He asked me if I was okay. I said no. He wasn't doing well either. He couldn't talk so I told him that if we both ever had issues going on at the same time, I would put mine aside to help him with his.   So a moment later I was in bed, comfortably set for the night. I prayed for my forgiveness because of the issues I can't seem to let go of. But Chris' well-being was more pressing. So I prayed for Chris, that whatever was hurting him would be taken away so he could be happy again. The next few words in my prayer for Chris astounded me to a point of disbelieving shock.  "If it's not too much to ask, please let Chris know I love him and I'll be there for him if he ever needs anything. He's my friend and I would give anything I have to know my friends are happy..." Anyhow, the disbelieving shock hit when I thought about how "anything"could even include my faith in God.  Was God trying to tell me something here? The cause of my angst with my friends was based off the fact that I put my friends before God. The real mind blower was that I always thought my relationships with my friends were a reflection of my relationship with God.Friends in my experience have always been few and *very* far between. True friends are a scarcity I would gladly trade anything for- my blood, my life, and evenmy soul.  I guess the thing is that my relationship with the people from Community Covenant Church isreally unique. The friends I've made from CCCare sort of like- I guesstangible figures of God. It's that aspect of tangibility with God that makes it so much easier to believe in Him. For a guy who has a hard time with faith, to have a friend who is a direct representation of all the hopes and dreams of the relationship you wish to find in God... it's... it's...  ...much easier to put your faith in when you have so little faith as I do. I'm talking about a friend you can see, feel, and hear. I'm talking about friendswho canrespond instantaneously and you can physically interact with. But on the flip side, I'm also talking about a friend who is human, has flaws, and can sometimes seriously let you down.  That's where the real self-evaluation comes in and you just have to ask yourself, "Do I really have so little faith, that I can only afford to invest in imperfectfriends however tangible, and not in the intangible infinite goodness of God?"  When it all came down to the last words of my prayer for Chris, I most thankfully was able to realize that I really can't afford *not* to invest my faith in God. God is the one true friend I must be gladly willing to trade anything for- my blood, my life, and my soul. If nothing else, simply because he did the same for me.   Anyhow, it's now 1:30 am, and I am completely energized by the insight God gave me. It's sort of like a jolt of lightning running through every vein in my body. I'm hungry and I'm thinking of getting an early breakfast but I'm to buzzed on God (or too lazy...) to get up and get something. But after this carthartic proliferation of words, I'm sure I should be able to sleep well. Goodnight all!

       Sammy,    I was going to try to talk to Christian about this like you suggested over the phone the other day. But I'm think he's got enough stuff to worry about then to bug him with my issues. I know you're pretty busy too... (so I figure I'll just write a letter I know I'll probably never send out).    It's been almost one week since my last cigarette and boy, do I feel like shit. Since then, I've managed to get next to nothing done. I sleep whenever I can and when I can't sleep I vegetate. I've pondered just dropping everything, packing up all my stuff and just moving to the middle of nowhere just to start over. Oh, and I'm pretty sure I've managed to slaughter whatever relationship I had left with Adam over the last few days.     I was trying to take all of this in when the question popped up: "If I were the only Christian in the world, would I still believe?" Initially- yes. Honestly- not likely. I'm seriously reconsidering what my faith is really based on. "Abide in me and I will abide in you..." If my faith isn't really based on Christ, that would explain a lot about how my walk with God is doing, wouldn't it?      Bernard

      I called Adam this morning to see if he got the email and to apologize for my anger with him. He got it and apologized as well.  Then there was that moment of awkward silence and it was all quiet on the western front.  "I guess I'll see you around," I said. "Yeah, you too," he replied.  What friendship seen it never was, What angerhad is no more, Whatwill beI do not know, What is to come I cannot see, Words wielded, spirits broken, wills were lost. I am- He is- sameness... likeness... ...We are no more.

      So it seems whatever friendship was left between me and Adam may just as well have flatlined as I have yet to hear back from him. I think the worst, in that what I've emailed him will be turned against me because there are mutual friends who are more than likely going to be sucked into this. If that's the case, most of my relationships will probably flatline as well because there's no way I would ever be able to compete against someone as popular as Adam. "Walk towards the light," cries out the relationship angels...  Funny thing about "walking in the light." Biblical principles (from my understanding) say to try to work it out with the person you have a conflict with. And if you can't work it out, bring in the church, and then if it still can't be worked out, you are asked to leave. Any relationship that ends like this makes me feel as if I've already got one foot in the grave.  However, following a moment of prayer, something commanded my attention and I understood. Why in the world I felt so hurt shouldn't even be an issue. Here I am, whining about a failed friendship when it dawns on me how frequently I have failed God whether if it was in action or something else. Yet I am still forgiven and I am still loved. God is good no matter how crappy things get and that's what I need to learn. Just as God's given me his grace, I need to extend that to everybody else, even if I do get burned in the process.  I certainly won't apologize for what I feel, but I will apologize for the hatred I let fester inside of me. No one deserves that.  "I walk in darkness still, but I am walking towards the light- that I may be in the light, as you are in the light."

       I had a nightmare last night. It wasn't anything frightening like a psycho killer chasing you through the house, trying to catch you. In fact, the portion that bothered me the most was when I dreamed I saw my beloved suede jacket thrown on the floor. It may have been trampled on, I don't remember. I was upset and asked who did it. Someone pointed in the opposition direction.      I walked on and found Adam lying on the ground comfortably, trying to get some sleep because he was sick. I didn't care and confronted him about it. I don't remember exactly all the details, but it involved us yelling at each other. I woke up, sick to my stomach.    ---      Adam,      This is eating me up inside. I wanted to talk to you before it got to this point because I didn't want to hurt you, but I need to be truthful with you.      You hurt me more than you could ever realize. You opened up old wounds in me that hurt so bad I have nightmares because of it. You cannot imagine how it feels to be treated the way you have treated me.      I once knew someone like you. I considered him a friend, like I did you. But I was nothing more than a missions project to him. What your real purpose was in introducing me to Community Covenant, I will never know. The difference between the two of you was that he had to convince me he was my friend. I trusted you.      I harbor a lot of anger and resentment towards you. I first went to Juice because you invited me. That night, you barely spoke two words to me- "Hey Bernard." I was left alone the whole night with your friends- on the sidelines to listen to stories of people I never knew; an outsider listening to inside jokes about your study on Malachi. I was hurt but I trusted you enough to chalk it up to dumb-luck. About a month later you hurt me even more when you and Sammy ganged upon me, telling me that "I didn't need to buy your friendship because I already had it." Well, Adam, all I can say is that if knew I had to buy your friendship, I never would have wanted it.      Do you remember saying, "Bernard, please don't give up on me?"      Like I said over the phone, I don't think you have any right to joke around with me if you've never taken the time (or made the simplest effort) to hang out with me. If you did, maybe you might have realized there was a lot more to me. The way it stands now is that around you, I feel extremely self-conscious and less than human. I'm still around because I found God's grace. In short... mission accomplished.      Bernard

       Heatwave is starting in a few weeks. I expect it will be an interesting experience. Heatwave is a summer water ski camp for junior high and high school kids at Community Covenant Church; my churchhere in Santa Barbara.   I am now a college grad, (I think...) and have been able to take on this cool new role at CCC as a leader. The funny thing is that I can't see myself as a leader. I remember the Sunday that there was a church announcement for help with the high school group. I wanted to help, so I spoke with Kai (then in charge of high school ministries). I expected to help- as in office help or organizational stuff. When he mentioned leadership, I personally thought he was off his rocker. How could I of all people be a leader when I was struggling with issues in my own life and my own faith?  It's been about two and a half months since I conceived the notion of helping out.Seven high school group sessions, four leader observations, one "Obey Your Thirst," one leader's meeting, one Sunday hosting, and one home visit later- I'm beginning to find my niche in how I might be able to help out. Highlight the word "beginning."  I don't know how I can be a leader, or who I would lead. I just know that I've made a commitment here. And in my heart, I need to do everything I can to keep that commitment. It's hard though. I'm done with school and there's forces at work in my life. I should say voices, rather than forces. Voices that beckon me to take advantage of some of these job opportunities that have come my way. Job opportunities that offer me better wages and benefits than what I'm making now. But I realize that as lucritive as it may be, I need to stay here because I've made a commitment to God.  You'd think that a God fearing person would have no concerns if he was doing what God was calling him to do. In all honesty though, my faith in God is nowhere near where I'd like it to be. My faith in what is to be feels as shaky as a house of cards.It has come to my attention that my walk with God has become a mathematical loop somehow-I believe in spite of uncertainty because of my faith, and I have faith in spite of doubt because I believe.   I guess in the end, all I might really have is just hopeful wishing. Here's to hopeful wishing...

      Iâm having a great day. I got the âHeatwave Glimpseâ footage done and it went well in the early and later service. The high school leaders meeting also went well as we discussed the future of cell groups and incoming freshman. Highlight of my day: Lunch after church.  Twelve of us from college ministries went to Chiliâs for lunch. A huge fire was taking place on the San Marcos pass so while we were concerned, it was still pretty cool to see the gigantic cloud of black smoke right next to the gigantic cloud of white smoke rising up to the sky on an otherwise perfectly clear day. I might also add that we could see the rise of smoke all the way from Chiliâs on Glen Annie if that gives any of you readers an idea of how big it was.  I got to sit next to Brittany at Chiliâs. Brittany didnât seem know anyone else because she is new to college group, so I lucked out because I got to chat with her over lunch about stuff we experienced at Heatwave. I am quite fond of Brittany, actually. Sheâs intelligent, articulate, and awesome to hang out with.  Anyhow, our conversation led up to two really cool students weâre going to really miss since we got a chance to know them better over Heatwave. We compared some notes and came to the conclusion that Bobert and Corey (brothers) are each a total blessing from God. The more Brittany and I talked about them the more we agreed how sad it was we didnât get a chance to know them sooner before the moved to Indiana. Bobert might come off shy, but if you can get a one-on-one conversation going with him, heâs actually got a lot of insightful things to say. And itâs not a like what he has to say is asinine either. Corey is pretty entertaining because heâs got this extroverted demeanor combined with this willingness (of sorts) to please, mixed in with a really funny sense of humor. (I got that impression when he told me my AIM screenname was too boring and I should try something like âbigmacdaddypimpâ). Of course, what impressed both of us the most was how their family always seems to try to serve God or obey His will. I think itâs pretty rare that a family would discuss, pray and make a decision to move across the country togetherâ¦ as a family. Pretty much everyone Iâve ever known whoâs moved away simply moved because the parents made a decision and that was final. In spite of leaving everything behind, Bobert and Corey felt God was calling them to Indiana and obeyed. Itâs a bittersweet story, but I give props to both of them for being living sacrifices for their parents.  Anyways, I spent about three full days hanging out with Bobert and only about two weeks really actually getting to know him as more than just a guy who went to high school group. Like I said, Iâm definitely bummed heâs moving away. But as Iâve always believed, âreal friends are far and few between,â so I fully intend on keeping in touch.

      It has now been officially one month since my last cigarette.  The âHeatwave Glimpseâ I did for todayâs Sunday Service got completed and went over well at both services.â  I am roughly at about 70% done with reviewing and cataloging all the footage I took at Heatwave which means the capturing/editing portion will go much smoother.  Overall, progress towards completion is further than expected.  Iâve picked up a second job at Ward Construction.  Things are going well and Iâm hoping that this will become a full time job (that I enjoyâ¦) in which I work mornings and get evenings and weekends off.  That would be beautiful.

       "Therefore, brothers, I urge you in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God- this is your spiritual act of worship.  Do not conform any longer to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is- his good, pleasing and perfect will." (Rom 12:1-2)   This was the scripture we focused on over the last week at Heatwave.  What have I learned or realized?  Simply this: a sacrifice is something you desire to keep but give up for the benefit of something or someone else.  A living sacrifice (in this context) is a life you choose in which you give up something you don't want to let go of for the sake of pleasing God.  I.e. friends, habits, persuing desires or dreams, etc.  In short, putting God first in your life.  How can I apply this in my own life?  I need to put less focus on how my friendships with other Christians are doing and more focus on what keeps our friendship together- God.  I need to trust and believe that God is more than enough to handle anything that comes up in my life rather than try to carry the whole burden myself.  Most importantly, I need to extend the same mercy that was given to me...  Some say, "Time heals all wounds."  I say, "Love heals all wounds.  God is love."
