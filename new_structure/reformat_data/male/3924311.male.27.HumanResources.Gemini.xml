      Yea, silence is the key. I try only to speak about job stuff. The rest of the time, may the silence rule the place. Why? Because IÂ´m trying to forget her and the first step to forget a girl u have to see everyday is ignoring her. So I hardly say a word.

      First off, let me say that English is not my native tongue but I want this to be understood for as much people as possible. So, why "Old words for a new blog"? Well, the "new blog" part is easy: this is the first time that I do something like this. And the "old words"? ThatÂ´s the reason IÂ´m putting these words here.  Right now IÂ´m in the office. My hands, my fingers, my knees are shaking; IÂ´m lucky of being sit down. I also have a little headache and my stomach hurts bad. Do I have the flu? Nope, but itÂ´s because of something as old as the flu: IÂ´m in love.   I admit it, IÂ´m in love with one of my office mates; in fact, sheÂ´s my only mate because thereÂ´s only the two of us here at the offcice. WeÂ´re completly alone.   I donÂ´t wanna tell all the story now from the beginning, IÂ´ll do it on another time. Today, I just need to say that sheÂ´s not in love with me. She hasnÂ´t told it that way, but I know it and the knowing of it itÂ´s whatÂ´s killing me deep inside, making me feel really really bad. I donÂ´t know words in English to express the pain IÂ´m going thru but IÂ´m sure many of you know what IÂ´m talking about. So you can imagine my situation. SheÂ´s only a few steps away from me but that distance is an abyss I cannot jump. So close and so far. I wanna reach out and touch her, feel her skin (the smoothest skin ever) but I canÂ´t. And IÂ´m dying. ThatÂ´s pretty close to what IÂ´m feeling now; I feel like IÂ´m dying.   Why she didnÂ´t tell me that she didnÂ´t feel anything about me?  Why did she let me believe that I had any opportunity with her?
