      Wow. "Passion" was incredible. You all need to see it, even if you aren't a Christian. The only problem is, it made me think. I've realized that nothing I do will ever come remotely close to what Jesu and teh Disciples did. All I really want is to be remembered. But I feel like there's nothing I  can   do to be remembered. I want to go down in history s someone who fought for his beliefs. I want to become a martyr or a saint or a war hero, bt none of those are very likely. I want to do something for God, but I don't think I can be a minister, I don't feel like "tending the flock" is for me. I feel so, so, helpless. I wish I could've been in that movie, I would give anything to be in a movie that powerful. Maybe I could write a book, or write articles for magazines about my faith, and what it means to be a modern Christian. Crap, I'm spiritually at a crossroad and nieither path is clear. Lord give me guidance. Well, that's all I got, peace. </post></Blog>
