       â¦While the moonlight shine in your face      Your eyes can reflect your soul.      In that deep brown of your eyes      I can see for a second your mind,      Your thoughts, you feelingsâ¦      I can see your happiness and your sadness,      I can see the most frightening evil nightmares,      And those beautiful pink dreamsâ¦      I can see all the beauty of the world and      I feel smallâ¦      I can see all this just for a second, and thenâ¦      You blink, as you close your eyes you close your mindâ¦

          A adolescÃªncia Ã© aquele periodo na vida de alguem, durante o qual este se recusa a acreditar que um dia serÃ¡ tao estupido ou mais que os seus prÃ³prios pais.

         Iâm lying down in my bed,Over me a strange light,It seems to shine in light blue deep pinkâ¦It looks so fragile, looks like my mindâ¦I wake up, I was dreaming. Then I remember you, I remember about the times that we were at schoolYou used to seat next to meâ¦ Iâve been remembering those times a lot lately,Now we are long away one from another, I feel melancholic,I miss those timesâ¦The only way to reach you and those memories is just by feeling melancholicâ¦ We are grown up now Things are different, everything is much more serious nowâ¦I donât know if can stand it.Today itâs a dark evil deep night, Iâm felling weightless, that light is coming againâ¦ Iâm going away. Iâm dieing in my own existence, or â¦maybe notâ¦

         Now Iâm sited in my chair at school,I just think about you,The teacher is a fool,I just want to be near you,I canât stand this much longerâ¦ Iâm getting anger, I MISS YOUI say fuck off to the fool and I get off the school. Now Iâm sited near youI feel like if the world was mine,And youâ¦â¦Youâ¦ you just shine,Iâm yours and youâre mine,Things are in the right way,We kiss and go away.

         ...Se pensasse no que faÃ§o, nada fazia,FaÃ§o o que nÃ£o penso,NÃ£o penso no que faÃ§o,NÃ£o digo o que faÃ§o,NÃ£o faÃ§o o que digo......Se pensasse no que digo, nada dizia,Digo o que penso,NÃ£o penso no que digo,NÃ£o digo o que faÃ§o...

                                                        Today it's a strange night,           Full is the moon, blued is the moonlight, shining are the stars dark is the sky, seeking is my mind, Seeking for youâ¦                                               â¦Were have you been?...           In these nights, only in these nights, I can get that feeling; feel you as if you were hereâ¦                         Feeling the heat that your body drains, feeling the sweet voice that your mouth speaks, feeling your heart beating as if it was mineâ¦ I almost can see you, but it was only a shadow, just another shadow, and you are not here with meâ¦

         Evil deep dark nights Itâs their time,  The Thoughtsâ¦  They need to get out of your mind, Your mind itâs their nestâ¦ Were they born, Were they get shape Were they grow  The Thoughtsâ¦  Your mind drains power to then, Your mind feeds them, Your eyes reflect their will Your brain is controlled by them  The Thoughtsâ¦  They are nothing without you But Youâre nothing without them  The Thoughts!...

          Someday you will wake up And you wonât see your shadow, Someday you will wake up And you wonât feel your body Someday you will wake up And you will know the meaning of FLY Someday you will wake up And you will see everybody you left behind  Then you will look to you life and youâll see that you had been a puppet in the others handsâ¦ Then you will look behind and youâll see that you had a miserable lifeâ¦ And then as you realize that you had been smashed like a bug you will bleed for revengeâ¦ You will want to cut the strings that had controlled you for a whole lifetime. You will want to break freeâ¦  So donât let the others control you! Be your self no matter what they may think, no matter what they may say, no matter what they may do!   Be your self everyday, Enjoying your life: As you want, As you plan, As you doâ¦

           Someday you will wake up, and you wont see your shadow Someday you will wake up, and you wont feel your body Someday you will wake up, and you will know the meaning of FLY Someday you will wake up, and you will see everybody you left behind   --Â»Devido a este Post ter sido colocado provisoriamente(Nao me lembrava deste pensamento na sua totalidade) apaguei a segunda parte do mesmo.
