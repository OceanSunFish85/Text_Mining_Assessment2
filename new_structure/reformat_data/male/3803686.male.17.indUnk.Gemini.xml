       Saturdays ! Donât you just love  Saturdays ? I love  Saturdays .  Saturdays  are fun. Today is no exception. Went out for a movie with my friends today even though I woke up this morning with an itchy throat and blocked nose. Went out to watch  SPIDERMAN ! Luckily Jeffri has a friend thatâs working in the cinema or else we wouldnât have gotten good seats. I meanâ¦the highest row, and we got the tickets without queuing up like other peopleâ¦mWAhAhahaAHaâ¦ Canât help but laugh at those buggers queuing up. The best part is when they actually reached the counter and the tickets are all sold out! LoLâ¦funny eh? I actually heard one woman saying, âAlamak, movie tu dah habis ticket larâ.  Anyway,  Spiderman  was sexay.  Dr. Octopus ? Even sexier! Spiderman was just waiting to have his groin crushed by him. Such sexy toy he hasâ¦4 metal indestructible tentacles waiting to smack the bejesus out of anyone that pisses him off. How sexy is thatâ¦those fuKking long tentacles can even stand a small supernova. If only I have thatâ¦then Iâll crush all my enemies with itâ¦ MwaHAhahaâ¦Iâll even name myselfâ¦Dr. Chee Liang! Waitâ¦that name is not cool enough. Think Chee Liangâ¦think! Ahâ¦I know, how about  Dr. Smasher ! Cool eh? No? Arghâ¦nvm. Hereâs how Iâll look.   urlLink    Dr. Smasher...  Ohâ¦Jeffri was being such an asshole in the cinema. Lolâ¦no offence Jeff, but you really were! He was like giving us lots ofâ¦erm, fugly â thoughts â. Dudeâ¦weâre in a cinema so behave man! Got to give him credit anyway cause heâs the one that got us the tickets!  THANKS  dudeâ¦youâre certified sexay! Wellâ¦gotta go eat dinner. Will blog again whenever I feel like it.

      I feel so tiredâ¦even coffee is not helpingâ¦might need another one later. I just finished fixing my templates. Took me quite awhile to figure out the links and stuffs. Anyway, the guys and I spent the whole afternoon watching people sing. Out of the 30-40 contestants there's only a few that can actually sing. I was trying so hard not to laughâ¦oh wait, not only me but others as well.   urlLink    Trying so hard not to laugh...  And did I mention how sucky the sound system wasâ¦? WTFâ¦I mean even my headphone sounds better than that. It was pitiful watching the contestants singing the same tune all over again because of some fukKed up system.   urlLink    Even my headphone sound better...  My good friend, Roger was singing a  duet  with his  beloved Swee Ling  and boy was it fun. It was our plan in trying to get them closer together and as usual our plan failed. We were hoping that he will do something  special  like hold her hands and stuff but all he did was just stand there and sing monotonously. WTF manâ¦where did all the courage go? Down the drain? Youâve just wasted a chance to âmengeratkan lagi your hubungan with herâ. They were quite okay thoughâ¦I mean their singing. However Roger needs more practicing cause he sounded more like talking instead of singing. Chong Wee and Elaine on the other hand was superb. They actually gave me goosebumps. Too bad they were joining this instead of Malaysian Idolâ¦ Anyway, time for some COFFEE!

      woHoo...! Oh..looky, I'm blogging! Everyone is blogging, I can't be left behind can I? I mean look at Rogerâ¦and Edwinâ¦and of course Hyon-Xhi, they are all blogging. So FUK itâ¦I'm gonna start blogging too. MwhaAhahaHâ¦  There are a few things on my mind right now. One of them is how many more days it is before SPM arrives. I recently asked my friend from Kedah a few days ago and guess what, SPM is on the 6th of Novemberâ¦that is if she's giving me the right information. However, we can be sure that it'll either be end of October or early of November. FuK! That leaves us form 5s likeâ¦around 4 months to studyâ¦4 fukKing months to coverâ¦hmm, lets seeâ¦say 10 subjects each with and average of at least 250 pages a subjectâ¦times that with 2 for form 4 and 5â¦that would be like 5000 pagesâ¦ Now take 5000 pages and divide it by 120, it means that I would have to study at least 42 pages a dayâ¦ You might be thinking hmmâ¦42 pages a day is actually nothing much to brag aboutâ¦it'll probably take like 2-3 hours to finish. It's so so not trueâ¦cause even if you do succeed in studying 42 pages a dayâ¦you might forget what you studied in like a week or so. Ain't life in Form 5 beautifulâ¦? Damn, I'm beginning to regret spending too much time playing around. I should start studying nowâ¦but I can't seem to find the will toâ¦ I seriously need some biTch slapping to wake me up!!! Somebodyâ¦or just anybodyâ¦biTch slap me will youâ¦bring back some sense into meâ¦ Oh wait, nvmâ¦put that on hold, cause for nowâ¦caffeine will do! Caffeineâ¦to me is actually one of the best things in lifeâ¦! It actually helps me to study...for now. Screw you if you think otherwiseâ¦or better, BITE ME.

      Itâs my favorite day of the week againâ¦ Woke up early today just to follow my dad out to eat bak-kut-the at Pandamaran. Went to school after that to watch the guys play some basketball. It was quite fun watching people getting kukufiedâ¦ There was this team that that got kukufied so badly that they didnât even managed to get a point in the first half. Shaun,  urlLink  Roger   and Wei Wei were like on fire! Especially Wei Weiâ¦its like as though he bela the ball or something.  urlLink  Edwin Ng   on the other hand was not in his usual form.   He was so uptight during the gameâ¦ Relax abit lar...why so nervous? Just play like normal lar. Where did your  âHIDDENâ  talent go? You flushed it down the toilet already isit? I came to watched you kukufy other people know! Not you being kukufied back!   urlLink    Spot the difference...  Did some  âAlam Sekitar workâ  after that. Well, I didnât really do anythingâ¦I was just following Soo Guan around. Followed  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   back afterwards to see his âcute bitchââ¦ DAMN, his puppy is fuKking cute. Arghâ¦makes me feel like owning one already. So cuteâ¦that Soo Guan and I canât stop playing with the puppy. She makes such cute expressionsâ¦  Soo Guan and me went shoe shopping after that at Jusco with  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   and  urlLink  Xin Yi  . The first thing we did when we reached there was to take our lunch. Bought a Big Mac and we went to Starbucks to get some coffee and seats as there was no more seats at McD. Had my first taste of beef. Iâ¦Foo Chee Liang as of today, 10 July 2004, am no long a beef virgin. It kinda tasted like chickenâ¦only that itâs sweeter. We did some stupid stuff at Starbucksâ¦ Taking pictures here and there.  urlLink  Xin Yi   even wrote a letter of ermâ¦âappreciationâ. We also had this idea of merging Starbucks and McD! Soo Guan suggested the name âMakeâBucksâ¦ Cool eh?   urlLink    10 years from now...  Had to go home early to follow my mom go do some grocery shopping at Carrefour. I feel so tired nowâ¦think I should go down and watch some tv.

      Party peopleâ¦hey its Friday night!   Ahâ¦Fridays! How time flies. Feels like Monday was just yesterday. Itâs been awhile since I last blogged. 2 days already I thinkâ¦since my last postâ¦2 fuKking days. Do you have any idea how long is that? Soâ¦miss me? No? Hmmâ¦nvm. Anyway, this week has been one of the busiest weeks I ever had. Been busy doing my bio and physic peka. FuK manâ¦some of us have to redo our physic peka just because we miss out on our inference. What a waste of timeâ¦but for the sake of beautifying my SPM certificateâ¦its worth itâ¦I think!   I am beginning to brush my teeth 3 times a day now. The first one is in the morning before my breakfast; second one is after my dinner and the third one if before I go to bed. My teeth are getting fuglier day after day due to the amount of coffee I take. Must reduce coffee intake alreadyâ¦I donât want my teeth to look brown and fugly!    urlLink    See the difference...?  Iâll need to go and scale my teeth soon. But Iâm afraid of going to a dentist. Yeaâ¦you heard me, Iâm afraid of going to a dentist! Is that such a big deal anyway? I meanâ¦who isnât afraid of going to a dentist. Just look at all those drills he hasâ¦now imagine if he/she is having PMS or somethingâ¦ Scary thoughts huh?   urlLink    Are you afraid now...?  Need to go finish off some stuffâ¦so byE! If you're bored check  urlLink  this   out. Its super funny!

      I feel so sick right now. Woke up this morning with a blocked-nose. Oh wait...my nose is always blocked in the morning. Never mind that, anywayâ¦after school, I went home took my lunch and fell asleep on the couch till 4.25. Woke up with a sore throat and rushed to Prasad after that. Prasadâs classes are so fuKking cold. I mean, imagine a classroom with 5 airconds and 3 fans all running at the same time. I was practically shivering during the last 30 minutes. Hereâs how Prasad classes look like every time.    urlLink    Brr...shivers....  Oh...today my class had a âwonderfulâ English lesson with Puan Suraya today. She was asking Hyon-Xhi and me about ermâ¦how should I put thisâ¦ our âcrushâ! WTF manâ¦I have no crushes and I donât really believe in high school relationships anymore so ME having a crush is like saying sodium is more reactive than potassium. Whether or not if Hyon-Xhi has oneâ¦I donât know. Lets just hope she doesnât go around spreading gossipsâ¦loL or Iâd be doomed!   Iâm in a dilemma now. Should I go to the Nilai Campus thingy? If I go, Iâll miss Asiahâ¦ Ahâ¦what the heckâ¦Iâll just go along with them.

      Check, check, check, checkâ¦check, check, check it outâ¦what, what, what, what, whatâ¦its all aboutâ¦ Sounds familiar? Itâs from the BEASTIBOYSâ¦ Wicked song! Well from now on my site will no longer use  Hyon-Xhiâs copyrighted  stickmen anymore. From now onâ¦my site will useâ¦*drum rolls pleaseâ¦ ORANG-ORANG!    urlLink    Evolution...  Stickmen will no longer populate my siteâ¦ Now comes the day of ORANG-ORANGâ¦ May there be peace to allâ¦    urlLink    What a joyous day for all...  Evolution usually takes millions of years to complete, however mine only takes an hourâ¦so this means  I deserve a Nobel Prize Award  for my achievements in speeding up evolution. Screw you if you think otherwise. Anywayâ¦today I shall bestow you people another picture. Accio pictureâ¦   urlLink    Mmm... Drools  Urmâ¦thatâs not me but my brother! LoLâ¦just felt like sharing with you people this wonderful picture! He just shaved his head bald. I wonder how Iâll look if I do that. He looks  sexay  and  macho  right? So full of  manliness . Bet you people are drooling alreadyâ¦ True or not? Hahaâ¦too bad heâs already taken. But fear notâ¦ for  Iâm still available!  So leave me a message if youâre interested in me. loL...  P/s: My bro is gonna screw me up if he sees thisâ¦so do me a favor and keep this a secret. If you do, Iâll send you some sexy pictures of meâ¦ Do we have a deal?

      Hmmâ¦itâs Fridayâ¦AGAIN. Time is moving so fast that yesterday seems like Monday to me. Started revising alreadyâ¦ The thought of doing badly in  SPM  freaks me out.   Anyway,  BON ODORI  is here!!! Weeâ¦itâs going to be FUN...FUNâ¦FUNâ¦ The chicsâ¦foodâ¦ aHâ¦canât wait for tomorrow. Heck, the place is so near to my placeâ¦I can just cycle thereâ¦unlike Soo Guan and the rest. Lolâ¦I wonder if they know the way there. The roads in Shah Alam are pretty confusing. Itâs all interconnected. Theyâll fuKking get lost if they donât know the wayâ¦ Thereâs like 6-8 ways to go to Stadium Matsushitaâ¦maybe I should draw a map for them. Should I?   Yes? No?  Weâll decide about that laterâ¦  My day almost got ruinedâ¦ Why? Because my cousin sis was screaming around when I was taking my evening nap. Annoying braT. Sheâs 12 years old and yet sheâs still acting immaturely. Luckily it rained today. When out to play in the rain instead since I couldnât get any sleepâ¦ Canât really remember the last time since I last played in the rain. Itâs been awhileâ¦probably 3 years. Had so much fun walking under the rain. Everyone was looking at me as though like Iâm some fuKtardâ¦ Stupid dicks with brain the size of a peaâ¦wTF manâ¦you people never walk under the rain beforeâ¦?  My bro just broke up with his girlfriend. I wonder how is he? Hope heâs okayâ¦ Relationshipsâ¦they donât fuKking last in High school or in University do they? So whatâs the point then in having themâ¦? For the heck of it? ArgHâ¦I donât knowâ¦and I donât wanna know either.  Iâm quite free nowâ¦so I might as well draw a map for themâ¦ Iâm such a  good friend .  FuK you  if you donât think so.

      These past few days have been cruel to me. Been having headaches and stomachaches since Sunday. Arghâ¦why? Why? Iâm beginning to think that its probably bad karma. Maybe Iâve been annoying  urlLink  Edna   too much. She probably got fed up and secretly put a curse on meâ¦  urlLink  Edna  â¦you  evil HOE . LoLâ¦just kidding thereâ¦  I was watching this drama yesterdayâ¦and guess whatâ¦it fuKking enlightened me. There was this guy who was advising his daughter about not seeing things from only one point of view. Their words actually smack some sense into me. Iâve always been prejudice. Their words made me feel like some pathetic lowlife whose only existence is to fukKing judge people by just looking at them. I feel so lowâ¦ All right thenâ¦from now onâ¦I shall not judge people until I get to know them. I bet  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   and  urlLink  Edna   is probably laughing their ass out while they are reading this. Never mindâ¦for I shall prove it to them that Iâm gonna stop being prejudiceâ¦    urlLink    Me...from today onwards...  Anywayâ¦todayâs Kimia lesson was seriously fun. I learned something newâ¦ I learned how to tie a girlâs hair. Guess who the guinea pig wasâ¦its non other thanâ¦ urlLink  EDNA  !!! Thanks  urlLink  EDNA  â¦you really made my day! To repay your kindnessâ¦I shall annoy you again with the Queenâs song tomorrowâ¦ Cheers to that...yAY!!!  Have to sign off nowâ¦ Need to reviseâ¦SPM is just months away!

      I got a fuKking migraine right now. Arghâ¦and just 20 minutes ago I had a combo of both migraine and stomach ache. Did someone voodoo-ed me or somethingâ¦ I think I need to practice some Taichi.   urlLink    Me...practising Taichi...  Went over to my familyâs  âRumah Pusakaâ  today for my 4th uncleâs retirement party. Lots of food was served and we had a great time mainly becauseâ¦we hadnât had any reunion since Cheng Ming. Ever since our grandmother pass away, weâve had very little reunions. Damnâ¦I miss my childhood days. Our family is now getting filled with the Xiang generation already. Iâm the last of my generation incase you donât know. Iâm the last person in the Cheeâs generation. In about 10 years time the first sons of the Xiang's generation is gonna be as old as me. Iâll probably be married by thenâ¦ Nevertheless, itâs still a long way to goâ¦

      School was fun today. Spend most of my time in the school dewan and computer lab rehearsing for the play. Damnâ¦it was seriously fun. Wei Wei as usual was playing a fool making us laugh non-stop. Donât really know how to describe Wei Weiâs acting to you peopleâ¦all I can say is he can really make you laugh your asses out. Kean Leongâ¦the tall guy was acting as the coconut treeâ¦you shouldâve seen him danceâ¦fuKking hilarious.   Skip Prasad today. Whyâ¦? I was too lazy. Fell asleep till 5.30. Hmmâ¦just a few weeks ago I was telling myself to stop playing a fool. Fukâ¦fUkâ¦fuKâ¦percubaan is just 2 weeks away. Mustâ¦study and stopâ¦playing!!!   I just noticed that I get aggravated easily. Stuffs like not waking up early when I should beâ¦not getting my coffee or tea in time and late for school seriously ticks me off. Why am I even telling you people this? Its not like you people care or anythingâ¦  True or not?

      Havenât been blogging for a few days nowâ¦been busy. I have yet to complete my PJK and Moral folio. Arghâ¦and to add to my frustration, my comp has been crashing at least 3 times a day. FukKing hellâ¦just wait till I get the Win 98 cd from Ronnieâ¦then Iâll fukKing format my comp.   Newayâ¦ Iâm acting in a school play! Yay! Soo Guanâ¦Rogerâ¦Wei Weiâ¦Terry and Shaun are in it too! Mwahahahaâ¦ As usualâ¦Roger spoilt the whole play! HAHAHAHAHAâ¦loLâ¦he keeps laughing on the stage. Stupid fellaâ¦Soo Guan also can tahan you cannot tahan isitâ¦ Better not laugh during the real playâ¦or weâll screw you up man!   Wanna know what Iâm acting asâ¦? Iâm gonna act as  âTHEâ  TONGKAT ALI! MwahahahAâ¦x100 (*the famous Austin Power laugh)  And guess whatâ¦ ROGERâs gonna be the  âimpotentâ  guy that needs me.

      Feeling tired as usual. Went to school early in the morning to do lilâ bit of banner painting and watch people getting kukufied in basketballâ¦ Banner painting was quite âfunââ¦cause I got coaxed into spending Chia Yean McD. Basketball was even betterâ¦cause Rogerâs team got fuKked in the finals by Bobbyâs team! Yayâ¦!   Went Shaunâs house after that. Had 2 âkuay pengâ for lunch cause we figure out that the food at  Bon Odori  is gonna be fuKking expensiveâ¦and guess whatâ¦it really is. I mean, 4 bucks for just a bowl of ice with nothing but lemon syrup and condensed milkâ¦ FukKing rip offsâ¦I can get 2 bowl of ice kacang for the same price! Neverthelessâ¦we still had fun there. Dancing around shouting  âOIâ â¦maNâ¦ Wouldnât it be fun if our everyday life were like that?   There were lots of chicks thereâ¦which meansâ¦ Chicks = Eyesore =  urlLink  Hyon-Xhiâs TERROR-MYCIN    Donât know what to write anymoreâ¦ Iâm too tired to think. Think Iâll sign off now. Anyway before I sign off...   HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY  urlLink ROGER!   Hope you had a nice day...

      Havenât been blogging much latelyâ¦ Was busy finishing my moral folio. Finally finished it last Thursday. Didnât really bother decorating the cover. And I have a feeling the teacherâs gonna cut my mark for âcreativityâ. FuK itâ¦who the hell cares anyway. The only reason I finished it was because I didnât wanna kukufy my own SPM certificate.  Iâm officially sick again. Damn those fuKking viruses. This is the second time in this month I got flu. My nose is blockedâ¦I canât breathe properlyâ¦and the worse thing is, mucus keeps flowing out. Arghâ¦I hate getting sick. Went to school yesterday with a depresso face and Edna thought I got dumped or somethingâ¦ loL.   Woke up today feeling  abit  better. Had a cup of teaâ¦since tea is healthier than coffee. In case you donât knowâ¦1 cup of green tea contains the same amount of caffeine as 1 cup of coffee. The only difference is that coffee contains substance that irritates your stomach. Speaking about coffee, I havenât had one since Bon Odori.   Just spend 3 hours playing FreeCell. Think Iâll go play something elseâ¦maybe minesweeperâ¦

      Yay! I finally had my first coffee after 2 weeks. And guess whatâ¦I actually forgot how good it taste. Brings back fond old memoriesâ¦oh waitâ¦was there even any memories to begin withâ¦? Hmâ¦never mind. MmmMmâ¦I can still remember how good the smell wasâ¦the aroma of coffee with caramelâ¦aHhâ¦god,  I JUST LOVE COFFEE.    I'm almost cured of my flu alreadyâ¦thanks to the godly wonders of a bowl of chicken porridge, which I ate yesterday.   Thank you chicken porridgeâ¦for curing me. I will never forget youâ¦  I actually felt better after eating it. You might think that I'm bullshitingâ¦but believe it or notâ¦I did feel betterâ¦so PISS off! Waitâ¦the word piss is just too politeâ¦I need something more impoliteâ¦hmmâ¦how bout, go  HISAP TELUR â¦? Betterâ¦? Yeah??? Okayâ¦let's start back from the beginningâ¦  *ehem* I did feel betterâ¦so go  HISAP TELUR!    Anywayâ¦just finish watching some  "corny" serial dramas back to back. That's 10 episodesâ¦in 7 hours! MuAhahhahwaahhahaâ¦I'm so good at being a couch potato! Hmmâ¦maybe I can rewatch them again laterâ¦  Signing off nowâ¦wanna go play some Minesweeperâ¦   *HISAP TELUR  = suck egg or suck ball; the word HISAP TELUR is taken from the website  suckball.com .
