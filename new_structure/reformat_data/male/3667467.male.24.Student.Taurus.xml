       CD: Gorillaz, "Gorillaz"  I was going to wait until it was officially tomorrow to write tomorrow's blog, but I have several papers to produce by tomorrow morning so I better get this out of the way. My secret problem as a future educator is that I have major procrastination problems and poor study skills. When I was in high school I did not have to study, excepting the odd French test. (My ill will towards the French ought to be documented in a later entry.) But I actually TRIED to study. I would sit there with a book and some notes and after a half hour my mind would exclaim, "I can't do it! How do people do this?" Learning seemed to come pretty automatically to me and when it didn't, I accomplished what I had to through trial and error. This probably led to my current procrastinations. There was no effect on my grades--or even my level of knowledge--no matter what amount of time I relegated to study. So I would simply do everything at the last possible minute to save the greatest period of time to other interests. Interests like, um, idleness. So I could have started writing all of these papers three days ago, formulating hypotheses, rewriting and proofreading. Get a nice big A. OR, as I had in the past, I can start my papers at midnight the night before they're due, write whatever's on my mind, and get, on average, an A-. Or an A, who knows. Come to think of it, maybe that's what I should teach the kids: sometimes it's just not worth it. You know, Preparation for the Real World. Hey, a new episode of South Park starts in 10 minutes; maybe I'll watch that first before I settle in.

       CD: Radiohead, "Kid A/Amnesiac B-Sides" [mix]  It may be simply because of the area I get my literature from, which happens to be a mostly Catholic, Democrat-run city in a state that normally elects Democrats to federal office. (Hillary Clinton? Who checked her credentials?) In any case I have never read an "alternative" paper touting a mostly rightest viewpoint. I don't have any problems with the left--well, actually I have problems with both the right AND the left--but it would be nice every once in a while to be able to pick up a paper and NOT see the A to Z on how Bush is destroying the country/economy/environment singlehandedly, and how Dick Cheney is part of a vast right-wing conspiracy to support terrorism and the oil industry and kill our precious children who, of course, would never vote for a Republican. When it comes to weeklies or other non-mainstream media, it is either moderate liberal (e.g. "Blue Dog") or socialist/Marxist. In a recent count I found 3 of each kind at a university. As for right-wing representation? Zero. Been that way for (at least) five years. Is the media really that liberal? Is this a nationwide phenomena? Is the right so entrenched in the ideology of status quo that it finds no reason to synthesize political thought with day-to-day, public conversation? Is the intelligencia of this country so far left they fail to quantify the maxims of Republicanism (that they stole under the Clinton/Gore administration)? Am I making any sense here? When it comes to political discussion, all I want is A) levity and B) brevity.

      CD: PJ Harvey, "Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea"  The goal tomorrow morning is to send out at least 8 job applications to their respective places of buisness. This, of course, has been my goal every morning since February. On some days I have sent out two or three, but most mornings my field is quite fallow. I have never been fond of applications: one, because of the paperwork, and two, I can't stand self advertisement. But it's mostly the paperwork. Princeton once sent me an application--I never asked for one so that must mean something (?)--and I decided to pass because it was 16 pages long. I only applied to two colleges, and then to only one grad school. They all accepted me, yet I'm sure this is not fear of failure I'm worried about. It's the fear that I'll have to get up in the morning and type out--AGAIN--a list of five references. And then references. "Why do you want to work...?" I don't! Eating just happens to be a prerequisite for homeostasis, and somehow I must support this dirty habit!  You may be asking yourself, "If he's spending so much time on a precocious weblog, why can't he do the same for his precious applications?" Clueless myself. This was my aim with a weblog: get back to the computer and type. About yourself. And get it done by morning!

      CD: Mouse on Mars, "Niun Niggung"  Random notes today:  --Working on my farmer's tan. No watch outlines this time!  --Why oh why are envelopes such a pain to print on? Who do you call?  --I've been using a sleeping bag since I've moved. Yes, a sleeping bag. In June. If I were rich, however, I would throw the sleeping bag on the campfire and sleep on the marshmallows. You know what I'm sayin'?  --No? Neither do I.  By the way, what does "Niun Niggung" mean?  --Grad school starts in 10 hours. This better not suck. I hope I don't get one of those "enlightened" teachers who like to use group activities and grade by participation. It's especially worse for us education majors. I should write more on this subject later.  --New World Record is giving me a Buy-1-Get-1-Free coupon for my Britney Spears haiku! Well E-mail my heart, I won something.  --15 minutes of searching, and I still can't find out what "Niun Niggung" means. Curses, Babel!

      CD: various Smashing Pumpkins: Machina-era B-sides   Just Like the Special Olympics.  Last night I got an E-mail from the independent store New World Records that said the following (paraphrases):  "These are good seats [to the Britney Spears concert], and all you have to do to win a pair (of tickets) is be one of the first three people to e-mail us with a Britney haiku* and a viable phone number. If youâre one of the [first] lucky three, weâll call you back and tell you to hustle on down here for your tickets. So hurry up and hit that âReplyâ button!"  And I did! Now, I never would have won, because I opened the E-mail six hours after it was sent out. But haikus! It's like Poetry for Dummies. I quickly wrote up and sent out a response:  She's not just a girl... Teenage pop sells soda pop My Pops likes her, too  I'm actually quite proud of that one. Not really because I thought it up in less than a minute, or that it used THREE different definitions of the slang word "pop," or that I actually participated in one of these goofy contests! No, I'm proud of it because IT WASN'T DIRTY. Oh man, the mental war I had to wage to keep it that way! The image of Britney Spears is such that one can barely keep away from risque thoughts! Even New World Record had to write:  *Remember, thatâs five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third. Neatness counts, and points will be deducted for tastelessness.  Who cares what the results say. I still FEEL like a winner.

       CD: L7, "Smell the Magic"  A real day off! Nothing pressing to do. Sleeping in was great for the constitution, as seen from my previous entry. But how to keep busy? Well, there was that whole "start excersizing" idea I once had, so I went down to the garage to find my bike, check the tire pressure and be on my way to good health and a reunion with nature. Ready to go, I open the door and . . . it's raining. I would've gone in a drizzle but this was just enough to make me turn back. For a minute I stood there under the threshold with a blank stare. "The one time I didn't want an excuse . . . . "  Luckily my new favorite satellite station, WorldLink TV, played several good documentaries about the Zapatista movement and the maquiladoras of Mexico that kept my interest a good part of the evening. But, man, I really wanted to ride my bike!

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music"  I've slept much better since I've moved. This has led to some really intriguing dreams. Last night, I was at a party with Puff Daddy. Not P. Diddy, I noticed, but good ol' Puff Daddy. Anyway, so we were just hanging out with a bunch of people. And Puffy was showing me around the place. I also noticed that whatever he did, soon everyone at the party would do. So if he was just socializing/drinking champagne, I would look around and everyone would be doing the same thing. Then he decided to lay down in the middle of the floor, where a large number of throw pillows just happened to located. Everyone else did the same. It was all very classy. He was eventually making out with someone else (everyone partnered up and did likewise) so I devoted my attention to the lady next to me, who just happened to be the dark-haired woman from Being John Malkovich. Remember? Not Cameron Diaz, but the other one. The first thing I said to her was "Have you ever noticed that when Puff Daddy drinks champagne, everyone drinks champagne?" And she replied, "And when Puff Daddy lies down, everyone lies down?" We didn't make out like the others, but we made a connection. We ended up talking very close for the rest of the night. As the party broke up in the morning, we were on our separate ways. I almost forgot to ask her for her number, but she said she'd see me at the Today Show the next morning so we'd just meet up then. Walking back to my New York City apartment that morning, I thought two things: one, I should have gotten her number anyway, and two, I was SURE she had once slept over in my dorm freshman year. No, wait, she was just there really late one night after a group outing. She must've not remembered it herself.   The night before I had this dream, I dreamt that I was walking past a group of armed soldiers, as a civilian, probably in an occupied zone. In either case I had no animosity towards them. One soldier, by mistake, shot me. The rest of the dream, I was trying verbally agitate her about the shooting; trying to make her feel sorry her gun was pointed at me--and not upwards like it was supposed to--when it went off by accident. The wound never actually hurt, but she never apologized, either.  Now what's all that supposed to mean?

      Album: Bjork: Selmasongs  I work with a group of students from the Czech Republic. Though I do not converse with them often, I have learned some of their views on American culture and politics. Most I already knew, but it was nice to hear them come from the mouths of actual foriegners.  1.) Everyone in America must have a car to survive. Everything is so far apart, it would be impossible to exist without one.  2.) Cars, however, are very inexpensive, and almost anyone can afford one. Gas is extremely cheap and the driver's tests are short and uncomplicated (Czechs must test for several hours with a uniformed policeman in the car).  3.) Public transportation in America is absolute crap. New York City is an exception.  4.) Everything is bigger here. Portions of food, lawns, suburban sprawl, roads, people. There is a lot of room.  5.) There are more abandoned buildings, unmowed lawns, and litter here.  6.) George W. Bush is unpopular for a number of reasons. One is his idea of an "Axis of Evil" for terrorism that requires military force as a solution. Another is the Kyoto Treaty, though its failure to be signed is the fault of the entire U.S. Government. The most popular presidents to Europeans are probably Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy, because of their links to European history.  7.) It's a long plane trip.  8.) Nomatter what part of the earth you're from, if you're going to the States you'll travel to Florida at least once. And if you're in Upstate New York, you'll be at Niagara Falls within a week.  9.) The United States does not agree with other countries in world affairs because it is either A) stubborn, B) doesn't know better, or C) doesn't like other countries telling it what to do. It's usually C.  10.) The French are assholes.

       Album: Soundtrack, Blues Brothers 2000  Day two and I already have writer's block.  I have tried in several other occations to write in a conventional diary. I have also attemped a poetry book which is still stagnantly awaiting a Page 5, and just the thought of what horrible wordplay I may have used in it two years ago makes me cringe. The basic idea, however, hasn't died yet. It would be nice to have SOME record of myself, even if reasons for it are few or trite. The only successes I've had in this department are for interpersonal communication, not personal introspection. For example, I save all personal IMs and E-mails. Do I look at them all later? No, and I do not share them with anyone outside of the person I originally communicate with. And I've tried my hand at photography, which is okay, but the sole purpose of that is to eventually show the pictures to somebody else. Apparently, just filling a journal with my thoughts and feelings is worthless to me. Is it because I measure their importance with a comparative societal scale? Anyway, all I know is that there is a Chance that someone will read this, and that is good enough for my efforts. Oftentimes when I am having an IM or E-mail conversation I am thinking to myself whether I will be ashamed of what I say if I read it again years from now. I especially wonder how other people will characterize me if they read "this" in the future. Someone is always watching me, even if it is only me. Better to keep my mouth shut, then.

      CD now playing: Tori Amos, "Strange Little Girls"  Finally, a first foray into a fake form of a weblog.  So last week I was in the newly built Newstead Public Library when I spotted Natalie Imbruglia's first album in the record bin. "Why not" I thought, because they're free... I have spent the entire week relistening to this album, and have only yesterday pried myself off it to save my sanity... Why do I listen to it so much? Its slyly subtle vocal deliveries? The quality of the studio musicians? Or the critical hunt for and appreciation of all its minor flaws? (They are many more I hope to find.) Nomatter. Three days ago, however, I was watching TV, trying to escape my fixation on Imbruglia's song "One More Addiction" when who else but the singer herself pops up on one of those hair coloring ads. You know, the ones with Beyonce Knowles or that Dark Angel girl? I was shocked. No, horrified. It's like those horror movies where the character finally believes their own reassurances that the house is not haunted, and then opens a closet door to see the ghost staring her right in the face. How did Natalie know?! Chilling. Later that night, a mildly familiar, comfortable nightmare. I walk down a hallway to find a room: 10,000 people at a Natalie Imbruglia concert, I find myself front row center. This is normal, and I am afraid.

      CD: Count Basie, "Ken Burns Jazz: The Definitive Count Basie"  My brother came up to me the other night and said, "Hey, I got this great new excersize. You want to know what it is?" Um, I guess? "Just do this." He squats on his knees, then stands back up, then repeats. That's all? "That's all you need, dude! Just do like a bunch of them" Oh. "After a while it gets really, really hard to do. And you can feel it working." What about jogging or biking? "Dude, this is all you need. Just do like 50 of 'em and you're all set for the day." Well then. I guess I'm sold. I didn't leave the recliner, but I considered trying a couple, for a few seconds. I was busy reading. No time for anything right now...besides it was too hot out. My brother said he was late and his ride came to pick him up. Thus endeth this week's conversation with my brother.

      CD: Van Halen, "Van Halen"  My dad was watching MTV Undressed again. I long time ago I might have tried scolding him. Usually I would just repeatedly ask him what else was on. If I was in the next room, I would tell him to turn it down at the very least. He's too old now and so am I. (Though they still check my ID at in Canada, what's up with that?) People that old (as old as him, that is) CAN learn to tricks, but they don't WANT to. So forget it. My dad comes home at night, watches TV for a few hours, and goes to sleep. That's it for him, maybe for the rest of his days. The only thing I can really do is resist that kind of entropy for the next 60 or so years. Wish me luck, dude. I've already been online for an hour now.

      CD: They Might Be Giants, "Apollo 18"  I got me a new toothbrush. It was time. The old toothbrush's surface looked like a national park after a forest fire. The dentist told me I should use soft bristles, because apparently I have tender gums, or something like that. I really can't remember because I haven't seen my dentist in five years. But I was raised with a Protestant work ethic, so when it comes to fighting cavities a little pain and bleeding is par for the course. Did you know that there are no "hard" toothbrushes at the drugstore? Only "soft" and "medium"? Well, the mediums work just fine, thank you very much. And my teeth feel great, the bristles feel hard, and the inside of my mouth feels refreshingly raw. I'm not being sarcastic! It actually seems like I'm making progress, George W. Bush Administration-style, on the War Against Tooth Decay. And though I haven't seen a whole lotta progress yet, I'm sure that with a larger annual budget I'm going to be just fine. Now if I can just get myself to floss regularly...

      CD: various, "Ultra-Lounge 4: Bachelor Pad Royale"  Well you got your Leninist-Marxists and you got your Socialists and you got your Leftests and you got your Greens and you got your Moderate Liberals and then you got your Reactionary Democrats. And they all publish at least one paper that comes out here in Buffalo. And I might actually throw my support to some of these people were not their banter so redundant, trite, and prejudiciously partisanin terms of their treatment of the conservatives and the Republicans. I mean, really, none of these papers are actually saying anything different from one another, yet you have half a dozen papers telling me that Al Gore should have won the election. Back when I was impressionable, I skimmed my father's "Solidarity" magazine, which he got in the mail for being in the UAW. And even when I was 10 and couldn't tell the difference between Democrat, Republican, VHS, or Beta, I could tell that information was skewed to far to be trusted. In comparison it took me two more years to get the same feelings for Rush Limbaugh. If the conservatives wrote as many papers as these guys did I say the same stuff, but at least those guys aren't wasting my time like with the public propoganda of People's World Weekly.

      CD: various, "That Virtua Feeling: Sega and Sub Pop Get Together"  It has become my goal in life to drive my bought-new 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier into the ground. Oh yes, it will be done. When bought, I told my insurance company it would be driven about 10,000 miles a year. Pretty generous, seeing that beforehand I was driving about 3000 miles a year--just to work and back, mostly. But with a new car--a car that won't have to be in the shop every other week--my driving urges became more ferocious. Now there are over 20,000 miles on my car, in only the first 16 months. I am also planning on driving to Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Nashville within the coming weeks. Which reminds me, I better get my oil changed. And my tires rotated! Hell, I drove 150 miles today and I can't even remember where I went. Well, better get to bed, I've got a long drive tomorrow as well.

      CD: Sonic Youth, "Washing Machine"  So I ran a red light. At two in the morning, in a small village, two blocks from where I was going to drop someone off. I am not upset, or feeling it's somehow unfair. I did a ton of other things in that car that day that could have gotten me in worse trouble. (Everyone says I'm a bad driver.) It is a bit ironic that my first recorded traffic infraction occurred when I was doing one of the least dangerous things possible--not stopping at a quite visibly empty, small-town intersection--but nevertheless I will change my ways. In terms of karma, this ticket was well-deserved. Too many times have I just missed a yellow light (a notorious signature of Buffalo drivers), or used an exit at the last second. And when I went in for a defensive driving course, once the guy just gave me the insurance reduction for free because no one else showed up. This has been a long time coming. I am a new man! Pretty much. I did the speed limit all the way home!

      CD: Ozomatli, "Ozomatli"  Chore night. After several days of who-knows-what (schoolwork, traveling, etc.) that keeps a person away from basic maintenance, I can take that extra hour to concentrate on the smaller details of life. Like folding some of that laundry I didn't get to finish. Maybe reading some of that already mail I picked up yesterday. Organizing my CD collection back into their cases. Emptying out my "To Be Filed" folder (when it's the biggest folder in the cabinet, time to start sorting). Normally I'm pretty neat (and tidy, too  ) so it's odd and somewhat disconcerting to see these three or four things out of place. I'm such a disappointment. Tisk tisk. Which reminds me, I've got some letters to send out!

      CD: Shel Silverstein #3 (homemade compilation)  I was at a show yesterday that tried really really really to cater to the Extreme part of society. You know, the snowboarding/BMX/Do the Dew kind of people created by Madison Avenue. Everyone had a pretty good time, but some of it was kind of forced upon us. Stop asking us if we're having a good time! And while we're at it, you can only say "I can't HEAR you!" so many times.   But like I said, it was still a good show. The Extreme people got to see their favorite Extreme sports, the new rockers got to see some decent bands, and the moshers got some action in, too. Preferably, I like the mosh pit far away from myself, so I try to stay somewhere on the side or farther back in the middle. Yesterday, a Second Mosh Pit started behind me as well, creating a Mosh Sandwich. In the center of the sandwich was a two year old kid, who was held by a father that carried the boy in the left hand and kept the crowdsurfers at bay with the right. Nothing happened, but why? Why would you take a two year old child to an environment of adult substances and loud adult language, and then take them to a crowded area next to people that are literally trying to punch each other in the face? Well, I don't have all the answers. Maybe they couldn't find a babysitter that night.

      CD: Primus, "The Brown Album"  I've got 3 minutes to write an entry! What to say what to say! Gotta go watch my favorite show. Then I gotta do some laundry. Then I gotta work on a research paper. Then I gotta get some sleep! It's already 12:30 in the morning! Why don't I do these things during the day? Oh well. Always something to watch or somewhere to go instead. Always another errand to run that could wait until tomorrow but probably shouldn't. Always have to get up and use the bathroom or get a snack or some water. Hey, I could go for some water right now. Awful hot day, it was. Water would be nice. Hey, one minute left! I'll spend it going to the kitchen sink.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Down On the Upside"  I ran out of space to put my CDs...again. I am also way behind on cataloging; I can only estimate that I have about 800 CDs right now. Yes, the CD burner has help, as well as the Napster standbys. But I just bought 4 CDs in Toronto the other day and I know I'm going back in a couple weeks to find some more. Sick, sick, sick. In the same vein, today I tried catching up on my periodicals reading, as I have a stack of about 2 weeks worth of newspapers and other assorted rags I haven't plowed through yet. I'm almost done with that task. (A lot of those rags concern music and, vicariously, new CD reviews.) Today I thought to myself that if I lived in any other generation I would have never even considered the concept that there was too much information to digest. But I went to 20 other websites before I started this entry, just because I had stuff I wanted to look up. Have you ever thought to yourself, "I have to stop reading, turn of the radio and TV, and do something completely monotonous to reset my mind"? Are we lucky for this? Sometime I should write about how much of this information is actually informative. Gee, listen to me, I just finished listening to Radiohead and this is what happens. I have to go fold some laundry now; until tomorrow.

       CD: various, "Just Say Roe"  Today I got an E-mail from myself, telling me I may win a Super Summer Holiday Vacation Thingy if I fill out the appropriate information at some alphanumerically named website. It was from an old TomServo0 I used to use in my college days and had lost the password. Whoever took it over and sent out the mail should have considered, possibly, to not E-mail another address of the guy's that he took. Don't you think? Then I wouldn't have to find out about it and shut him down. The same thing apparently happened to one of my father's addresses and when we found out and checked, there were 999 E-mails in his outbox. In conclusion, it was nice that someone actually sent me an E-mail, even if it was from myself. It made my day so much I even wrote this little letter about it. Yay! Now to Chuck for the weather.

What's she up to now? No kidding! Oh, yeah I'm still in school. Oh, I study education at Buffalo State now. I'll probably do that for year and then get a job. What are you doing now? That's cool. Really? Since when? That's great. Man, you're on your way. Yeah, he's still around, I talked to him a couple of days ago. Did you know he moved? No, he likes it a lot there. He'll be in the area in a few weeks. Hehe, that's just like the time.... I know, I know. It just costs so much now. So what are you doing this weekend? Neither am I. We should do something. I dunno. We always have this problem! Hey, that's an idea. Who else would want to go? Hmm. Dude, yeah! Call him up. That would be cool. Okay, and I'll call.... Yeah but then I'll call you at seven after I call her. Something like that. Cool, it's a plan. Should we do something else afterwards? Yeah, we'll see. This could be cool. Oh, okay. Well I'll call you then. Yeah, good to see you again! Crazy coincidence.... Uh huh. Yeah, hehe. Okay, I'll see you later!

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, "Poses"  I've been working on my lack of a diet. No, actually I've just been thinking about it. I'm not the healthiest person in the world, but I am not fat either; nevertheless I concern myself with what I eat. This is mostly because what I eat is a whole pile of crap. Ramen noodles. Chocolate brownies. Several bowls of Corn Flakes. Or is it what I DON'T eat? An ample number of fruits? A steady intake of fiber? My problem is that I might eat one meal during the day, and then, right before I go to bed, I say "Well, you can eat a little something before bed, you are a bit malnourished right now." Bam, half a casserole is downed. I really gotta work on those portions. No wait, take off the "s" of the last word in that sentence. And no more brownies for breakfast, either...

      CD: CMJ New Music Monthly, March 2001  It rained today! But not too much that we had clear skies tomorrow. That means there could be rain tomorrow! Not too shabby. I like sunny days--I've been working on my farmer's tan--but the heat is so oppressive that I don't know what to do with myself. Lately it means I fall asleep after doing something extremely physical, like getting the mail or eating a sandwich. Another problem with summer weather is that it's not spring or fall, when it's comfortable to do any outside exercise. Autumn is good because you can get just enough of a workout to get a sweat and still warm yourself up. It evens out! But in the summertime you fry (I'm peeling skin off right now) and melt at the same time. If you're in an empty wading pool at the time you can simmer in your own juices. Even if that happened, it'd be to hot to eat yourself! Rain, rain, come again, you my very bestest friend...

       CD: various, burned 4/20/00  I was just watching TV Land when they played one of those Classic Commercials. Remember the old Wendy's ad where they're at a Soviet fashion show, and the Eveningwear, Sleepwear, and Swimwear are the same outfit? That's a good one. The music makes it. What good commercials are out there today? I remember the Super Bowl ad for E*Trade with the cymbal-playing monkey. Or something like that. Either way, they made a point of how they wasted $2 million on the ad, but they can show you how to invest your money smartly. Funny monkey! The Chili's ads for Baby Back Ribs were good, but only the first one. The rest were pretty redundant. Then they added N*Sync (what's with the asterisks?) where Chili's totally sold out. I like the Little Caesar's ad with the kid trying to release the Free Crazy Bread back into the wild. ("You're free, crazy bread, go go go!") The Blockbuster video game ads are good. Like the one guy that didn't stop playing games for days and started to smell bad? Then the store manager walks by and sniffs him and keels over, and then the one worker goes "Yes, we're closing early!" But I digress.

      CD: Black Label Society, "Sonic Brew" (It beats saying Natalie Imbruglia again, doesn't it?)  Maybe I don't want to look for a job. Maybe I don't want a lucrative career. Maybe I don't want to get a more expensive education. Maybe I only watch auto races for the crashes. Maybe some of the things I do are illegal and I don't care. Maybe I'm not a patriot. Maybe I'm not a capitalist. Maybe I have serious emotional problems. Maybe you're right after all. Maybe I should have admitted that sooner. Maybe I should be asleep right now. Maybe I don't work hard enough to earn what I make. Maybe I will always be a corporate tool. Maybe jingoism is an admirable quality. Maybe I should work more on my posture. Maybe everyone's a racist. Maybe I'm the most racist person I've met. Maybe things are better now. Maybe the world is digging a hole instead of building a tower. Maybe this weblog is a bad idea. Maybe someone will read this post and adversely affect my life because of it. Maybe intelligence makes you synical. Maybe I'm a compete idiot.

      CD: Spacehog, "The Hoggysey"  The worst procrastination happens now, when your eyes start to get tired and you say to yourself "I should really get some sleep. That's the most important thing. I can just get up earlier in the morning..." It almost always never works. The snooze alarm is the most diabolical invention known to mankind, even more destructive than the atomic bomb....And so again I succumb to its powers. Tonight I will rest--only for a little while, I pray--with the alarm clock far away from my bed. I will remove it from arms' length in order to fulfill the promises made to my weakened constitution. Victory may still be ours in our time.   On a similar note, if another job application asks me about my Philosophy of Education one more time, I might FIND my temper...

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island"  (Yes, again. I know I have a problem.)  Swearing is fun, but it wears out its welcome quickly. It also sounds somewhat grating to others and should never be spoken around children. (Though I doubt that if we did that unrestricted that children's minds would be adversely affected.) The funnest of all is making up your own curse words! Here is a short list of some of the ones I use.  Shiznit! Frickin' A! Jiminy Cricket! Jim Crow! Sunnuva! Nizzuts! Bloody 'eck! Well I'll be dipped in peanut butter sauce! (Thanks Wayne) Tang! Hooey! Sheepskin! W! Frenchy McFrench!  And since I'm too busy listening to Natalie Imbruglia to remember the rest of them, I'll make a few new ones up:  Shibby! (Thanks Steve) Urge to kill rising! (Thanks Jim) Fang! Egrecks! Peter Frampton! Stu-stu-studio! Gingerbread! (Thanks Dave) McFly! Fran-CIS! Effing Tower!  See? It's fun AND easy. Try it today!

      CD: Drain S.T.H., "Horror Wrestling"  When you think of America, what comes to mind? I was talking with someone from the Czech Republic today about July 4th. I mentioned some of the little facts I knew, like the Declaration of Independence was signed before July 4th, so Independence Day really isn't Independence Day. (Actually, since the Treaty of Paris acknowledging America's independence wasn't signed until 1783....Anyway.) She knew about the Boston Tea Party, but because of her accent I thought she said the cause of it was "Texas." After figuring it out I added that the "Texas" Americans had to pay were the lowest in the British Empire, and therefore probably the world. So sometimes when I think about America, I think it is a nation of whiny brats who like to eat. But on a more positive note, America is, well, so UN-American. On the 4th of July we sing our national anthem (British, look it up), drink beer (German), light firecrackers (Chinese) and celebrate our system of government (Roman, Greek, British, Iroquois, French, etc.) and our independence from foreign oppression (?) All of this country used to be owned by Natives, and we either got it from them or the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, Mexicans, Russians, Canadians, Hawaiians, or countless other people, usually by force or unfair land dealings. The Statue of Liberty was built in France. New York City is the home of the United Nations. And on and on. So if anything, be thankful that we are a nation of people from around the world who have worked harder than anyone to deserve the right to become whiny brats who like to eat. And if America=the world, God bless Americans.

       CD: Stone Temple Pilots, "No. 4"  Jeff is drunk. Sometimes drunk can be funny, like Otis. But sometimes it can be annoying, or disgusting, or even scary. On the internet, however, it's only funny! Jeff just can't spell, that's all. Like this example:  (12:49:23 AM): we hvae to git tehere earliy (12:49:28 AM): it is bizzy (12:49:35 AM): 10 but bixzy (12:49:42 AM): earli!! qw git htere (12:49:48 AM): poops - sorryyy (12:49:58 AM): pskkrf (12:50:05 AM): pakked (12:50:14 AM): bizzy!  THAT is comedy. The best part is that they can't see you laughing at everything they say, and you can make it look as if you're taking all their statements with absolute seriousness. My favorite part is when they just start apologizing for things: for being a bad friend, for being drunk, for something that may or may not have happened two months before. Jeff's not doing that now, but if he were this would be SO much cooler.   On a lighter note, I hope the terrorists aren't attacking us today, because July 4th is a great symbol of our independence but it also means 42% of our nation is drunk at any given time. Then again, the rest of us are either in uniform or armed with firecrackers and guns--even the kids--so I guess we'll be alright. So as the 9th District Court says, ___ Bless America and goodnight...  (12:45:30 AM): gte wrodl is psinning rihgt onw1

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island"  Currently trying to beat the heat. Fans are an obvious tool, but they are noisy and they blow in your face, causing one to feel even more tired than before. Air conditioning is even better, but for those of us who don't have air conditioning, piggybacking is required. Go to a restaurant instead of cooking. See a movie at the theater instead of watching television. Visit the public library instead of reading your mail/newspaper/books at home. But the best way to fend off the high temperatures? Ice cream. Oh yes. Half gallons on sale for $2.99 today; stock up and ride it out. Only 60 days until Labor Day...

      CD: New Order, "Substance"  Three different factors can factors can create a feeling of fatigue. One of them is excessive heat, which slows the body down as it tries to cool off when it is 90+ degrees outside. A second is a lack of sleep, which can happen when one procrastinates on their grad school assignments resulting in two poor hours of sleep. [Please see previous post.] A third symptom is overeating, like when someone's personal "Finish It Off" diet plan requires that someone eat the last half of their mother's goulash casserole (yes, such a thing exists). All three of these factors met today for the first time at 2:30 PM EST in Western New York, where the author of this post remained completely incapacitated for much of the rest of the day. Scarily, the victim assesses that these same factors may again rejoin for a second deadly assault in about one hour. We'll keep you up-to-date with information as we get it.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Talking Book"  At my school, the age of the average student is 26, meaning that in most cases they have better things to do than sit around in a classroom. They usually want to retrain or get some sort of certification or are there for the fun of it, which I have seen but still don't believe. The school attempts to accomodate all of these things, but for anyone trying to get an education straight through will find a crooked path. In one of my classes, "Mentoring Seminar," the idea is that each student already has a job in our career and is working with someone with experience at the workplace to be their "mentor." This is true of 5 out of 12 students in the class, meaning the other 7, and the teacher, have no idea what to do next. And, of course, this prerequisite wasn't mentioned to anyone beforehand. If she drops the students (like myself) that don't meet the supposed "prerequisites," she has to cancel the class, which she can't do. And I need my gull durned credits! This will be an interesting month.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Music of My Mind"  After haggling with a workable student schedule, and then submitting FIVE different versions of it to the Registrar's Office, then petitioning a professor to add me to her class, only to fail to fail in that attempt, I will be taking nine credit hours this semester. Luckily, I took a class in the summer, keeping me on track with a full-time courseload. One class I was especially happy to get into was abbreviated in the class listing as "CRIT ISS MUS STU". "Cool," I thought, "Critical Issues in Muslim Studies! This is perfect considering the state of the world. I could really get into this one." While buying the books I noticed they seemed to discuss art and other strange topics not directly involving politics. "Cool," I thought, "They're going to look at this from a completely different angle: a cultural standpoint and our interpretations of that standpoint." Then I get into class, and ignore what was written on the board until one minute before class starts: "Critical Issues in Museum Studies". Doh! Well, it meets my requirement so I'm staying. Jiminy.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Flower" EP  I got an E-mail forwarded to me that was supposed to be some sort of "Proud to be an American" statement but instead ended up being a rant in the vein of nativist jingoism. It starts by saying the author was upset a Florida judge allowed a Moslem woman to get her driver's license photo taken with only her eyes showing. Poor us, this is competely against our American ideals! Why, if this woman wants to be in OUR country, that's fine, but she should conform to OUR moral values and OUR way of life. This person, who may have left her country of origin to escape religious persecution, should assimilate with the culture she moved to, not impose her exclusive culture on those she meets here! That's just plain un-American! So have you ever been so infuriated by someone's comments you didn't know what to say first? I deleted the E-mail.

      CD: Weezer, "Maladroit"  This fall I will either sleep until noon every day and do homework out of sheer boredom, or I will get up at 5 every morning and fall asleep at the wheel driving back from college late some night. I have signed up to be a substitute teacher in three different schools, and if they call me I become a rich but very busy man. One thing I didn't know about substitute teaching is that in some schools, you don't even need a bachelor's degree--or have taken education courses in college, for that matter--to work. Fifty bucks for six hours of work is not really much to scoff at, considering you could be cleaning toilets for about as much instead. But that's with a union toilet-scrubbing job. Then again it would be cheaper to scrub the toilets and not have to pay for decent dress clothes and ties you'd have to wear every day of the week. Of course, you go to work simply to afford things like decent dress clothes and ties. Well maybe not ties; I was never a big fan of them. I have gotten used to them, however, which is good, and nowadays I don't have to go online and ask Jeeves "How do you tie a tie?" anymore. I keep the link in my Favorites menu anyway, just for sentimental value, I guess. In fact, when was the last time I cleaned out my Favorites? November 9, 2001. Now I know. Knowing is half the battle. Knowledge is power. The power is in your hands. You're in good hands with AllState. Quaker State motor oil gives your engine protection beyond 3000 miles. I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more. More selection means better savings. Wider is better. You should know better. Knowing is half the battle...

      CD: Vertical Horizon, "Everything You Want"  Recently I've become addicted to a television show, which is horrible because 1) I really don't have the time and 2) the show is ninety minutes long. It's called The Screen Savers and is on the TechTV channel, oh, about five times a day. The premise is simple: a bunch of people talking about a new computer gadgets, taking help calls from viewers, and interviewing other people who apparently know what they're talking about when it comes to computers. It fascinates me because I'm interested in the half of the show I understand and I wish I could understand the other half of the show I don't. The best part is when something called "The Screen Savers Effect" happens on the show, which is when someone tries to demonstrate a new application or website and the thing just refuses to work. Dude, that totally like happens to ME all the time! So now I have to learn how to read textbooks and newspapers and watch television at the same time. At least the show is educational in that regard...

      CD: Bikini Kill, "Pussywhipped"  This summer my subconcious has almost taken over. It's fascinating and scary at the same time. I think it started during my many ours alone in the car, singing to myself and cursing me out whenever I'm just about to merge into heavy traffic. Recently, these verbalizations have found me on the sidewalk, at work, or while watching television. Usually they consist of only one or two words--if that--but they can border on Tourette's every once in the while. This only happens when I am alone in a place, so it is nothing like the truly crazy people you see talking to themselves along a New York City street. But why am I doing them? Why were I not prior? Will it make me "CRAAAAAYZEEEE?" It's like mumbling incoherent things in your sleep, but instead I'm awake at the same time. I hope it's not chronic schizophrenia; that would be a demon hell ride, making me laugh like a crazy clown in the Bozo circus . . . .

      CD: Memphis Minnie, "Queen of the Blues"  In a recent post I mentioned my cat, Billy, and his addiction to marijuana. Which brings me back to the post I wrote the other night, about going to the Tool concert. The opening band was Tomahawk, some sort of new collaboration with a member from Faith No More, another guy from Jesus Lizard, etc. And I'm sure they sounded great. This would have been a verifiable statement, had not my brother and sister (A family outing!) gone with me to make it by the 7:30 start time, instead of leaving the house at 8:00. Why so late? The two music lovers wanted to Smoke Up before they left.   Which brings me back to my cat, Billy, and his addiction to marijuana. About 4 years ago I came home and found an open box marked "Cat High" in large, cursive marker. "What's this?" I asked my brother, inquisitively.  "Heh heh hehhhhhhhh . . . .  Nothin!"  I assumed the label on the box was literal, and later found out I was right. During parties with friends, sometimes my brother would light up a bowl of weed, put a box over it, and put the cat in the box for a few minutes. I hear that during one hilarious episode the cat started walking all crooked (they don't always land on their feet!), leaning against the wall, and then ralphed in a corner. This would explain why the cat meows after it's let out, not before, why its skinny and and always has the munchies, and why its eyes are, well, glassy. Like a smoked glass? Anyway the statute of limitations is probably already out for giving hash to the cat, and since there's no moral/happy ending to the story . . . uh, I forgot.

We were down in Orlando last spring . . . . Anyway we all got salmonella and Rob got it BAD. Like he was shakin' and stuff, and shitting blood and everything, right? So one night we're getting back real late to the motel and Rob like can't make it . . . . And he just gets down and takes a SHIT, right there on the boardwalk! It was the fuckin' funniest thing I've ever seen! Hah ha ha . . . !   I don't have anything to add to this, except: if your cousin is so sick he has to deficate blood on the street, is it really funny? Oh well. But I feel bad for the people making out under the boardwalk . . .

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Binaural"  At one point at work last week I was looking for a cardboard box full of paper bags. I never found it. I looked in the storage room, but to no avail. After asking a manager where they were, he said "try the next room, where they keep the stuff for the gift shop." If there is an overflow of stock, as there usually is during the peak summer months, my work is able to use the other store's storage space. To make a short story shorter, I did not know what the box of bags actually looked like, so I had to pry open a few of the packages. After about 10 minutes of searching a cramped little storage room--one you can't walk in and should be able to find things without actually looking--I got frustrated, tore a slit in the top of an unmarked box and stuck my hand in. What was inside shocked me. It sure wasn't paper bags, but soft. And furry. And at the same time, a co-worker unknowingly from behind their sneakers squeaking.   Fur + Squeak  = Alive!   I pulled my hand back and went "AAAAAAHH!"   "What's wrong?" the co-worker asked. "I thought it was alive! And I got scared! Geez!" I tried to breathe. She looked at the plain cardboard box, then me. "Oh Kayyy..." and resumed walking.  I wish the gift shop would label their crates of stuffed animals, but I'm in no position to dictate.

      CD: Medeski Martin  Wood, "Uninvisible"  There are primal instincts that all mankind must succumb to at one time or another. Perhaps it is the drive to perpetuate the species, or increase heartrate when threatened. Today, without thinking, I tried to protect my nads from getting stepped on by my cat. For whatever reason, I have a cat that loves stepping on my nads. I could be reading the newspaper, or sitting and eating, or lying down asleep. This cat (whose name is Billy, after Billy Corgan [not my decision] by the way) will somehow find an excuse to jump up to my lap area and then wander around. This results in a repeated number of passes over my reproductive organs whilst walking very, very deliberately. Then, after about the third pass, the cat starts pawing at the rocky "ground" as if attempting to achieve better footing. This will involve claws, but they are not very sharp or heavily utilized. I still fail to understand why the cat will walk on my nads but not my legs, shoulders, or torso when they are available to him. Always--without fail--straight for the nads.   Today I was lying down, and on my side. Therefore, there was no logically feasible way the cat COULD step on my nads, even if it WANTED to. But when the cat jumped on to the sofa, and near my waist, I instantly hinged my body so my knees ended up almost against my chest. I was awed by my sense of reflex, and then by my stupidity. More about Billy the Cat later, as he is the only cat I know of who is a recovering marijuana addict; like it sounds, it's a long story.

      CD: moe., "dither"  Once again, I have missed the Fair. The Erie County Fair ("second largest county fair in America!" the brochure exclaims) was held from August 8 to August 18, and guess what day it is. I have only been to the Fair one time, and that's when I was about 8 years old. There was a really big sandcastle, and a bunch of tractors, and ice cream, and funhouse mirrors and it smelled like poo and feed! We had a really fun time. Ever since then I've wanted to go back but NO, I've been out of town or working or couldn't find anyone to go with me or it was raining or some other silly reason. Alas, one more year of waiting before I see a demolition derby, or get reminded as to what all the H's stand for in 4H, or walk by a cheap excuse for a Ferris Wheel and think "I don't wanna waste my tickets on that, either." Phooey!

      CD: Blue Oyster Cult, "Secret Treaties"  George W. Bush is an excellent puppet president. Thirty years from now, or however long it is supposed to take, I'm sure the documents will be released to show that Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld and the like were running the whole show. But is that a bad thing? I mean really. In a time where we have to deal with Middle East peace problems and threats of oil embargos, broken agreements between Israel and Palestine, and the Saudi Arabian question, who else is better equipped to lead than people who not only have experience in the area, but have actually fought a war there and won? So we know that something will get done. What we don't know is how many people will get killed, civilian or otherwise, in the Arabian subcontinent as a result of some old American codgers wishing they had done it right the first time and gone General Sherman on Saddam's regime. And thirty years from now, to look back and say this country was so powerful it would pick fights with any poor, dysfunctional kid on the playground isn't going to get us anything but dirty looks at the P.T.A. meetings. I do not fear any problems with the U.S.'s economy, infrastructure, or public security under the Second Bush Administration, but I do believe America is trying to clean the loaded gun we leave around the house. Think about the children!

      CD: various, "Hopeless Records Winter/Spring 2002 Sampler"  The public library down the street is where I should be spending more of my time. Why I am not probably includes Television in its equation, something that says a lot about my recent bouts with sloth in these summer months. The new library has free, high-speed internet access. My house will not let me get past 33.6. The new library has air conditioning. My house has ten fans that can't get the temperature under 80. The new library gets Rolling Stone and has comfortable chairs. My house? The UAW newsletter and a couch with my father in his underwear. The new library is a two minute walk from Chinese take-out dishes. My house is a Petri dish for flies to feast on. I hope someday to become such an influential citizen of a town that they name a room of their local library in my honor, which I can move into permanently. Until then, I'll have to remember due dates and sweat in my spare time.

      CD: MP3 CD, cont'd (current track: Sex Pistols, "Anarchy in the U.K.")  Today I planned on going to Lackawanna for an optional job interview, optional because it was for an entry level job, nobody called me, and the only notice I had for it said anyone "interested" in the job "may" come by. It was supposed to be from 9 AM to noon.   What follows is the remarkable story of one person's ineptitude, ignorance, and bad luck. Firstly, I got 2 1/2 hours of sleep the night before. That is bad for an interview. It is also bad for anyone that has to wake up early, because it disables the Willingness to Wake part of the brain at seven in the morning. So after being late leaving town, It was time to find this Oz, this Mecca, this District Administration Building. 30 Johnson Street. And for the first time in my history of using Yahoo! maps (why the exclamation?) it was completely and utterly and unknowingly incorrect. Not only did it take me to James Street, not Johnson Street, but James Street is about 50 yards long with no buildings, at least none that weren't empty. I found out quickly that Lackawanna has three types of homes: housing projects, housing projects that try to look like real houses, and real houses that look like housing projects trying to look like real houses. Driving around in a tie, listening to Natalie Imbruglia, was like Mr. Dreysdale coming to visit. Luckily I had several sets of maps with me because I have a history of getting lost even a mile from my home. Also, it's not that I don't want to ask for directions, it's that I hate people. Anyway, after driving past it twice I did find 30 Johnson Street, and after two more passes I found the parking lot. The building was grey like the rest of the town, but it was also very dark inside. Too many thoughts passed through my conscience. It took me an hour to get here even without getting lost, would I want to drive an hour to work every day? I'm too tired for a good interview. I don't need an interview anyway; they've already sent me the tax forms. I'm half an hour late and it would be an embarassment to everyone involved. I don't WANT to go in. Is anyone even here? Eventually I reached the conclusion that the job was worth trying for, but it wasn't worth going in for the interview.   For the life of me I will never, ever understand why that last sentence makes sense to me. I never got out of the car. I drove off to do other errands instead. Quickly I found that I was five blocks from my friend Dave's house in Blasdell, eight blocks from where I was caught running a red light last month, and ten blocks from where I paid $120 in parking tickets as a plea bargain for that red light just one week ago. Ineptitude, ignorance, and bad luck. Today all of these things came full circle.

      CD: MP3s CD (current track: Blues Brothers, "Soul Man")  The other weekend I was at home at night with my parents. But let's not dwell on that. Anyway, at 11:30 my mother says "Hey, isn't Saturday Night Live on?"   She really wanted to watch it! As if she was always watching it. I thought she hadn't seen the show since John Belushi was alive. When was Mom interested in pop culture? Now I find out that she's a big Chris Farley fan, as well as Will Farrell. These were the same people and skits that were a "bad influence" on me years ago, and "Why are you staying up so late when church is tomorrow?" Now it's because my parents wanted to stay up late and not let us know they were laughing at it. To the casual observer, someone would think I am exposing my past ignorance by saying this. Instead, it only proves one of my earliest hypotheses: they are NOT having sex behind closed doors. EVER.

      CD: my CD of MP3s (current song: Ani DiFranco "In or Out (live)"  Why Fred? I still don't understand why my parents thought it was the 1979 thing to do to name me Fred, not Jimmy or Ayatollah or Fonz or whatever name was actually popular back then. Fred is a family name from my mother's side; I have a deceased great-grandfather and an uncle with that name. Nevertheless, it would be nice to know other Fred People. I meet maybe one every other year, not that I'm looking hard. Usually they're wearing nametags, like mechanics or delivery men. I'm not so good with my hands, but I play some piano. Hmm, Frederic Chopin played piano. But still! I would have never met him. And my parents, who listen to things like Ringo Starr's solo work and that "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" song weren't exactly thinking along the lines of anything French. Ugh, the French.  I'm not staying on point. The point is--and I do have one--Fred is a horrible name for the new millenium. It has actually became more popular in the last decade, up to about 400th on the Most Popular Boys' Names list. 400th! My brother's name, Tim, is in the 20s, while my sister, Hannah, is nearing the top 10. To use webspeak, WTF? I was gipped. I could have been a Carl or a Tom or William, or something whacked-out-but-cool like Dakota, Dolemite or Velvet, but NO. Name me after some average Canadian guy from 1868. I'm going to go cry myself to sleep now.  No I won't. Freds don't cry. Unless they drop a hammer on their foot.

      CD: CMJ New Music Monthly, Vol. 88, December 2000  My CD collection is Important Business. Not that the CDs are very good, or that I've spent a great deal on them. But I listen to a lot of music, and when it comes to recordkeeping I'm Rain Man. My 753 CDs are now enjoying their new home in a plastic shelving system recently bought from OfficeMax. (Except the 200 that wouldn't fit.)  Some foreign coworkers have asked me to put together an MP3 CD for them, and being the great American Music Lover I am, I've decided to go all out. Two hundred songs from 200 artists. Looking through my collection, I'm finding stuff that I completely forgot about. Like my Snoopy's Christmas With The Royal Guardsmen album. Or the fact that I put Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" and Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music" at the end of Jane's Addiction's "Ritual De Lo Habitual." Or that I can listen to Kermit the Frog sing "(It's Not Easy) Bein' Green ANYTIME I WANT. Or that I got a copy of "Bachelor Pad Royale Vol. 4" from none other than my hyper-conservative former roommate Micah. Or that I own four times more Smashing Pumpkins songs than the Smashing Pumpkins released. Or that I have at least 5 CDs that I actually sing on. (There's one I've never told anyone about, called "Green Pancakes and Soup" that no one must EVER hear.) Or that I did have the cultural aptitude to purchase the complete Beethoven symphonies. Or that some of these Nirvana recordings are going for $60 on EBay. Or that the first CD I ever bought was "Chant" by the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos. I could go on, but the CD I'm listening to has 30 seconds left. Goodnight, and listen to more Ozomatli.

      CD: various, "What's Up Matador disc 1: Favorite Tracks"  A couple of entries ago I mentioned Dave, a friend of mine from Blasdell, New York. After I called him from the village courthouse there (it took a couple tries, the phone is primitive) Dave invited me to come over for a couple of hours, which, just like Dave, is very nice of him to do. Anyway, Dave's family has two dogs that I can recall: a larger black one that ARF BARK ARR!s and a more lilliputian one that YIP AYE AR!s At a previous visit to Dave's residence the larger dog was not happy to see me. It was late at night, the lights were on, and s/he probably thought I was going to rob Dave's Mom's Precious Moments figurines. Even worse, for some reason dogs stick their noses very close to my testicles. An angry dog, then, is cause for concern. This time, things seemed to be going well.   Until I opened the door a little too long. "Who let the dog out?" asked Dave, without intentionally referencing popular culture. "Oh, sorry. Um, sorry." I'm not much help. Dave disappeared in the kitchen. I was halfway to telling him he was going in the wrong direction when he reappeared with an individually wrapped slice of cheese. Dave and his younger brother Nathaniel went walking down the street, both with half a slice of cheese in one hand. "C'mon!" they would beckon. "Cheese! Cheese!" It took three minutes tops to get that dog back from the neighborhood. But afterwards, that dog treated me like the local butcher, polite forevermore because I gave him Freedom for a brief shining moment. I wonder, is this how they enforced the Fugitive Slave Act?

      CD: various, "You Are Here Magazine Number 9"  Three day's ago a woman came into my work with her four-year-old son. Give or take a year. By far he is the most charming person I had ever met there. We had a short but very pleasant conversation before her mother shuffled him along.  Boy: Hi, what's your name? F:   I'm Fred. Boy: Your name is Fred? F: Yep. What's your name? Boy: I'm Kevin. F: Hi Kevin! K: Do you have any pets? F: I have some cats. K: I have a fish. He's all mine and he's nobody else's. F: Do you play with him? K: And my sister has a hamster. F: Do the hamster and the fish ever play together? K: No, they're not near each other. F: Oh, I see. K: You have pet cats. F: Does your fish have a name? K: Yes. F: ... K: Do you know what kind of hamster she has? F: No, what kind? K: It's a GERBIL. F: Ooh, neat! Mother: Okay, Kevin, follow Mommy...

      CD: Nine Inch Nails, "The Fragile"  I live in a small hick village with lots of average white people. My house lies inbetween two trailer parks and is surrounded by a power station, a hardware store, a funeral parlor, an abandoned railroad track turned bike path, and a couple empty plots of land. None of this, however, compares to the even smaller hick village of Blasdell, New York, home of my good friend Dave and also a very polite man named Officer McCormick. It was the latter that caught me running a red light and gave me the opportunity to revisit what looks like Colonial Williamsburg, had Colonial Williamsburg been set in 1983.  There were two things I especially noticed during my court appearance. One was the Seal of the Village of Blasdell that hangs ominously over the presiding judge. What looks like an X intersection separates the seal into four unequal sections, which I pointed out to Dave after I gave his town $120. He had never noticed his village's seal before.  "See, on the top section there's the date the village was founded. Then there's a red house, and then a tree. Pretty good, because no other towns have founding dates, houses, or trees."  Dave: "I never noticed that!"  "But the best part is the left-hand side, where they drew a big metal bucket spilling out a bunch of molten steel."  Dave: "Yep, that's Blasdell!"  The other thing one notices in the village court/police dept./fire dept./meeting hall/teen center is the rotary pay phone at the front door. After several attempts to operate the phone using a calling card, the computerized operator said (this, unlike Dave's mutterings above, are a direct quote):  "Let's try this another way. Why don't you SPEAK your card number into the phone instead."  "I still don't understand you. Please speak your card number into the phone, sounding out each number separately."  Boss Hogg and Roscoe P. Coltrane would have been very comfortable here. I felt somewhat embarrassed that I dressed up and wore khakis to the hearing.

      CD: Beck, untitled unreleased upcoming album (beck.com)  Tonight I went to Sam's Club with my father, Jerry, who is now asleep in his underwear on the couch. Every time I go to BJ's Wholesale with Jerry (this is our first time together at Sam's) he gives me the option of driving the shopping cart. I recall that before puberty the notion of getting behind the shopping cart was privilege enough to make me and my siblings fight over the honor, usually running the bottom of the cart into my mother's ankles several times in the process. But after age 12 or so, I would usually find myself at another section of the store, looking for a sale on Parental Avoidance. Since 16, the honor of driving the cart has been paltry compared to driving the motorized cart that got us to the store. Now, years later, I question why my father acts like the mall Santa handing out lollipops when he asks if I want to "take the wheels."  The shopping carts at Sam's are the biggest I've seen outside of Home Depot. However, it is not the size of the carts that I wonder about, but how we use them. At one point my father leaned over to me and said, almost pretending that we were halfway into a conversation, that "all that iced tea is finally making its way so I'm going to find the men's room." In his absence I was to "watch the cart and make sure nothing happens to it." And for the first time I thought to myself, what would happen to it? Would something get stolen? What if something did? It wouldn't matter! It's not like we owned anything in the cart. It's not like we couldn't replace anything if it were taken from the cart. And it's especially not like someone would walk past and think to themselves "Hey, how convenient for me, bwah ha ha! Ten pounds of presently unrefridgerated Sam's Club ground chuck for me to purchase just as if I were in the next aisle where they are currently located! This is my lucky day!  " Nevertheless, I could envision my father coming back from a satisfying journey to The Other Sam's Club, realizing our cart was molested, and yelling, "Noooooooooooo!" In a year's time the Lifetime Movie Network would be rebroadcasting "Where's the Beef: Tragedy at Sam's Club" once every other week.

      CD: Drain STH, "Horror Wrestling"  The other day I saw the movie "Requiem for a Dream," which got me to thinking. That's a good thing! The movie was quality stuff, for one, but the fact that I am able to persue other intellectual pursuits this summer that don't involve schoolwork has really turned on the abstract contemplation juices. I'm even taking time to write a weblog, for gosh sakes! Not that I'm actually smarter, or that this blog is worth reading. But I used to go to a movie theater with friends at the end of a week full of writing and correcting papers, and pretty much just wait until it was over to go home and pee. I can hold it in better now, and I'm talking about the symbolism in the film!  Looking back at the previous paragraph shows that maybe I'm not as intelligent as I think I am this late at night. Anyway, back to movies. Though everyone has their (incorrect) favorites, the greatest movie of all time has to be--you guessed it--Frank Stallone. No, I mean it's "Pee Wee's Big Adventure." I must have seen it 30 times. Think of all the great adventures! The dinosaur! The Alamo! The singing hobo! Mr. T Cereal! Morgan Fairchild! And my favorite part, which I can re-enact for the amusement of my friends:  "On this very night, 10 years ago, along the same stretch of road...in a dense fog...just. like. this...I saw the worst accident I ever seen...There was this sound, like a garbage truck, dropped off the empire state building! And when they finally pulled the driver's body from the twisted, burning, wreck...it looked like... THIS!!!!!!  Hooo hooo hooo hooo hooo haaaah! Yes sir....That was the worst accident...I ever seen."  Even scarier, watch this scene frame by frame to see the extended tongue and the eyes pulled out of their sockets. Sleep tight everybody!

      CD: "Ken Burns' The Civil War: Original Soundtrack Recording"  Mom's birthday last night. After deciding to order Chinese and sit around at home, we all took our time looking at the take out menu we had posted on the fridge and, for once, were able to organize and plan. I was picked to make the call, menu in hand, and--who woulda thunk--no one answered the phone. Tried again. Jiminy. So we settled for Denny's. My parents aren't ones to go to a place with, say, $10/plate dinners. The truck stop and the local diner do it for them. Denny's is a little bit up the snooty list, so going there became a family event. They're alright people, once you get used to them. But my father and I have to stop getting the same things from the menu; this is the third time this has happened in about a week, and I'm starting to think I got a lopsided share of the genes. Anyway, you could tell it was someone's birthday in the family because we went to Denny's and everybody got to have dessert. Fine eatin'. And raspberry iced tea to boot!

      CD: Wipers, various mix CD  Happy Birthday, Sis. Since it's my sister's birthday, and I have nothing else to write about, this topic will be about her. Ask my mother, and she will say my first memory of my sister would be me looking at her from her cradle and saying "That's my sister and I love her." I don't remember that at all. Then again, I was probably two at the time it happened. The first memory I DO have of my sister is when I was about three, and while playing with my blocks realized my sister, brother, and box full of blocks were positioned in a close, perfect line. Ever the boy genious, I thought of dominoes. Now to test the theory! But my brother moved out of the way before I could reconfigure the calculations in my still-developing brain, and the end result was me pushing over my sister for no real reason whatsoever. I got scolded big time for that one. After all, she probably barely knew how to walk by this point. True story. Sadly, worse was done to her by her brothers during the next few years.

      CD: Nirvana, rarities mix (cleaning out my hard drive)  Here's a story I heard from my supervisor at work today. Now remember, my supervisor is about my age, but looks smaller and younger. Anyway, this guy walked into the restaurant the other day, smoking a cigarette. Which is illegal. "I'd like to order x___." "You gonna put that out?" she replies. So he throws it on the floor and stomps it out. "I'd like to order x___." "You gonna pick that up?" she replies.   "No."  "Then I'm not going to serve you."  "You're what?"  "I'm not going to serve you."  "There aren't any ashtrays in here anyway."  "Gee, why do you think that is?"  "So you're not going to serve me?"  "Absolutely not."  So he leaves. But not the building. He finds someone older and asks where the manager is. Somehow he is directed back to the same counter.  "I wanna talk to your manager."  "You're lookin' at 'er."  Silence.  "How about I call up your company and tell them you refuse to serve me?"  "How about I have the state police come over and fine you a thousand dollars for smoking in a public building?"  I guess the guy leaves at this point. But yes, he did call the company the next morning. To which the franchise manager says she wouldn't have served him either. I love happy endings.

      CD: Beatles, "Beatles For Sale"  I often don't do this... Okay, I do this a lot. I'd like to comment on the CD I'm listening to. "Beatles For Sale" reminds me of the Beatles story I heard where the original cover for the album had the band cutting up a bunch of toy dolls. The record company thought it was too risque and had the new covers pasted on the old albums, and if you can find any of those first printings, they're worth a lot of money. But more importantly, the title reminds me of a schoolmate I once had named Sal. Once in what I think was third grade, our class was coming back from a field trip from who knows where (do we ever remember what we did on those field trips? or just who threw up on the bus) when Sal saw a car parked in someone's driveway with the sign "For Sale." "HEY!" he yelled, "FOR SALE! THAT MEANS IT'S FOR ME! FOR SALE!" And I just thought that was the most intellectual pun I'd ever heard. So now, if I see "For Sale" signs anywhere I go, or even the title of this record, I think to myself, "Wow, the Beatles--for Sal!" What a lucky guy that Sal must be  -15 miles on the Erie Canal-

      CD: Beatles, "A Hard Day's Night"  Today I had the pleasure of trying to be a substitute teacher on a Friday, a shortened class schedule, AND Homecoming Day, all rolled up into one. Which, of course, means the kids didn't come to school for any other reason than to put on face paint, eat lunch, and prepare for a full ninety minutes of foot-stomping on the bleachers during the end-of-the-day gym rally. I competely disagree with the idea that children have a short attention span, because if you saw how much time and care they spent in applying glitter....Anyway, it was a lucky coincidence that the day I decide to wear a red shirt is the day I'm called in to a school whose colors are red, whose mascot is an Indian chief, and who practically made crimson clothes a one-day law for students and faculty. Go Chiefs, dude. Go Chiefs.

      CD: Ani DiFranco, various mix CD (3 of 4)  Sitting here in the school library (I have been here about eight hours now) has helped me invent a new game. It's called Name That Ringtone. That's right, folks! A brand new, reality-based game show (two television fads in one!) that pits the one half of conscientious, minding-my-own-business, trying-to-finish-a-paper students against the other half of "Hey-baby-wussup," "Okay-I'll-meet-you-in-the-computer-lab," "DON'T CALL ME NOW, I'M IN THE LIBRARY!" students. The game is easy. Listen to all the different cell phones going off (phones-to-minute ratio: 1:4), and try to guess 1) What song is incessantly blurting out of it 2) Where that noise is coming from, anyway 3) Will someone please answer it?! before losing your cool. Remember, cell phones are not allowed in the library facilities. But don't lose your cool, or you lose the game! Brought to you by these fine sponsors:  Centrum Silver Wonder Bread Panasonic Carnival Cruise Lines Pontiac  with special promotional consideration by  Milton Bradley  guests receive accomodations at the fine  Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills  "Name That Ringtone" is produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises and filmed in front of a live television audience in Television City, California.

      CD: Ani Difranco, various mix (CD 1 of 4)  Today I went from 0 to Sick as Hell in two hours. This is messed up. One minute you're up and ready to face the day, the next you've got water pouring like an open faucet out your nose. I seriously wonder where all this water comes from. Is it from the blood? In that case my blood must be extremely thick right now. It FEELS like the water came from my brain, which makes a lot of sense--my brain being a watertower and all, I mean. That would have explained the high pressure in which the water left my nose when I sneezed. (And did I ever.) I have easily gone through thirty Kleenex or Kleenex substitutes, such as toilet paper, paper towels, the backs of my fingers (in emergencies, and there were a few of those) and who knows what next.   The saddest part of all is that I went through all this while substituting a class. I lucked out because the missing guy has a student teacher, and that guy did all the work (not getting paid) while I sat in the back trying to prevent the snot dike from breaking (while getting paid). I am warm and I am tired. Good thing I also have class today, or I wouldn't have had a reason to get up this morning! Ugh.

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat" (Rocks!)  "You," if that is your real name, probably knows by now that I buy a lot of records. What to do if four great records come out on the same day but you only have enough money for two? Believe it or not this has happened to me before. Have you ever noticed that payday is always a day or two away from the time that you actually need the cash? Well, after mulling different travel plans ("Okay, I'll go to the bank on Tuesday, then the store on the way to class, and on Wednesday...") that would enable me to reallocate resources adequately--something the Soviets could have done if they implemented worker incentives right off the bat--I realized, Hey, I have a Credit Card! Click click click, done on the internet in two minutes. No gas money, bank hours or spare change needed! Why didn't you guys tell me about this before! It sure beats hiding a couple grand under my mattress....

      CD: Tenacious D, "Tenacious D"  Guess what! I'm named after my grandmother! I finally asked my mother why my name is "Fred." On her side of the family, she had a grandfather named Fred that died right before her and my father were married. She also has a brother named Fred. BUT, and this was the point she emphasized TWICE in the conversation, her mother's nickname is "Fred" as well. Yes. Grandma's real name is Catherine (coincidentally, my sister's middle name) but those her age apparently call her Fred as a gesture of compassion and friendly jesting. Let me reiterate: I have a Grandma Fred. The genes are strong enough to perpetuate the family line. Aren't you worried about this? Do you understand the implications? These people are breeding!!

      CD: Beatles, "Yellow Submarine"  So I was making chocolate chip cookies at work today. Sue me, I'm in food service! Anyway, two of the chocolate chip cookies fused together in the oven, creating an uber-cookie of mass proportions and comparable, in political terms, to the NATO-Russia alliance. Can't sell it, but dang, why put it to waste? It was an hour before my break....OH, by the way, you should know first is that I work 10-hour shifts, and don't eat lunch. Therefore, the prospect of chocolate chip cookies is more than mouth-watering, but mind-blowing. It's like an inspiration; a muse; a raison d'etre for the rest of the work period....ANYWAY! I was looking for the perfect moment to sneak the uber-cookie into my packback (I brought homework, but never did any of it).   Enter Ted, the 81-year-old dishwasher. I was gone for FIVE SECONDS. I come back, there's no uber-cookie, he's chewing on something! Big mouthful, can't even talk, hiding his face in the corner. That bastard took my cookie! My hideously malformed, illicit uber-cookie! @%#^*@! I was really, Really hungry and it was gone! Man. You don't know how much that hurt. Like taking candy from a baby. And for him, it probably was. Schwag.

      CD: John Lennon, "Live In New York City"  I keep strange things, and put them in strange places. No, not there! Let me explain my ambiguous statement. Today I was driving to the gas station (an irony in itself) when I spotted tons 'o stuff being thrown out at one guy's house. I think it used to be the house of Harold, the nice and really old guy that used to be a janitor at my grade school. He must be long passed or moved by now. He was at Pearl Harbor, you know. "Weeee KNEW they were comin'!" he'd say.   What was I talking about? Oh, so a piece of refuse caught my eye. It's one of those carpeting sample things, 4 samples by 7, and each rectangular sample the size of an index card. Where some would pass by without thinking, I glanced at it and decided the sampler was a lovely piece of post-modernist art. I mean, you got your fabric, you got a progression of ever lighter hues, and you got an emotionless, manufactured arrangement that says "Warhol" all over it. You should see the other crap I have in my room.   And stop comparing me to Christopher Lowell!

      CD: Oasis, "Be Here Now"  Oftentimes I will listen to music and just not "get it." I can read pages and pages of press about a band and think yes, I WILL risk fifteen dollars on this one ($15! Thank goodness for KaZaa, lucky broadband people!) listen to it once--usually while reading a newspaper or writing this bloody thing--and think "eh." This happened with my Sleater-Kinney album about two days ago. But then, at some future date I will put it in my car and the moon will be in just the right place and suddenly I will achieve musical oneness with the songs. I will feel the minute nuances in the vocals and the rhythm and melody and I will say to myself "This is genious. So THIS is how you're supposed to listen to it. They were right!" In a metaphorical sense, what I think I'm trying to say is that gardens are nice, but flowers in the desert are nicer. Is that understandable? I hope so. Thanks for the indulgence.

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "Axis: Bold As Love"  It's regrettable that we live in a society where women cannot walk alone in public places. Then again, at least they can be in public places, unlike Iran, and at least they can walk, unlike pre-colonial China. Still, one out of every five women in America are victims of sexual assault. So while I was going to start off this post by saying "Why are people so paranoid?" I've rationalized a bit more. Here's the problem, however. I'm a very fast walker, and it has made me look like a ravenous predator. At places like the college campus or anywhere with a sidewalk, it seems, I have somewhere to go while the women walking half a block in front of me apparently do not. This means that at some point I will pass them. Now sure, they might hear footsteps coming behind them, but it's even more possible that women have a sixth sense that a lone young male is coming up behind them, even from forty yards. (Maybe they have eyes in the back of their head, just like mom!) I instantly become a threat. You will observe the quick "I'm turning my head slightly but I'm not looking back and I'll pretend like I'm going along my business without looking worried about you" glance. As you come closer--staying as close as possible to the exact opposite side of the sidewalk so as not to look like you want to engage her--a minority percentage will tersely change their direction. Most just keep pretending like they don't notice me, which is the best thing, but the least amount of people consider slowing down and actually letting me pass them. What the heck, am I really that creepy?  Don't think it only happens between sexes, either. I was walking down Bleeker Street one Saturday night in NYC when, after several blocks, I was coming closer to a man going in my direction. He eventually started walking faster, and then quickly crossed the street. Mind you, I was still about half a block away. We walked parallel until I passed him about five blocks later. Ironically, I was suffering from an inflamed knee joint at the time and was trying Very Hard not to look injured and get assaulted myself; the only reason I was walking fast that night (I had nowhere to go) was that it hurt too much to stay on one leg for too long. If the guy had actually started chasing after me, I wouldn't have been able to run. So in conclusion, if a guy's walking up from behind you ON A BRIGHTLY LIT STREET, IN FULL VIEW OF DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE, LET THEM PASS YOU. We just want you to move out of the way; we're late for class dammit! Thank you!

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "Are You Experienced?"  It happens to you every couple of years. You have one in your closet right now. In fact, you wore it just a couple of days ago. The Pants With the Loose Zipper. We all have one. The kind of pants where you're walking down the sidewalk and then realize "it's time to check." The pants whose zipper refuses to stay up. Were they made wrong? Maybe you could get a safety pin and... No. That just wouldn't be right. Anyway, what if I accidentally pricked my... Yeah. Why do they do that? And why is it I always forget THESE are those pants until it's almost too late, right before I'm about to walk into a room full of people, or as I'm talking to someone while standing up? It never fails. No, wait, it ALWAYS fails. And I really like these pants, too.

      CD: Alice In Chains, "MTV Unplugged"  I realize now that it takes one hour to get here--my college--and then one hour to get back from my two hour class. I am not amused. Granted, I save thousands by not finding an apartment in the city, and even another $100 or so by parking across the street, about two blocks from my classroom. Why do I mention this today, and not three weeks ago when classes started? Because--and this is the saddest part of all--I had a paper due today, so I procrastinated for a week until I finally sat down and wrote it, then on the way to school remember it takes a WHILE to get there and ended up ten minutes late. And I can't blame traffic or weather or accidents or a poorly running car or horrible road conditions or a parking problem or the police or the suspected terrorists from Lackawanna or my mother or President Bush or even Frank Stallone. And THEN, to make up for my lateness, I had to force myself to participate in class to look like I hadn't missed anything and really cared about the discussion at hand! I almost NEVER participate in class because it bothers me so! Cursed space-time continuum, forcing me to find witty comments and universally accepted syntax and diction to spew forth like dandelion seeds towards a group of people I would hardly recognize on the street! Curses, me!

      09 16 02   CD: Patti Smith, "Gung Ho"  My table is cluttered with unfinished business. From the far left to the far right: 1.) The book I have to finish reading for class next week. I'm about 20% done. 2.) Education loan forms that must be compared to my old tax files. Descrepancies must be forwarded to the bank for re-examination. 3.) The bill from grad school. I'm expecting a check, which help pay for #2. 4.) Four CDs that must be copied by the 19th, before they're due back at the library. 5.) CDs I actually bought, that must be entered into my database with the CDs I'm about to burn. 6.) The crate of copied worksheets that should be organized chronologically for use in a school setting. You know, for that job you want to get? 7.) Reciepts and work slips that must be put into appropriate folders. 8.) AOL E-mail printout, which must be saved in case they bill me $23 for an account I never bought (and they said they would fix). 9.) Blank videotapes. I'll use one tonight but these should be put somewhere else. 10.) Newspaper clips that require a typed-out summary for a class, due Wednesday. 11.) An ad for the new Danko Jones album. Just finished writing an E-mail asking for free tickets. 12.) CDs that must be put back in their cases from their rotation in my car. 13.) That reminds me, look up the costs/benefits of trading in my 2001 car for a 2003 that has a no-interest payment plan. Dude, I better do that one now.

      CD: R.E.M., "New Adventures In Hi-Fi"  Dangit. I wore pants tonight. I want some more shorts weather so I don't have to deal with full coverings. Sooner than you know it I'll have to wear a long-sleeved shirt, too. Ugh. And in my free time! There's always that one momentous day in, oh, late October where you transmogrify from a summer wanna-be shorts-wearer to a temporarily permanent, leaf-rakin' pants guy. Think about it. You can never pinpoint the date, but in hindsight you think back on it and realize Hey, we don't live in the Arctic Circle, but there are 6 months of pants and 6 months of shorts, and now everything is dark again. Time for 5 PM sunsets, examining the walls of your house for egg and shaving cream remnants, and the manditory "AAA says more people will be traveling during Thanksgiving than any other time of the year" reports on the local news. Must...fight...power....Must...take off...pants...

      CD: PuffyAmiYumi, "An Illustrated History"  Not that I want to make Buffalo State a home away from home, but it's getting there for me. I joined the radio station club, and have to go through "training." So far so good, especially when training gives me the time to read the newspaper and the liner notes to CDs I don't own. Yet. Bwah ha ha. After noticing I actually had some of the CDs in their rotation in my own collection, I started feeling more like a musical genious and went shopping for some more of the stuff. After picking up the CD I'm listening too right now, the alt/college clerk asked me "are you ready for the invasion?" "You mean, the invasion of..." "PuffyAmiYumi," we said in unison. So today is a first; I had a conversation with a record store clerk about Japanese pop music. And I actually new more than he did. I'm in. I am SO in now.  By the way, in my opinion I'm sticking with the Pizzicato Five. Puffy is too synth for me, and I prefer the retro lounge feel I get from Nomiya Maki's vocals and the richer instrumentation in P5 releases. Now that Bis is playing in my stereo, I'm having a bit more fun. If I had heard Puffy before I heard Pizzicato, I'd probably be enamored with both bands by now. Odd equation:  Bis + Pizzicato Five + Natalie Imbruglia = PuffyAmiYumi  Now go listen to your Puddle of Mudd album.

      CD: Oasis, "Be Here Now"  Last night I was two seconds from impulse buying Jaffa blocks at Tops; 2 for $5. That's a good deal! They're the ones that you can either use as milk crates--like for my records, which I could really use--or for hanging files--I could really use that, too, for all of the teaching supplies I've stolen over the years--there are too many dashes in this sentence. Nevertheless, I just came back from The Mall, where I suddenly thought "I should buy some posters, because the only interesting thing in my room is the paint falling off the ceiling." I walked into that hippie place and found two pretty good ones, 2 for $12. That's a good deal! One was a Sistene Chapel close-up of God's and Adam's fingers; the other was a Radiohead poster of the U.S. blowing up, or something eerie like that. But I chickened out again. I don't buy gum, candy bars, bottled water, or anything else from the checkout line. I don't supersize my value meals because I pack peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I only read free newspapers, or take the ones already paid for from lounge room tables. I'm a lousy, incompetent capitalist. Sorry.

      CD: Led Zeppelin, "BBC Sessions"  Nobody's noticed, but I'm getting fatter. I know because I have a really mooshy tummy when I sit, in medical terms. I only used to have a smaller, moderately mooshy tummy, but now sometimes it's bigger, but softer. My lack of nutritional or health knowledge tells me that all that water will eventually solidify into fat. On a more scientific note, I also know I am getting fatter by my boxer shorts. Where they used to only ride part way, now they ride waaaaaay up. Luckily my fat self still wears shorts, so I can reach up in there when behind my car or in an empty hallway. Not that I did that today. By the way, when I mean "fat" this means about three pounds, (measured my friend Joe's grandmother's bathroom scale) now putting me at the average weight for my size. Still, the water is hardening; who knows what the future might bring? Thank goodness for new McDonald's low-fat cooking oil. [TM]

      CD: Money Mark, "Push the Button"  Tonight (actually "last night" because I'm writing this on September 10th) I was driving to the magical Truck Stop to meet my parents for dinner when I spotted quite a large fire burning in an empty field. It looked pretty cool. Then I thought about how it was strange nobody was watching the fire, especially when the house not too far from it seemed to be empty. Usually in this rural town you will see the smoke from controlled field fires, or illegal backyard burnings. Being uneducated in agriculture, I figured they were doing it to enrich the soil, and they were doing it in the dark so they could catch any stray sparks before they flamed up. Or something like that. Either way I didn't give it much more consideration. Then, driving my father back on the way home (my mother left early to watch "Emeril Live!" on the Food Network [?]) I asked him, "hey, did you see the fire on the way here?" Just as it came out of my mouth, we saw smoke, we saw fire trucks, we had to take a detour around a hill. Chances are, lightning caused the brush fire, and the whole field was ablaze. Had I known then what I knew now, I probably would have done something, even though it probably would have ended up happening anyway. And somehow, I think this sums up how everyone has looked back at the past year.

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Reel Time Sessions" [disc II]  The original idea behind starting a weblog was so that I could work on writing, especially about myself, for job applications, school papers, and the like. And while I have written much more than I would have under the cirumstances (nearing seventy entries, each at least a half-page of text in an ordinary word processing program), it now gives me yet another excuse to avoid doing the very thing it intended to improve! As of this writing I have just finished a two-page paper that took me two hours; it should have taken me 45 minutes. After every half page of text--exactly one paragraph in the paper, coincidentally--I got mental block. Like right now. And coincidentally again, I am at one-half page of text.  Worst of all, no one is ever going to see that paper. It was optional, and I wanted to get some "practice" in before class discussion. Beyond that, even I may never see it again, because it costs ten cents per page to print in this bloody library. Man, funk dat!

      CD: New Kids On The Block, "Hangin' Tough"  Recently my former roommate Dave commented to me that recently he has not been able to "notice my distinctive scent" anymore. Though I have tried a number of subtle tactics to reduce my alleged odor, including perioding bathing, the washing of clothes, and even a diet including moderate to large amounts of liquids, I must also think that Dave's olfactory keenness was fine-tuned over time to notice my scent while I was living with him. Why, just recently I was doing homework when I simply stopped and looked up. Something was just not right, and I could not pinpoint it for several minutes. Then I realized: I could hear myself think. After four years of being a collegiate resident, living with at least three other people and their varied eating/sleeping/blaring music times, unplanned nights out, and impromptu wrestling matches, I can now read a book without interruption. Which means I can't. Every few pages I have to go get a drink of water, put on a CD or--stranger yet--read another book. Dorm life has destroyed my sense of continuity.

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Reel Time Sessions"  Sometimes a person can do something that will make them smile. Smiling seems awfully goofy and awkward when you're by yourself, however. I once saw a show that asked the viewers if they've every really laughed when they were alone; no contact with the human race like television, radio, books, or people-watching in the mall is allowed. The man may be on to something. Nevertheless, I'm smiling because I got into my father's room (usually locked), installed the microphone to his computer, and made brand new sounds to temporarily replace the normal AOL defaults. Instead of "Welcome" I now ask him personally, "Hey, what's goin' on?" Instead of "Goodbye" when the phone line cuts him off, he hears me say "Hey, I'm trying to use the phone!" which is usually what he hears from the phone anyway. But my favorite is the famous "You've Got Mail", now my impersonation of the now-popular skit from "Crank Yankers" starring Special Ed. If you've never heard it, download it from Kazaa. My father is going to give me a piece of his mind this time tomorrow, but I'll be smiling then, too. Hey, at least his microphone's installed.

      CD: Remy Zero, "The Golden Hum"  Yesterday I came into the house to find the cat eating last night's casserole. Apparently no one fed the cat, or the cat was still hungry. Either way, the casserole from last night was left out uncovered for the cat to feast upon. I should have thrown it out right there, but after shooing the cat I put the rest on top of the fridge with the sign "Cat was eating the casserole."   My mother, who likes to keep a bucket of compost in the kitchen just a little to long as habit, responded. "Well I'm still going to eat it, I'm hungry!"  Today I came home and looked in the fridge. Day-old tomato soup. Browning salad. Hot dogs hardened by exposure to air. And a spider, sentry keeping watch over the Tomb of the Unknown Leftovers. I wasn't going to eat that crap anyway, but tonight I'm going to take a stand for sanitation. Something tells me I'm going to be much hungrier by the end of the week, or at least a much more efficient, single-serving cook.

That means I can play my old Nintendo games on the computer! Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3! Mega Man 3 with the really cool music (okay, the music sucks today). Tecmo Super Bowl, with Bruce Smith! Ninja Gaiden, The Legend of Zelda, and Tetris! Tetris, everybody! I know somebody's reading this. TETRIS!  Contra and the Konami Code! Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, B, A, select, start! All of Middle School is flashing before my eyes and yes, by "all" I mean my ENTIRE middle school life! Stop laughing!

      CD: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass (anniversary reissue)"  My sister recently broke up with someone. She told me very little about the actual person, but did tell me a lot about his parents' pet lion. As I remember hearing it, a long time ago (before this person was born or not I don't recall) the father got the family a pet lion, and kept it in the backyard with a very high fence. The police, not wanting to have to deal with future lion problems, would actually come on the property and taunt it, trying to make it do something illegal so they could have it taken out of town. In retaliation, the father installed spike strips on the driveway whenever the family went out Eventually the trap worked: the police drove in to taunt the lion again, their tires busted, they called for backup but the backup got their tires busted too, the family came home and the father says "Hey, what are you guys up to?! You were going to taunt my lion again!"   It sounds like Aesop should attach a moral to this one. "Don't tap the glass" or "Make sure you have a warrant" or something.

      CD: Steve Fisk, "999 Levels of Undo"  Canadian money has gotten really messed up lately. I don't know if it's the bad exchange rate, or the new dollar redesigns in the U.S. that are making them jealous, or the fact that they ran out of all their old change while using American vending machines, but Canadians have tried a lot of tripped out changes. The first one was the dollar coin, which is a good, rational idea, but then they thought about the TWO dollar coin, which really looks like a little coin melded with a big fat donut of a coin around the outside. Then they thought "Hey, why don't we add a shiny hologram looking thing at the corner of this bill" and "Hey, what if we use twelve colors on this bill" and "Hey, while we're at it, let's use this picture of my kids playing hockey in the backyard and put that on there too, and here's this poem about World War II that I like, we can fit it in somewhere." Even stranger, if you look at the back of some of the newer quarters you can find moose, spacemen, stick drawings of people, and Thor knows what else. In conclusion, since the NHL started migrating south Canadians have basically lost the will to live. Their search for new hobbies has come up dry (it's not like they have anything to clean up there) and this is the result. Sad, I know, but it keeps them occupied. But I fear for their stamps.

      My college is quite diverse in terms of age demographics. Today we "introduced" ourselves to the class, where we have your forty year olds, your twenty year olds, your sixty year olds, your parents (not YOUR parents, but people with kids, in fact one guys wife was going into the hospital tonight for induced labor) and your people that came in thinking it was the economics class next door. The first person to introduce himself was a guy who, instead of just giving his name and occupation like the rest of society expects of him, spoke for ten minutes about how he came from Senegal and then moved to China for a year with a scholarship, had to learn engineering in Chinese AND Chinese at the same time, then excelled in his grades so greatly that he was able to get another scholarship to learn English and then come to the United States. And had he spoken last, we would have been very proud of him. Instead we all gave each other glances as if to say "I hope I'm not going next." "I have nothing to say. This guy won." "Shut up already, we're impressed, leave us alone." "This is only supposed to take a minute; I have to go soon, I have a baby on the way dammit!" We hope he doesn't talk again for the rest of the semester.

      CD: Collective Soul, "Disciplined Breakdown"  Natalie Imbruglia saved my life last night. And this morning. After a long day that started after a four-hour-night's sleep, I found myself driving home at 5 in the morning so I could go to sleep for another 90 minutes. Ms. Imbruglia could be depended on for her soothing yet introspective song stylings that not only kept my attention, but got me to sing along to her catchy refrains at the top of my voice, keeping me awake and alert as well. It does not have to be mentioned that I was alone and my car windows were closed shut during this exercise. And this morning, after said ninety-minute-night's sleep, when I had to drive another forty miles to take my sister to work, and my eyes were 80% shut during the entire drive, the album "White Lilies Island again deliverd vibrant pop soundscapes for me to croon too as I feigned consciousness. Because of the dozens of times I have found myself listening to a certain musical genre this summer that would normally reduce me to nausea, I declare this the Summer of Natalie Imbruglia. Sorry, Nelly, but it's too hot in herre for you!

      CD: Bruce Springsteen, "The Rising"  Mad shout-outs tonight. First, shout outs to the gas pumpers at the Totem Pole for doing their job, rain or shine, snowstorm or heatwave every day. Second, mad props to the school secretaries for keeping it real with politeness and sincerity even in the midst of the jungle. Third to my peeps on the Thruway, the toll-takers, construction workers, travel plaza associates, and miscellaneous that keep everybody moving. Fourth, everybody at the IHOP on Maple (what a coincidence, the names are!) for their high standards of quality and wide selection. And last but best of all, everyone at the many Blockbuster locations in Buffalo for their mad crazy phone tree system. We found the perfect movie at 12:30 in the morning, and couldn't have done it without the support of my B-Buster peeps on Delaware. Everybody watch "Fear of a Black Hat"!

      CD: Vines, "Get Free" promo  I did it! I wrote Subway an E-mail. Actually it was a Customer Service form I found on their website, but I still did it! I had to provide a whole bunch of information about where I lived, the address of the Subway I went to, blah blah blah, but I still did it! Woo! Here's my letter:   You guys are great! I would eat your subs three times a day if I could. Seriously! I had the Chicken Teriyaki today and the Italian B.M.T. the day before. They really hit the spot! I'm going to try some of the other sandwiches to see which one I like the best. The best thing about your subs is that they're big but they're fresh and light, so I can enjoy a foot-long but not feel too full afterwards. Friendly help, too! Keep up the good work!  P.S. The cookies are good, too!   I heart Subway!

      CD: Radiohead, "Pinkpop 2001" live bootleg  I ate at Subway again, and I'm telling you guys that place is GREAT. Sure, I can't think of another topic to write about today, but seriously. Subway makes great sandwiches. I've found myself staring at the writing on their paper cups a lot; you know, the ones with the charts saying how much healthier Subway subs are to Big Macs and Whoppers. This is true. Don't forget, however, that their chart doesn't figure in cheese or mayonnaise, or any other special stuff. And I eat foot-longs, not the 6-inchers. So really it's twice the calories, but that's just a tangent. If you're ever hungry and you need something fast, go get a Subway sub. The lettuce is fresh, they'll make 'em any way you want 'em, there's a Subway on every other block, the prices are decent, the people are friendly, there usually aren't a lot of people there, it's open pretty late at night, and, oh, I don't know, they're just really really really really GOOD! I mean it you guys, eat there! You think I'm kidding around! I think tomorrow I'm going to write them a letter.

      CD: Robert Bradley's Backwater Surprise, "Live"  Oh man oh man oh man, I went to Subway the other day and had yet another AWESOME Subway Sandwich. That place is so cool! How many times do you walk around thinking, "Man, I wish I was eating a sub right now"? Well, for me it's a lot! I parked my car, put a quarter in the meter, and six minutes later (I checked the meter when I came back) I had a 12-inch sub in my hands! Bonus! Only in America...'cuz in Canada they probably call them 30-centimeter subs or something. ANYWAY, from now on I will use my time at Subway to experiment and find the best fixin's for My Perfect Subway Sub. Today: the Italian sub with honey mustard sauce and cheese, on parmesean bread. (Did I spell "parmesean" right? I don't think I did.) Next time I'll try it without the pickles. Rock over London, rock on Chicago...Subway: Eat Fresh!

      CD: Supergrass, "Supergrass"  Umm...my day in a nutshell.  1:30 AM: Wake up from my three hours of sleep. Quick, take a shower, get a bunch of records, and drive 45 minutes to Buffalo State.  3:00 AM: Radio show. It went pretty well this time, though I had to get let in the building by a police officer this time because everyone else had gone home. To do what?  6:00 AM: End radio show. Found a couple of CDs lying on the floor that I figured I'd keep for my lonesome. The Vines promo, for one. Sweet. Also played a Wesley Willis station ID that he recorded when he was staying in the residence halls for a week or so last year. That guy can really rock and roll. Now it's time for work!  6:45 AM: Finish driving from Buffalo to Elma, New York to the school there. Change my shirt in the empty parking lot. I arrive early enough that I can set up things and still have time to start a paper I have due next week Wednesday.  7:30 AM: Start work. Easy day today, just playing the same movie for a bunch of classes. You can start to predict what the students' reactions will be to certain parts: when they will laugh, when they will all say "Ew!" at the sight of blood, and even when they will start and stop paying attention. Interesting.  2:30 PM: Finish work, kind of. During my free periods I finish that homework paper, which is probably the earliest I've ever done anything for a class. I'm almost an example to my students or something. Now it's time for Bus Duty, meaning I stand around in the cold making sure no one gets run over in the parking lot.  3:00 PM: Drive back to Buffalo.  3:30 PM: Lunch in Buffalo, at Subway! Subway rocks! I even had a discount card that gave me a free sub! Yeah!  4:00 PM: I have two hours until my next class. I go to the library and find out I owe $10 in late fines (@*$#*^$!!) and read three newspapers. I'm hukd on fonix.  6:00 PM: Presentations in class. It's a good class, especially since I'm not presenting today. I make some comment about an episode of Antiques Road Show that actually isn't too embarrassing. Maybe I should participate more.  8:00 PM: Back to the library. Talking to you.  10:30 PM: Back home? Should probably eat something. Maybe call Dave. Dave doesn't read this weblog, so I can call him a monkey boy without him knowing.  12:00 AM: Zzz? Probably not...

      CD: Queens Of The Stone Age, "Songs For The Deaf" [It's good!]  Since first grade I have dreaded Fruit Cups. My secondary complaint is that the assorted fruit ones have way too much pineapple, and I can't stand pineapple. Why do they put it on hams? My primary complaint, however, has to do with the packaging; those little lift-up metal things on the top of the cans. I used to think that either I was Superman or the lid and the can were fused together or the opener part was just the weakest thing known to man. Four times out of ten I would rip that little lift-up little thing right off the top. Then I would be stuck with a completely unopened can, or one only opened part-way with just a tiny bit of assorted fruit juice coming out of the side. Mastery of fork maneuvering would be paramount in these occations.   Today at work, a similar situation brought my mind back to those days. I was trying to open a can of kidney beans with the same type of lid as the fruit cups. Maybe I have grown stronger since first grade. Maybe the lift-up things have become weaker. I ruined three consecutive cans without popping them open. In frustration, I thought "ah forget it," and so I took a pair of scissors (because we didn't have a can opener; what the heck?) and just stabbed the thing. Woosh. Kidney juice everywhere. Dripping from the wall, from the ceiling, from my hat, from the other wall. No fingerpaints for me that day.

      CD: Weezer, "Weezer" [Green Album]  My new favorite television channel must be NewsWorld International. Since it's not American, I get to hear about things that don't involve the words "sniper," "Osama," or "Tom Daschle". Also, the station is run by the CBC, meaning they interview people one at a time, instead of having them shout at each other via live satellite feed. But the best part? They also play news from Mexico, Japan, China, Russia, and Germany. My favorite one is Germany. Not only do they speak perfect English on the German show (even better than the danged English) they also report on the French. They're nice to the French, but why do the bread eaters always make themselves look bad? It seems the French are either on strike, hogging farm subsidies, pretending to be a superpower, talking like they're drunk, or making little to no contribution to the cultural capital of the industrialized world. Actually I'm kidding. But that last one there? I just read it in my history textbook. Yes; for Grad School. Zut alors!

It almost sounds like a full day when you type it out. I've also spent an inordinate amount of time trying to pry a piece of beef out from between my teeth with my tongue. Using suction hasn't worked, either, so I may just have to go in with the brush. Sometimes I wonder whether I should just ban certain foods from my diet because they always get stuck in my teeth. Apples, for example. Also some chicken, but not all. And corn; I forgot to mention corn on the cob. Nasty on the chompers.

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, "Rufus Wainwright"  Aw, Jiminy. My social life has just decreased tenfold. Here at the college library computer lab we used to be able to download Instant Messenger every time we used it. It was annoying, but hey, it's still better than dial-up. So I would talk to people here at will because I PAID FOR THIS CONNECTION GOSH DARN IT. Somehow, the lovely and talented people at the BS ITS have learned how to block the little button on the AOL.com page that would download the IM program, make me happy, and give me a reason (one out of, oh, three) to stay on campus after class. (The other two reasons, by the way, are Drinking and Petty Theft). So screw you guys, I'm a going home.

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island" [Yeah!]  The city of Buffalo actually decided to have autumn this year, meaning no snow but cold weather. Last year we had summer until Christmas, then got eight feet of snow in two days, then had spring, which was really just the five months it took to melt the eight feet of snow. But either way it's time to put the fans away and turn on the heater. (Assuming you have a heater; it seems a large number of people in Buffalo do not.) Our heater prevents me from getting a cold by taking all the of the dust it's collected over the spring and summer and, using the a new technology called fire, makes the dust hot and circulates it throughout the building and into my nose. Therefore I have cold symptoms, not because I am sick, but because the heater is making me sneeze. Does that make sense? Basically, I have invented a cold vaccine.

      CD: Beck, "Mixed Bizness" single  Now that I'm a commuter, there are things about college that I appreciate more than I used to. One is ample eating establishments. I am overjoyed that I am a stone's throw away from a Subway franchise, and that there's a Mighty Taco right across the street. Another is long, once-a-week night classes. You actually have time to go to them, and you only have to make the drive once. Which brings me to the things I don't appreciate. Like, when you drive 45 minutes to a class that ends up showing a video. Or when you go just to take a 20 minute, multiple-choice test. Or when you want to use a computer in the library lab but there isn't one available. For three hours. Did I mention there's a Subway? Subway sandwiches are the bomb.  What was I talking about again?

      CD: Liz Phair, "Whitechocolatespaceegg"  News just can't get any funnier. Did you hear this one? Saddam Hussein holds an election, where he runs unopposed. No, that's not the punchline. THEN, he wins! That's not the punchline, either! Okay, THEN, because he is apparently so thankful to the citizens of Iraq for loving him SO MUCH that they give him 100% of the vote, he decides to free almost every prisoner in the country. That's right, he empties all of the jails. So I got to thinking, what do prisoners--mostly young males with a penchant for violence--do once they get out of prison? Well, maybe they can do something for Saddam Hussein, you know, as kind of a "thank you" for letting them out early. But what would Saddam need with violent, fanatically supportive males aged 18-35? Especially with this upcoming war with the United States...where will he find the time to figure this out?

      10 20 98   CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  Yesterday I worked a twelve-hour shift. I did it because they asked me to. I could have declined, and in a lot of ways I wanted to, but for whatever reason I always take on more work than I originally intend on. And then I end up doing even more than that. And I guess I end up enjoying it. I think I worked about 45 hours at three jobs this week, not including two days of classes and their homework, and not considering the 45 minutes of drive time between all of those places. Why do I like it? I get to listen to my car stereo, I meet new people, I get out of the house...all of those dumb excuses and more. Oh, and someday next week I'll get three paychecks in the mail. That makes me forget just how tired I am.   g1410/20

      CD: various, "Hype!" soundtrack  Awwww! It was so cute! I basically had nothing to do yesterday, so somehow I ended up at a CD store. That really has nothing to do with this story. But as I was driving back from the CD store, I took a few back roads because on the way to the CD store there was a lot of construction, you know, one-lane with a guy waving people through kind of stuff, and it was rush hour so I wasn't even going to try it. That has nothing to do with the story either. So as I was driving back, I saw these three little lumps walking around on the road. As most animals do, they are supposed to run across the street or out of the way, or at least pause, stare at you for a second, and then freak out. But these little lumps just sat down. They were to small to figure out what they were before I got to them--I thought they might have been retarded squirrels--but when I came to a complete stop from 62 miles per hour I realized they were two-week-old kittens trying to get warm on the pavement. Aww. Awwwwwww! So I watched as they looked around for a while and then figured out that they should get out of the way. I think the grey one was even asleep! Awwwww!

      CD: Ani DiFranco, "Swing Set EP"  I started playing Nintendo again, so any free time I thought I had two days ago has suddenly disappeared, as well as that tiny modicum of desire I possessed that told me tonight I would get that History paper done for Monday. Well, well, well. Whose fault is this? Not mine, of course. Mario has a new game out. The last time a new Mario game came out that I could play was Mario 64, which was totally sweet, and though I hadn't touched video games for about two years before that I lost my Thanksgiving vacation getting all 120 stars in that game. And here we go again. When I downloaded an NES emulator this summer I went into hiding for about a week while I tried to relearn Ninja Gaiden, so who knows how long this will last. By the way, if you look at the cover of Ninja Gaiden, doesn't it look like the Japanese symbols say "The"? I was at a store (Brand Names) buying a video game when I was 12 (Adventures of Lolo) and the guy kept telling the clerk he wanted "Ninja The Gaiden" and she couldn't find it on the shelf for the life of her. Adventures of Lolo was $19.99 and the only game we could afford without waiting another week to get a better one. One more addiction...

      CD: Radiohead, "Amnesiac"  I have spent the last twenty-four hours typing. Papers, E-mails, IM conversations, message board posts. I when I wasn't typing I was writing what I would type the next time I got to a computer. Somehow, between (a little) sleep, work, school, and about an hour and a half of driving time, I have typewritten about thirty-five pages of text. That's an estimate, really. Some were double-spaced, single-spaced...a lot was erased and rewritten. I must have used...six computers today? It sounds about right. Last year I found I have become dependent on a computer; this year I discovered that it must be strapped to my body in order to survive. I'm looking into laptops, but I'll probably chicken out because of the money. Even though I've oogled the specs online for several wasted hours in the past few weeks. Heck, today I spent so much time on computers that I actually crashed a Mac. A Mac! I thought that was impossible. Except for that one time when I was twelve and exploring a computer the first time. I don't know how I did it, but I started rewriting the boot data. Luckily we were both saved by a conscientious technology teacher. But that's a different story. I have to go now, as the amount of time I spend on a computer in one day is the direct adverse of the amount of food I eat. In other words, the last time was yesterday afternoon.

      CD: Radiohead, "Kid A"  Here's my day in a nutshell. This was posted at another topic out of necessity, but since I wrote it twice, I should post it twice...    Frederick Schrock 16 October 2002 SSE 540 Journal Article Dr. Fusco  Education, Summer 2002 v122 i4 p674(6)   The Technology Hub: a cost effective and educationally sound method for the integration of technology into schools. Joseph S.C. Simplicio.   This article introduces an idea which should be more of a reality in grade schools: the technology "hub", a center at the school where information can be accessed and transferred by anyone involved with the school, whether inside of it or out. Many schools already have some form of a hub installed or planned; numerous schools have practically replaced their libraries with "media centers" where computers take the place that rows of books once held.  There are many benefits to the technology hub. The author mentions that teachers can write tests onlin for students to access later, possibly in a resource room setting. Parents can go online and see what assignments their children have to finish for the week. Students, teachers, and parents can utilize a school's website for district news, library resources, or to communicate by E-mail if there are any problems.  What the article emphasizes is the use of Internet media as a medium for this exchange of ideas. This has not come to fruition yet in public schools. Library media centers use poor filtering systems that block out pornography (sometimes) but also research articles on Margaret Sanger or Adolf Hitler. In turn, E-mail is also banned. Websites of schools often go a semester or more without being updated.   The most frustrating thing about the current situation is that the technology that is used is often not compatible with what the students use at home. I am writing this paper right now in a West Seneca district school that lacks a PC. A copy of the Simplicio article remains in a floppy disk in my jacket, as the Macintosh cannot read the .pdf file it is stored on. I would E-mail the article to myself, but the filter would not allow it. Uploading this paper to an Internet site that I could access later resulted in one of many messages warning me that anything I click on could be viewed by a third party, which somehow erased the completed first version of this essay. It will not be until schools accept online communication for what it is meant to be, and not treat it like a closed-circuit television channel, that the rewards of having a computer in every classroom will be realized.

      CD: Erykah Badu, "Baduism"  Had a dang rockin' time on my radio show this morning. It's an odd situation that I play music at 3 AM on a Monday, because in one way I don't want anyone to listen so I can play whatever I want, and in another way I want people to listen to the strangeness I put on. And nobody is in the radio station that early in the morning, let alone awake on the campus, so I pretty much own the school for three hours. Today I played some of my favorite female rock acts--Bikini Kill, L7, Sleater-Kinney, and even Erykah Badu--and went on a small rant over how the station will put an overproduced group like Puffy AmiYumi on rotation (giant sellers in Southeast Asia, and even have their own dolls) but not the fanastically overproduced pop of Natalie Imbruglia. That discussion is one I'm sure I could only have with myself, and at 4:30 in the morning to boot.

      Cassette (yes, I have cassettes!): Cowboy Mouth, "Word Of Mouth"  An hour ago I got an E-mail from AmericanSingles.com. I vaguely remember signing up for an online dating service about two years ago, when I was trying to earn points for one of those goofy Read E-mail For Money schemes. Anyway, I found that in my small hick town of 3000 people there are about five women my age who have ALSO signed up at AmericanSingles.com, and have done so for reasons such as "looking for a date, nothing serious right now" or "a real man who knows how to treat a lady." Well, I'm not very serious.... Some of these people actually seem interesting, maybe even attractive. Nevertheless, I refuse to lower my nonexistent standards to contact one of these people based on the prejudiced assumption that doing so would bruise the social reputation I don't have. So there. And Hunnybunz82, I think I live down the street from you; tell your dog to shut up!

      CD: Frogs, "Starjob" promo  This is the 100th blog post. I started this blog in the summer hoping that it would help me learn to write about myself so I could better write up job applications, keep my essay writing skills up to snuff before graduate school started, to finally force myself to write a diary, and communicate with some of the friends I don't see anymore. None of these plans really succeeded, but here we are four months later. The posts have not changed much; sometimes I write them a day or two ahead of time now, and the tone somehow changed when people started saying they read the blogs on a regular basis (the one thing I regret is that fame has affected my art, though I am neither famous nor artistic). There are a lot of times when I am not listening to the CD I have written at the top of the post, but I have listened to it in the past 24 hours. (Right now I am listening to The Melvin's "The Bit" promo EP if you care.)  One really important rule that I set early on is that I must never write about anything important. Usually what I type is the farthest thing from my mind at the particular time, or only a small part of what's on it. I will never devote webblogs to my woman troubles, family problems, serious personal vices or anything of that nature. That way I can write something, forget about it, and the words will probably not be used against me later (part of the reason I record my E-mails and IMs as well).  But man, I hate these pop-ups, don't you? I can't stand these stupid things.   Well, my CD is done; I'm going to bed. Joe, you should really write on your blog. Ed, keep it up. Dave, you were an inspiration; too bad you're not still doing one. Anyone else who wants one can write to me.

      CD: Beastie Boys, "Root Down EP"  Some days I get to go in for work and there is nothing to do. When teachers are absent, they oftentimes just have their substitutes watch over study halls, or watch videos with their class. Not a bad job, really. Today was one of those days. All of my classes were canceled for something called "Orienteering," which involves teams of kids walking around the athletic fields, finding different stations and doing tasks to complete a checklist of Fun Activities. My station was called "Grab Bag," where students get a random free prize. That's it. I'm not going to sit out in a wet field in my good shoes for two hours playing trick-or-treat. What does that teach you, huh? So with permission of a number of parent volunteers (they thought I was one of them) I came up with a task:  "Okay, this is called Grab Bag, where you basically get a free prize for doing nothing. But that's no fun, so here's what you have to do. [pointing] I want you to run around those bleachers over there three times. This is the catch: do you know the song for Meow Mix cat food?"  Group of five [puzzled]: "Yeah...."  "You have to sing it while you run, as loud as you can. Got it?"  G5: "Uh...oh...kay..." [ten seconds later] "MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW! MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW...!"  "I said LOUD!"  Subbing rocks.

      CD: Beck, "Sea Change"  Today I visited the University of Buffalo Campus, got lost, and ended up in Lockport. I don't know. Actually I drove around Lockport, meaning I pretty much ended up a little south of Niagara Falls. I usually know the names of the little villages around the area, so when I drove past one of those "Welcome to" signs and found myself reading it twice to get the pronounciation right, I knew I had really screwed up my trip. At least I found those pillars near that lake. You know, that thing? With the thing? The greatest thing I got from the trip was realizing that when people talk about the University of Rochester they say "U of R" but when they talk about the University of Buffalo they say "UB." There is no "U of B." What a mindfudge. Then again, so is figuring out how I made it to Lockport...

      CD: various, "Surge Studio"  If I remember correctly, a couple of months ago I wrote an insightful little piece about a pair of pants whose zipper would not stay all the way up. Whether a defect in the manufacturing of the pants or intense gravitational pull on the zipper (insert joke here) does not matter; the point is the zipper only tended to stay up half way. When I told this to several people--ever have those lulls in the conversation where you don't know what to say next?--their reply was always, unequivocably: "Why don't you just get a safety pin?" Ew gross no! I am not eight, and I am not putting pins at precarious places in my pants.   Anyway, the update. I came into one of my graduate classes, and waited for the professor to arrive. When he did, I noticed that a number of specific appearance traits such as his bushy, landscaped eyebrows, his loud yet often see-through dress shirts, and a haircut that might be prosthetic, there was also a very nice pair of pants--with a safety pin hanging off the zipper. See, THAT's why I wouldn't do it!

      CD: Wipers, various mix CD #2  Here I sit so brokenhearted, waiting for a class that hasn't started.... I'm sure the deluge is a-comin'. It's gotta be, because two classes of mine are cancelled next week. All of my classes, however, have Giant Projects due, with deadlines that are distant but becoming ever more visible. All of this dead time is making me feel uneasy. I keep reassuring myself that one of these days I'm going to wake up and remember all too late that my fifteen page paper on the life of the tsetse fly (or whatever we learn in Education classes) has to be handed in that morning and I completely forgot to start it. That's why I'm doing nothing right now, right? Because I forgot to do something? Do I have anything due for the class I have in twenty minutes? I must have checked three times now. Did I wash my hands? Maybe I should wash my hands.

      CD: Illegal Art artists, "Deconstructing Beck"  So here I am, still at school, after getting here at three in the morning. My first radio show was a smash, considering nobody listens at 3 AM and on three occasions I forgot to turn on my microphone when I spoke. Since I didn't want to go home just to sleep, I staked a claim at the top floor of the library in a dim corner, and learned how to make my backpack a pillow. That worked for about three hours. Then I decided it was time for lunch, and enjoyed a walk around Elmwood and a bite to eat. Then, since I was only running on those three hours of sleep--back to sleep! In fact, this time I slept too long, and missed the first twenty minutes of my class, which was the very reason I stayed on campus all day in the first place. Geez. And even worse--or is it--when I apologized for being late the professor quite bluntly stated she had no idea I was gone, and then said "It's okay; at least you were in the library." Tally: Hours spent at school 18, Hours spent studying 0.

      CD: Eddie Vedder, various mix CD  Today is my brother's birthday. My brother was born about eleven months and three weeks before my sister, meaning that for one week every year they were the same age. I can vividly remember these from growing up, because for that one week my brother didn't have a little sister to beat up. He actually had to think twice, because he had to doubly justify his oppressive behavior. He would have to say something like "Nuh-uh, I'm still older than you 'cuz I was born first!" and she would reply "But I'm _x_ years old too so we're even!" Kids can't really get legal the way Johnny Cochrane can, so he was kind of stuck by this part of the debate. As a result, he would beat my sister harder than he usually did. Strangely, looking back on it I think she didn't mind as much, because for this once-in-a-blue-moon event she still had him, you know?

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, various mix CD  Since I've started a job that requires me to get up sometimes at five in the morning, I get to see a lot of things that I haven't in a long time. This, of course, is because I usually go to bed at five in the morning. However, there is something truly serene early in the day when you can see sunlight but not the sun, when the air still feels crisp and damp, when the the only people you see are delivering the morning paper. It's quiet, it's fresh, and though there is a full day ahead it feels like there is nowhere else you really have to be. A pre-coffee morning: nothing but you in some clean clothes and a waking but rested body. Between 5 and 5:30 AM, despite work, errands, and war on the evening news, it is still a good day.

      CD: Black Flag, various mix CD  Oh diggity, today I'm unemployed. That's what's so wonderful and magical about being a substitute teacher: you never know if you're working that day, UNTIL that day. Today at 7 AM I got a call to work, but that was too late; I can't get in on time unless they call between 5:30 and 6:30 in the morning. (Gee, I recall the nights when I used to go to bed at that time. They were two months ago.) So that call failed. An hour later, another call, this one asking me to teach, I mean "teach," middle school gym. Seeing how I majored in History in college, and played basketball twice in those four years, well, I didn't take that one either. And then, an hour after that: "Are you available to teach elementary school?" Oh heck. Colors, clocks and the numbers from 1 to 20? I can barely do that now! Darned if I can walk down the halls in a straight line. In conclusion, today is my day off, and I haven't slept well.

      CD: Black Flag, "Damaged"  The results are in from a yearlong study that searched to find the funniest joke in the world. You know what? They apparently found it, and it's not that funny. Something about some guys from New Jersey shooting each other. They say that Brits and Australians really like the puns, Germans think anything's funny, Canadians don't laugh, and Americans love to make fun of people that are better than them. Here's my favorite American joke: A Texan and a Harvard man are talking to each other.   Texan: So, where you from?  Harvard: Where I come from, we don't put prepositions at the ends of our sentences.  Texan: OK, so where you from, jackass?  Today I was also thinking about someday having a talk show on TV, just so I could invite Jimmy Dean's wife on it. And I would get to ask her, "So, how often do you eat "Jimmy Dean's Sausage?" Thanks, you've been a great audience.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  You know, it's a little bit disturbing when you're searching around the internet and end up looking at pornography by mistake. It's my personal opinion that I like good surprises, like winning the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes, and getting pornographic pop-ups is not one of those good surprises. Anyway, it's even worse when it appears on your screen when in your school's library. Did you know you can get charged with sexual harrassment if a boob ends up on your screen? Not cool. So take it from me, kids: when you're bored, don't start typing random words in the browser to see if they're actual sites. Especially if the site takes you to "blood.com". And by the way, "flickingboogers.com", disappointingly, does not exist.

      CD: Beck, "Sea Change"  The message board at this site is now officially closed. Officially as in you can still post on it, but who the heck is going to read it? I mean really, no one's read the thing in weeks. I'm happy it's gone, really, because it's a pain reading it at home. Case in point: I wrote a post about my sister a few days ago, and I sent her the link in an E-mail. It was her birthday, and I told her today that I was going out to get her present. She replied, "You're going to buy me that digital camera? Cool!" "Whuh?" "That link to the digital camera that you sent in the E-mail!" I still had no clue. Then I realized that when she clicked on the link the only thing she saw was the pop-up ad. She never saw the post about her at all. THAT's why I'm switching to dissek.com.

      CD: Patti Smith, "Gung Ho"  Today I came home to find not only ice cream, but chocolate cake, pumpkin pie, cookies, and best of all, Cool Whip. Yes, the brand! Dinner was awesome. When it came time for dessert (which was about half of the entire meal) I quickly busted out the goods. When it came time for the coup de grace--the CW--I tried opening it as I pulled it out of the fridge. It slipped out of my hands. Trying to grasp it, somehow I got my right hand stuck partway inside the bucket. Still in midair, I could see the bucket was going to fall in the wastebasket. No, not the Cool Whip! My left hand quickly moved into action. I don't know how, but the left hand was able to swing the jar towards my body so I could prevent it from hitting the ground. In the process I got a big gob of whipped cream on my pants, and my right hand was covered entirely by the sticky stuff. What now? Do you have to ask?! It was the tastiest accident ever! The only evidence that remains is the streak of white stuff on the rim of the garbage can from when I got so excited.

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  At work the television is set stagnant on CNN Headline News. Usually I look at Headline News like I look at USA Today, pointing to an article and telling myself "that's not news, that's useless information." You know, those trivial pie charts on the bottom corner of each section, the blockbuster movie previews on the front page that push a real headine involving national or international politics over to the side. And don't get me started on their "Viewpoints" page. Today I tried looking at Headline News from the perspective of someone trying to learn about capitalism. I learned tons. Headline News has about 8 minutes of commercials, like any other channel, as well as promos that start "Up next..." for their own profit. That's probably another two minutes, including inter-anchor banter. They always talk about the new movies out on screen or on DVD that you can buy, which is another four minutes of time. One of their biggest stories of the day was The First Day of the Christmas Shopping Season, complete with footage of people running like Legion's pigs into a shopping mall. Another two minutes. With that, a wonderful little segment on gifts you can buy for Christmas, with new computer gadgets and someone in a Hello Kitty suit. Four more minutes? Then sports, talking about team ownership and trade disputes and contract negotiations. There were some scores too, but let's give commercialism four more minutes here, since sports in America are for-profit industries. What else? Some report about how oil refineries are getting a bad rap for their environmental problems, but don't worry, their stocks aren't slipping and they look like a solid investment. Really, that was the conclusion of the piece. Five minutes there. And I almost forgot the stock market report; another minute! Now, count it up. What did I learn in half an hour?

The time he hired a mariachi band to play in a neighbor lady's cubicle for her birthday? Today's episode was especially cool, because R.E.M. was the musical guest. Not the 1990s R.E.M. that everybody knows, but the indie newbies R.E.M. from 1983! They played twice, and one of the songs didn't even have a name because it was so new! AND they got an interview! (Michael Stipe hid behind Mike Mills during the entire thing). That's good TV! And to top it off, the featured guest was Julia Childs, who made ham and cheese sandwiches with Budweiser Beer! ROCK!

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Judas 0"  Is it spelled triptophane? Anyhoo, Thanksgiving is the only time in America where it is considered polite to overeat. If you do not take seconds, or try at least two kinds of pie, you are a rude guest/host/family member. Aunt Ethel was working all day to make those 23 pies, galldurnit, eat sumpthin'! I find it strange because here in America two-thirds of us are overweight. You'd think that there were other days where this was really acceptable. Yes, Christmas is filled with ham and whatnot, but it's more about spending money (more about that later). The Fourth of July has hot-dog eating contests, but the latest champion--two years running--has been Japanese (competitors say it's unfair because the Japanese have two stomachs; no joke)! Easter has those big chocolate bunnies where you bite the ears off first, but nobody ever finishes them. On a side note, I was wondering why they didn't have big chocolate Jesuses instead, and then I though about how we eat the bunnies. For the first time, the chocolate rabbits made sense!   Do I?

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  I'm waiting on a friend. Is that a Rolling Stones song? Last week, one hundred students sat in this very computer lab and refused to leave as a protest against short library hours. I admire that, and would have joined in the protest had I known about it, but dang! How did they stay here so long without being bored about of their minds? They were probably Talking Amongst Themselves. Here I have the Internet, which is like saying "A weekend in jail isn't too bad as long as you have a good novel to read!" And the people I usually talk to? That's who I'm waiting for! So I must wait here alone at a computer hoping for an IM because I don't own a cell phone and the pay phones are fifty cents now and I could use my calling card but with pay phones they take an extra nine minutes off so what's that use and There they are. Thank goodness, I'm starving. I'll see you folks later.  "Brute Force Method. Eat 'em and smile." --Tim Schrock

      CD: U2, "Best Of 1990-2000: The B-Sides"  I took last week off of work so I could get homework done. I'm old enough now so that I don't believe I'll actually get anything accomplished, and I've lived up to my own hype. Five full days and nothing to show for it. How many times did I have the books in my hands, ready to type? How many times did I mentally plan out the days when I would get A, B, C, and D done, even down to a calculation of pages written per day? How many times did I say to myself, "I shall go get a piece of pie/check the mail/watch TV for 30 minutes and then start"? How many times did I finally give up and go to bed early? How many licks does it take to get to the center of my problem? One? A-two? A-three? I guess I'll never know. O sweet, sugary procrastination, how you torment me!

      CD: Ravel, "Bolero"  As I sat trying to find extra room in my stomach for the fish fry special, a dreadful thought occurred to me: on Thanksgiving Day, I will be required to stuff inordinate amounts of [bland] food into my body in an act of blind patriotism. Chances are I won't be cooking it, and the chances are even greater that I won't deserve it. So while at the diner, stuffed, I decided that I will fast for Thanksgiving; well, as much as I can without looking rude. The leftovers usually last until Christmas dinner anyway, so I won't be missing anything. But I definitely won't have breakfast or lunch, and I'm thinking of skipping dinner the night before as well. We'll be going to Grandma's for pie later--I'll partake in that because if I don't I'll be disowned.  Which reminds me: the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year. It is also National Don't Buy Anything Day, a protest against the pervasive commercialization of our culture. Instead of going shopping, spend some quality time with the family. Take a walk or make a snowman (where applicable), create handmade gifts, call a loved one. Don't let the Coca-Cola Santa tell you how to celebrate a religious holiday!   Or, just get some homework done. You promised you would...

      CD: The Presidents Of The United States Of America, "The Presidents Of The United States Of America"  Yesterday there was an ammonia leak at the Perry's Ice Cream plant about six doors down, at about 1 in the morning. The air was acidicly pungent: the ammonia got in your eyes, nose and mouth. It was odd because I was taking out the garbage at the time, so I thought it was that, and then I realized that my nose was burning from the inside, and there were cops and firemen all over the street. Within about 30 minutes we were asked to evacuate. "Evacuate" is the key word here, so my mother slept through the whole thing and my brother just kind of sat around. My sister went to visit a friend in Buffalo. My father tried turning all the lights off so the cops wouldn't come over, but when he found out they needed to pick up citizens with school buses he got all excited and volunteered to drive.  I was just about to go to bed, and though I wasn't worried about it I figured I'd check out the scene. Everyone without a place to go was asked to relocate to the town fire hall, so I drove up there. There were about 100-120 people there, mostly young families and really, really old people. It seems like fire halls are havens for senior citizens, what with the bingo display and the stacks of "Forever Young" magazine hanging around. I grabbed me a mag and enjoyed a nice cup of water. They broke out the coffee, pretzels and potato chips, and eventually the cold cuts and bread, but I just came for the atmosphere. Televisions were playing Conan O'Brien, with periodic crawls about us that didn't really tell us anything except that "no injuries have been reported." It was pretty boring.  The Channel 2 news truck was there, however. I don't think the reporter found much to talk about, but I could see him going for the Old Person interview, looking for the oldest, most haggard-looking people he could find. Shortly afterward we were told the police would let us back home. I stayed five more minutes to watch the local news; a young family also stayed because, of course, the dad knew they were going to broadcast live and he wanted to walk past the camera ON AIR! Whee!   So did I. Once the guy's report started I walked out the door, right behind the interview. Wouldn't you know, but waiting outside in an idle bus was my father, waiting to give people a ride.   "What's going on?" he asked.  "I just got on TV."  "Could you tell the people inside that a bus is waiting for them?"  I did, but only the young couple got on. Everyone had pretty much left except some really old people who had nothing better to do. This morning the power went out, meaning there's more trouble at the plant, but it's an ice cream plant, not a nuclear reactor, and there isn't much to worry about. So anyway, that was my evening.   Man: "Did you see me?! Did you see me walk by?!" Wife: "I did! You were on the TV screen!" Man: "Ha ha!"

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  A couple of nights ago I had a dream that Ed was dead. "But Fred," you could have said, "your head was in bed. Ed's not dead!" 'Tis true. At first I felt bad about the whole thing. After all, Ed being dead would be a bad thing. After a couple more minutes of dreaming I realized: I was supposed to visit Ed with Joe next month. Now what? I should call Joe! I wonder if he found out, too. Maybe I would have to break the bad news to him. I don't know Joe's phone number well enough to dial him in my dreams, so in the last few minutes of sleep I was able to assess the situation. How did Ed die? I should have probably found out. Who could I ask? Probably the person that told me he died. Who was that? I don't remember. Why not? Did anyone actually tell me? Hmm, awful fuzzy. Is Ed really dead? If he's not, am I making all this up? Why would I make all this up? Am I dreaming? Did I get up this morning? No? Well there you go. And then I woke up.  So in conclusion, Ed just posted a letter about going to the Danko Jones show last night so I have conclusive proof that he's alive. Thank goodness!   "I might not be the flashiest dresser in the room/I might not know how to look a girl in the eye/I might not have the right pick-up lines/but I'll show you what I got/you see when I was growing up I got the inside scoop I used to watch all the fellows down the block/when they worked I watched and I learned the Lovercall."

      CD: Beastie Boys, "Licensed To Ill"  I have an aversion to pork for disgestive reasons. It just doesn't dissipate correctly or something; if I were an expert in those kinds of matters I could explain in medical terms the more disgusting aspects of the situation while still sounding somewhat dignified. Nevertheless, I still find myself dealing with hot dogs on a regular basis. My intention is never to just "go get a hot dog" because I am always looking for better fare. There it sits in the fridge, however, taunting me. Say I am about to make some soup, or reheat a casserole. Hey, I can eat a hot dog while I wait? Then, somehow I must finished the package I opened. Nuts...by the end of the night I've had four or five of the things and my stomach is re-enacting that ship-on-stormy-seas scene from the Pepto-Bismol commercial. What are these things made of, anyway?  Studio mic: "C'mon, Dave, gimme a break." David Lee Roth: "One break, comin' up!"

      CD: Van Halen, "Diver Down"  Blank Tapes! Everyone must get they'selves some Blank Tapes. This week I had a great radio show, where each song was preceded by an audio clip from that great movie, "Shaft." It was so good it should have been recorded. And you know what? It WAS, thanks to Blank Tapes! Now I can relive all of the great moments I had, which in some cases will be the first time because I kept falling asleep! And last night, whilst watching reruns of Saturday Night Live on Comedy Central, they just happened to be playing the episode where the one and only Natalie Imbruglia sings! Thanks to Blank Tapes, I have this earth-shattering, breakthrough first American performance close at hand for all posterity! Thank you, Natalie, for an amazing live version of "Torn!" And thank YOU, Blank Tapes!  Shaft: "Why don't you stop playing with yourself, Willie?"

      CD: The Police, "Ghost In The Machine"  Cops are really friendly, but the only time you see them are when you've done something wrong. The same goes with judges; sure, they're polite, but they're also just about to throw you in jail or sentence you to death or something like that so when they smile it can really be aggrivating. I haven't had that sort of problem yet, because my crimes are so petty they're laughable in their own right. Getting up in front of a judge, then, is almost fun in my case. Last night I paid (through the nose) for a speeding ticket, but the cops and the judge were just so NICE about the whole thing. I even found out that the judge was the guy that fixed up my brother's old car a few months ago, to donate it to the City Mission. Now that's a nice guy! I paid $125.  Judge: "So why were you going so fast?" Woman: "I was late for a class..." J: "Oh, what do you study?" W: "Criminal Justice." [court breaks out in laughter]

      CD: Beck, "Mellow Gold"  Some time ago I parked in a lot near my school, and a bum proceeded to ask me for money. I wasn't going to give him any, but I was late anyhow so I couldn't even pretend to listen to him for a minute...  Bum: "Excuse me sir, but I was wondering if I could have a few minutes of your time. My wife and I have fallen on hard..."  Me: "I'm late for class! I gotta go!"  Bum: "OH!!" You ALWAYS 'GOTTA GO!!'"  That memory is still burned into my mind. Last week, however, another bum "helped me park" in downtown Buffalo. I thought about karma, listened to his speech, got tired of it quickly, and just handed over two bucks. You can't get anything for a buck these days, so I gave him two. Well, you can get 20 minutes worth of calls anywhere in the U.S. for only 99 cents, but I assume he doesn't have a phone. So there, two dollars. Still not feeling very nice because I tried bribing a bum to get him to leave me alone, I put about a dollar's worth of change in the Salvation Army bucket at Wal-Mart the next day.   Karma is real! That very day I also returned the pop cans that were lying around my house, and the money it made me was equal to the amount I gave to the Army and the second panhandler. Just like in "Abbey Road"!

      CD: Spice Girls, "Spice"  Recently I bought some new clothes, which is pretty much a once-a-year event. It used to be because I didn't have the money to get new clothes. I have the money now, but I don't need to wear anything. Well, that's not entirely the case. But I have several sets of clothes:  1.) Formal wear. Never wear it, never wash it, never wear it out. I have the same dress shoes I had in eighth grade.  2.) Dress clothes. You know, decent pants and maybe a tie. I wear these about a third of the time, so you can probably throw two or three shirts in the hamper after the week, as well as three good pairs of socks. This is for actual work, and I have the five shirts I need to get me through a good month if I mix it up right.  3.) A crappy work uniform. Only on weekends, and then they're hidden from the other five days.  4.) Xenophobe wear. When I come home, I put these on. Usually, plaid pajama bottoms with an equally disgusting plait button shirt. I probably look like ICP on the PGA Tour but I'm not leaving the house, am I?  After that, what else do I need? I do the laundry once a week (maybe) and no one is the wiser. And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get out of my 3 and change into my 4; have a good night.

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Riot Act"  I'm working my way down to one meal a day again, but sensible meals this time. I used to eat one meal a day, but that meal would be, say, one pound of spahgetti and a couple Fluffernutter sandwiches. Now it involves a decent sandwich (hopefully from Subway!) and a glass of Something. So far this has been working pretty well. Last night, however, I decided to splurge on a salad. Oh man, I can't believe I just typed that. Anyway, this happened to be a salad from a truck stop, meaning that I had to find the lettuce under a quilt of cheese. Good cheese, yes, but still. And the salad was accompanied by a mug (yep!) full of Ranch dressing. Do you ever wonder why truck drivers have guts bigger than some states' panhandles, even when they don't drink most of the time? It's because the healthiest food they eat has fat like Oprah has...well, fat.   "Eve was framed" --bumper sticker

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Innervisions"  Belatedly, I must give a shout out to the supposedly loosely-related Congressman Ed Schrock of Virginia on his recent election to a second term in the United States House of Representatives. Ed Schrock is a stauch supporter of Reagan-era economics and international policies and can't stand gays in the military, which he believes was a failed experiment by the the Clinton Administration that ruined troop morale (this was an integral part of his campaign). He also served two tours in Vietnam and looks kind of like my grandpa. With 84% of the vote, Schrock defeated his Green Party challenger by a more than 5-1 ratio. Congratulations, Ed.

      CD: Erykah Badu, "Mama's Gun"  I spend longer amounts of time in my car now that my commutes between work, home, and school are more than twenty miles in any direction. It is not inordinate to find myself driving from 90 minutes to two hours a day. This means I listen to a lot of CDs, which I turn up until my ears hum and my mouth starts a feeble attempt at harmonizing with females and falsettos. But what to listen to when, say, your mother is in your car? Today I searched my CD collection in vain and settled on Green Day. I figured she couldn't take Beck or Radiohead ("Why do you have to listen to such depressing music?") and finally settled with Green Day. If you turn it way, way down, all you can hear is chord changes and no swearing. Past studies have shown that moms like Weezer but can't stand Nirvana. Jazz just makes the trip seem longer. Also, the Beatles are great but you have to let Mom do the choruses.   "I love how ESPN has NBA games on now. This is the change my life needed." --Jeff Gross

      CD: Alan Parsons Project, "Master Hits"'  Awwwww...I got me a new winter jacket today. "Tis sweet. All soft on the inside and with big pockets on the outside, with a giant hood that makes me look like i'm in a Naughy By Nature video. It's also a large size, meaning that hood can make me look like a scared turtle if pulled over my head. I hope to use this jacket during my upcoming trip to Europe, where I will spend a number of overnights on a train. I envision sitting in my seat, mummified by my coat, oblivious to the continent speeding past me as I get some well-deserved sleep. Most people are not energized by coat purchases, but this is my first new one since 8th grade--yes, 8th grade!--and to have a coat without missing lining or buttons is like manna. Maybe tonight I will sleep on the floor, in my new jacket, like a seven-year-old girl to her new swimsuit.

      CD: Radiohead, "OK Computer"  Yesterday my manager came up to me, and in a very serious tone told me, "you have a call." I never get calls at work, and I wondered who it might be. The man on the other end identified himself as a Chief Operations Officer for the company:  Him: Is this Frederick Schrock? Me: Yes... H: How are you doing today? M: Good, good... H: We recently found out that you were traveling to Europe in the next few months, and we were wondering if you would be a Secret Shopper for us in some of our franchises there.

By the way, Fred, it's Ed. How've you been?  Ed called from Germany. I haven't heard from him for three months, and got my work number from a friend in Nashville.

      11 11 02   CD: Portishead, "Portishead"  Tonight's topic is ice cream. When my family buys ice cream there is usually a big debate over what to get, and the ice cream is usually categorized into three main categories:  Vanilla. This means regular vanilla about 90% of the time, but may sometimes branch out to other bland flavors such as Maple Walnut. I do not hate these flavors but they don't make me very happy. These are the flavors the parents want to eat, without any reason other than brash conservativism. One may consider "Cookies  Cream" in this section, but it is rarely agreed chosen (too bad, too).  Fruit. This involves strawberries, usually. Or cherries. Or blueberries, or a whole mix of them in what is usually a vanilla-based flavor called "All American Moose" or something odd like that. Of course, you could always just buy vanilla and add fruit to it later, but then the ice cream just wouldn't look so neat coming out of the box. In my opinion, utterly useless.  Chocolate. In some form, chocolate must be present. ("Cookies  Cream" MAY count.) The best ones are the Death by Chocolates, the Fudge Brownies, the Mint Ting-A-Lings, the Cookie Doughs, the Peanut Butter Cups. I only approve of these kinds. Why? Because they have flavor, they taste like a real dessert (Strawberries!? Save them for brunch!) and thank goodness they have chocolate, the most important taste since Water. Why anything else?  I make it a point to be present during the Ice Cream Selection Process because I insist on having at least one chocolate ice cream chosen. In these later, more refined years, I almost refuse to eat any other kind. C'mon people...vanilla? If I put milk in the freezer long enough I can make something just like it. How about adding some magic cocoa beans, dude?! And chop up some candy bars in there so we can have two desserts at once! You gotta make sure it sits heavy in my stomach, because I'll be eating it for breakfast--the most important meal of the day!

      CD: Limp Bizkit, "3 Dollar Bill, Y'All"' (this one's really lousy)  I was just thinking about what I would do if I was Iraq. Not Saddam Hussein, but Iraq, because I'm not sure if I can sympathize with him. So say I'm Iraq. You've been bombing me just about every day for the past ten years, a little here and there. And now you want me to disarm, because now--suddenly--I'm a threat to you again. All these daily bombings were just a little recess horseplay, I guess. But anyway, unless I disarm and make myself completely vulnerable to attack, I'm going to be attacked and then disarmed. Either way, I'm going to get pantsed in the lunch line. So I can either eat my government-subsidized lunch without any pants on or drop the lunch and try beating up the guy that's been bullying me for ten years. Sure, I'm really hungry and could use the food. But isn't it still worth it? I just don't know...   Hannah: "Ed called you." Fred: "When did he call?" H: "Eight o'clock."

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  One thing I miss about college is the late classes. Sure, freshman year you are stuck with Intro To Useless Info at eight in the morning, but by the time you're a junior you're getting up at noon, and don't have classes on Friday. (At least, that was my situation. Bwah ha ha.) But in the "real" world, apparently this is not the case anymore. Waking up at 5:30, 5:39, 5:48, 5:57 and 6:06 is a big pain compared to Eventually Getting Out Of Bed around 11ish. This morning I was even later than normal because I had to wait my turn for use of the shower, something I haven't had to do since the Clinton Administration. Then there's "rush hour", probably the first time the movie's been better than the thing it was based on, and a modern-day oxymoron to boot. Dif'rent Strokes, I guess.

      CD: Medeski Martin  Wood, "Uninvisible"  I was supposed to stop talking about Subway sandwiches but I just can't. This story, however, is the best of all. As previously seen on "Blog," a customer enjoys Subway sandwiches, goes temporarily insane, and decides he wants to write the company telling them how great they are. Yesterday, they wrote back. I got an official letter from the central office (On Subway letterhead! Yes!) thanking me for my interest in the Subway family and for my words of encouragement. THEN I look again into the envelope and whoopdie-doo, there are THREE two dollar coupons off the purchase of any Subway product! That's right, they gave me $6 just for writing an E-mail! So if you're hungry, poor, and have E-mail access (it's hard getting that Trifecta) log on to www.subway.com and claim your free food!

      CD: The Busdrivers, promo EP  Unpacking from a trip is a real pain. I think it is especially tedious when the trip wasn't very long. There are clothes, of course. That's the most time consuming. I have yet to see someone who still had a neat suitcase when they came back home; usually there is a roughshod pile of debris crammed into one side of the case while the other side has some layers of clean clothes mixed in with random souveniers, as tectonic shifting has caused the folded shirts to mix with, say, the socks or a snowglobe. All clothes, whether worn or not, must be washed. Clean clothes may have been contaminated by close location to the "dirty clothes bag" and a lack of fresh airflow. Then comes the cleanup of miscellany: receipts, brochures you kept for no reason whatsoever, camera film rolls, that hotel card key you ended up not having to return to the front desk. Those don't have to be washed, but you have to find them first. During the trip you have excercised every one of the 13 pockets in your suitcase for the sake of convenience, and now you can't find a thing. Don't tell yourself these objects are useless, however, even though they are. If not cleared away, you'll be in Orlando finding cough drops you put in your bag in Washington three years before, look at it for a second, think "what the hey, why not," eat it and die of pneumonia a month later. It happened to President Harrison, you know.  Q: "Heigh ho for our Cape Cod, Heigh ho Nantasket, Do not let the Boston wags Feel your oyster basket." -Original verse to "Yankee Doodle"

      CD: Cee-Lo, "Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect Imperfections"  While taking a driving break on a trip from Terre Haute, Indiana to Buffalo, New York, my buddy Dave and I stopped to eat at a Blimpie's Subs outside of Akron, Ohio. But this wasn't just a Blimpie's Subs, oh no. In the same room as the sub shop was a Nextel cellular phone dealership, bottled wines for sale, a candy shop, condoms (right next to the suckers on the shelves, and several giant windows where you could see the automatic car wash at work. Also, the room was half of a building where a full Dodge dealership was located. How does a room make any sense? So in conclusion, if I were to anthropologically study the people of Akron, Ohio based on this store I would see wine and clean cars, condoms and kids' candy, and cell phones and automobiles. And I would think to myself, "These people have no laws."  Today starts the daily Random Quote. At the end of each post I will quote something I read or heard that day that I think will stand alone as an interesting statement:  "Fred's always dickin' around with lunch meat." Dave Hill

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  So I'm going on a road trip, coming up last Friday. [See 11/01] And I driving my good buddy Dave for ten hours. Dave is one of many people who do not trust my directional skills, which is a shame; I unconsciously take scenic routes, probably led by a Higher Power for reasons mere mortals cannot explain, but all I hear from my passengers is: "We're not lost again, are we?" We always get there, and usually within a close approximation of being On Time. I don't see the problem. And I just know that the first turn I make, Dave will yell about something: about how I took it too fast; about how I was supposed to go left, not right; about how I almost hit that Kid On A Bike; how I am going to hit that car in front of me; and the ubiquitous "Who taught you to drive?" Silly crabs, trips are for Freds!

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  Hi again. On Thursday I decided to break out the ol' pile of sweaters put away since last year. I did this because it's cold, of course. And with that sentence I have driven my post into a brick wall.  So anyway, I wanted to wear one of the sweaters that day. Since it was put away so long, however, there was a big crease from where it was folded. I was going to take a shower anyway, so I put it on a hangar in the bathroom. Water running, I tried to think of ways to bring more steam into the room. Hmm. Well, I could close the door. HAHAHAHA! Just kidding. But I did close the door of the Closet in the bathroom; that helped. What else would concentrate the steam towards the sweater? I ended up bring several larger items, such as my me-sized clothes hamper into the room, so as to take up more space, pushing the steam--hopefully--nearer the area of my sweater.  All of my extra planning took about 20 minutes, and by that time there was barely any hot water to take a shower with. So that was schwag. Also, the crease never came out. Schwag again. Finally, no one noticed the crease. Bonus. See, entropy means a happy ending!

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  Well I'm going on a little trip tomorrow and since I won't post any fantastic updates about my important life in the next few days, I figured I could just do it now. Also, I am here in the computer lab waiting for something to finish printing, so what else am I supposed to do? The printer here is one of those older ones that use the long, attached pieces of paper with the holes on both sides. Yeah, the cheap stuff. Teachers won't accept them so that's why I can print out half a ream for free. Looking at it now, however, I realize that I can barely read half of the font. You know how some people spell "encyclopedia" with that conjoined "AE" thing? All of the letters on the page look like that. And the numbers? Don't even ask. Like a just scanned some kindergardener's glitter art.

      Been awake now for a long time, but actual, factual data on that will require subtraction, something Iâm not yet in the mood forâ¦1:15 PM EST, so Iâve been up for 27.25 hours. There. Writing this on a train from Bielefield (sp?) to Berlin with a broken dinner trayâexcuse the poorer handwriting. The flight in got a little bumpy but overall it was greatâeven got a free continental breakfast! It was plenty better than that reheated chicken hide or whatever for dessert. Anyway, Deusseldorf International is awful quiet at 7 AM. Havenât seen the sun yet; maybe I will in the morning. Ed Jr. has confused everyone by doing errands while he tries to show us around the place. We went to the bank like 4 times today, for example. And speaking of the bank, and of subtraction, my debit card does not work here; dangit. We were able to go to the bank and get 100 bucks out of a credit card but we tried to pay for a hotel with it and it got denied. Donât know what that means, exactly; will have to make a few meaningless phone calls. Since I can barely keep conscience [sic] I better go before I go comatose.

      $7 for a battery? A battery? This trip is already expensive. I wonder how many surcharges my credit card will tack on when Iâm buying waffles in Belgium. Anyho, the trip will start in about 1 hour when I start taking my Dramamine. Actually, itâs the generic, Wal-Mart Dramamine that comes in packs of 100, instead of 8. 8? Iâve got more traveling than that to do! H*ck, I was feeling a little queasy on the ride hereâ¦So in this next hour I have to find something to do:  1) The Landmark Bar, right across the hall. Dressed up in that Art Decoish, Frank Lloyd Wrightish stuff. I feel like gettingâ me a sandwich.  2) GAMEBOY ADVANCE! Just got it for Christmas yesterday. Now I bought 3 more games on the way here! There is no way Iâm going to have a boring flight, not with Donkey Kong, Tony Hawk and good olâ Gradius to keep me company. And sure, I could talk to Joe as well, but Joe is, well, kind of a tool. Good thing I bought lots of batteries.

      CD: Weezer, compilation CD  This is it, and yes, Jeff, I'm writing a weblog a day ahead again. Tomorrow I'm leaving for Europe for two weeks and I assuming I die on the way there you'll at least get to look at this and think I had some divine intuition about the whole think. It's been snowing for two days straight anyway, so maybe a plane crash isn't such a far-off idea. But if I'm going to go put myself at risk of death, I'm hoping it'll be while saving my fellow Americans from a crazed terrorist. I've already planned out that if there's a terrorist on board, I'm going to beat him up (to put it mildly). I'm gonna get all Delta Force on him. On the upside, I'll become a hero to America, and make everyone feel better about this great land of ours. On the downside, my friend Joe will probably be next to me on the plane, sleeping the whole time, and I'll have to explain to him the whole story about how I became an American hero while he snoozed AGAIN during a trip. Alas. So anyway, I'll try to write a trip journal and post it up here when I get back. You'll probably see some pictures as well; have a Happy New Year. (I'll be under the Eiffel Tower when the clock strikes 12:00.)  "This one's for the Constitution! This one's for freedom! And this one's for your friends!" --Me, during the dramatic scene from the future movie depicting me whacking the thwarted terrorist assailant unconscious with his own gun.

      CD: Jimi Hendrix, "Merry Christmas And Happy New Year"  I got a Game Boy! My brother is getting stranger all the time: first, he never has any money, second, he's the only person that bought anyone any Christmas presents this year. He must have collaborated with Dad or Santa Claus or Colin Powell or someone. These aren't cheapo gifts, either; we're talking a Game Boy for me, and a DVD player for Dad, etc., etc. Though I'm happy as h*ck to finally get that Game Boy Advance--I thought this day would never come! I can play Tetris anywhere!--I just had to ask my brother what was up. After watching so many Christmas specials in my life, and going to too many O. Henry plays, it couldn't be true, you know? "So Tim," I asked humbly, "tell me the truth: how long did you have to sell drugs to get all this stuff?" Tim just laughed. Which could mean anything... And Mom got a big candle!

      CD: Beatles, "Past Masters Volume 2"  Rock and roll! Tonight's Christmas Eve service was part revival, part talk show, part Osbournes. Our church is one of the ones with a Praise Band and a big computer projector that can broadcast PowerPoint. Combine this with some decent, practiced segwaying and a few hundred people with candles, and guess what: pyrotechnics. With each song, the lights went down or up depending on the mood. "Everybody get up and let's...!" started a number of songs. During the big finale, the great rock ballad "Silent Night" was sung along to with the Methodist equivalent of lighters. My brother, who avoids church depending on the decade, participated louder than everyone else, clapping louder, singing louder, getting really psyched. "Yeah!" he said to the family sitting in front of him as the lights came down. "Are you ready to rock?!" Ooh, and I love when they do the medley of hits from their Christmas album!  "I haven't been here in years! Whoa, that guy's old now!" --my brother

      CD: Grateful Dead, "Terrapin Station"  Nobody in my family is getting any other member of my family anything for Christmas. Finally, after years of half-hearted giving, we have given up. Well, almost. We may share a dinner or something. And though we don't even have a tree up, we have already watched more Christmas specials on TV this year. I am going to Europe the day after Christmas, so I promised to "bring back stuff;" these poor substitutes for Christmas presents will probably come in the form of mugs and trinkets like miniature Eiffel Towers or little pieces of cheese with the word "Geneva" on it. I dunno. But we told our father about the Greatest Gift of All--a new shower stall for the bathroom--that would suffice as an all-encompassing gift substitute. We went to Home Depot and looked around. So I guess what I really want for Christmas involves plumbing and grout. For some reason, there aren't many Christmas sales at Home Depot....

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "BBC Sessions"  There isn't much to do here. I've already spent like two hours on the internet, and I've played pinball on the off-hours. Remember "3-D Space Pinball" from your Windows 95 disk? It's still on Windows XP! What a great game. I got to something like six million points today, which is probably my third-best of all time, even when I was using it on Windows 98. It's so dead over here that I've started doing homework for next semester, and am about a hundred pages ahead so far. Mmm...Historical Research Methodology. Just saying it makes one feel envigorated. Besides that, well, I found some chocolate, and opened up a few letters. Three checks came in the mail, woohoo! I guess I could organize my "To Be Filed" file folder, or just go to bed and get that full six hours of sleep. Goodness, I have a pathetic life. Even on my time off work I find ways to suck life out of things. Hey, where'd I put my stampbook?

      CD: Mexican Cession, "Full Color Bitch Slap Attack"  Since school is out and the work has been slow, I've decided to do some spring cleaning early. No one helps. Nevertheless, I pick up other peoples' messes, some of which have been lying around for years. Last night's goal was to be the room just above the stairs, which has unofficially become "storage;" a.k.a. "there's no room to walk in that room." My problem with cleaning, however, is that I'm the worst person to do it. I get so allergic to flying particles of who-knows-what that I go through about fifty Kleenex in an afternoon. Last night, I went to that room above the stairs and turned on the lights. I immediately started hacking, sneezing, and swelling around the eyes. Dang. Twenty-four hours later and I want to jump back in the trenches. This is the part of the movie when one of my platoon buddies goes "But you'll never make it! It's a suicide mission!" and I'll say something in return, like "I've got to avenge my father's death" or something corny like that. Mmm, corn. Maybe I'll eat first; I'm hungry.

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  Son of a gun. I was going to write about Morning Hair. You know, when you wake up in the morning and your hair is about ten feet up to one side. Today mine was especially cool, as twelve hours of sleep pushed everything to the left side of my head, leaving a monstrous apex about two-thirds of the way over. It was magnificent. I had also gotten a haircut two days ago, so instead of a Rocky Mountain of hair it was more like an Appalachian Mountain of hair. It looked like a Mohawk, like the one Eddie Vedder has been sporting lately. But, NO! I can't write about my hair. Joe beat me to it! What with his new haircut and his Dave Grohl stylist and it's only a coincidence that I was listening to the Foo Fighters last night, it really was! Now no one will believe me; I'm just ripping of Joe's weblog. Son of a gun. Son of a gun.  "It used to be, we couldn't wear sunglasses during an interview; no, no, that would be so rude.

      CD: Meat Puppets, "Meat Puppets II" [enhanced rerelease]  Did you know I'm Spider-Man? Not even I knew my secret identity. During the course of the average day as a substitute teacher, I am inundated by numerous odd questions such as "Do we have to do this?", "Are you married/How old are you?", and my personal favorite, "Are you a REAL teacher?" But most of all, the kids love the fun of celebrity look-a-likes. Keanu Reeves I've heard before. Excellent. Recently I've also heard I look like Jim Carrey, and since Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey don't look anything alike I have no idea what's going through their developing minds. But last week I heard that I looked like Spider-Man. They later clarified that I look like Tobey Maguire, the guy that played Spider-Man in the movie. Whew. That makes much more sense than what I was thinking. "Hmm," I thought to myself, "The Tobey Maguire before he got bit in the lab, or after?" I think I already knew the answer.

      CD: BS 2000, "Simply Mortified"  I am astounded by the quality of parking at the American Automobile Association. Really. First, entering the lot is easy. It's right out in front, and the parking lot has several enterances and exits. The spots are very big, and the lot is also full of large trees making for an almost uncorrupted canopy. There are so many trees around the cars, in fact, that you can barely see the building. How wonderfully car-centric. I think it's good to see an organization that is so dedicated to their line of work...That is, compared to the American Legion, which has its own bar. Would AAA have a bar? I don't think so! I think they have better things to do. Anyway, they're high-class enough to serve champagne instead. Did the troops drink Budweiser as they attacked Pearl Harbor? I don't think so!

      CD: B.B. King and Eric Clapton, âRiding With The Kingâ  DIVINE INTERVENTION OF THE YEAR POST  Someone asked me to go to their church on Sunday night. I told them thank you for asking, but because of work I would miss a good part of the service. Also, I had a radio show that night at three in the morning; I couldnât do all three things. So I said Iâd visit another time when Iâm not working weekends anymore. Instead, I went home and set the alarm for 1 AM to get up and be a DJ. Meanwhile, while I slept the snowstorm moved in. They said itâd be something like six inches that night, but why think about something youâre going to miss most of?   So hereâs something people like me have to learn about snowstorms in Buffalo: there is an army of men and trucks that get rid of the snow, but they donât start until about four in the morning. People that want to be somewhere at three, shouldnât. After getting several inches of snow and freezing rain off my car I set out at 2 AM. Visibility was low and the roads were vacant of travelers. Somewhere outside of Millgrove on Genesee, I lost control of my car, slid to the left and rammed into someoneâs mailbox. I never did find the mailbox. Anyway, my car only suffered two small scratches and wasnât stuck, so I got back in the car and kept going. (I wondered, should I leave a note? And then I realized: where was I going to put it, in their mailbox?)  About three miles later on Genesee, a little past Ransom Road going towards Buffalo, my wheels got caught. I started skidding again, and this time spinning as well. As the scenery spun around I saw an oncoming truck, an awfully close, reinforced road sign (the kind with two metal posts, not one), then my own skid marks, and then the snowbank stopped me. I thought, âHuh.â The truck that saw it happen stopped, and he had a cell phone; I called my father to say I ran off the road, that Iâd probably be all right but that he might want to come down just in case. As the guy drove off I then I got out of the car to look at the damage. There was none. None. Underneath my back passenger tire, however...another mailbox. I propped it up against the reinforced road sign and pulled out my shovel.   I was able to dig myself out quite easily and it wasnât hard to decide I was going to turn around and go back homeâthe car was already pointed in that direction anyway, so the car decided for me. I waited half an hour for my father, then decided he was either going 22 miles an hour or got into an accident myself. Of course, one minute later he came down the road the opposite direction from me. And, of course, he didnât notice me. That meant I had to go follow him, hazard lights blinking and horn honking. I caught up to him and he still didnât notice me. Eventually I had to try and pass him in zero visibility to get his attention and make him turn around. I caught him another two or three miles down from where I hit the second mailbox. By now it was 4:30 in the morning, and the snow plows had passed by me, clearing my way home.   So in retrospect, hereâs what happened: I got in two accidents with little more than a scratch. The only other person on the road in twenty minutes just happened to see my last accident and also happened to have a phone the second I needed it. If I had spun off the road two seconds before I did, I would have hit a sign that could of done serious damage to my car; five seconds later, and I would have hit the truck that helped me. And when I finally got a hold of my dad to end my little adventure, where was I? Right across the street from the entrance to the LoveJoy Gospel Church, where I was asked to attend just hours before. Coincidence? And the CD that just happened to be in my rotation on the ride back? The one listed above: B.B. King and Eric Claptonâs âRiding With The King.â The King of Kings, folks; âtis the season!   F: âJerry?â J: âYeah.â F: âUm, Iâm here on Genesee. I, uh, Iâm off the road.â J:   âGREAT.â

      CD: Johnny Cash, "Orange Blossom Special"  Christmas is coming, and I've finally solved the great Christmas mystery. No, it's not where Baby Jesus was born, or how Santa gets down the chimney. I'm talking about socks. Every year myself and my siblings would get socks by the dozens, and by Christmas the next year, we would all be out of socks again! How does it happen? I found the answer. First, my siblings would never pick up their socks. I would, and throw them into a large box marked "clothes." Then, they would take MY socks, and I would vicariously put them in the "clothes" box. Each year I would fill a new box. This year, I opened all the boxes to see what I could give to Goodwill, and you know what I found? One pairs of danged socks, that's what! White ones, ribbed ones, elastic ones, white ones, reinforced toe ones, white ones, tubed ones, white ones, crew ones, and white ones. Ever sort one hundred pairs of socks! It's a rush! Whoo! Get back! Hurt myself!  "Dude, you look weird." --one longtime friend to another, after walking into a room

      CD: Eminem, "The Eminem Show"  I was watching Fox News, which I don't recommend, and "news" about Christmas at the White House came up. There was Mrs. Bush with bunch of kids near a tree, and the kids were asking questions about the White House, but mostly about how Santa gets in and out of the White House. She said there were a lot of big chimneys, or something like that; anyway, she said she really didn't know. And THEN the camera panned over and there was jolly ol' Saint Nick himself. So c'mon kids, just ask the man! You can do it! And come to think about it, if you were three or four years old, who would you want to talk to, Santa or the First Lady? Darn right! This was most definitely a photo op without common sense. Another way you could tell the whole thing was scripted was by the kids' questions. If you're in a room with 20 little kids and you ask them if they have any questions, fully eight of them will not know the definition of "question." One will try to tell a story about how they have a dog, and yesterday that dog was caught eating that night's meatloaf and their mom got mad and hit the dog with a newspaper and made it go outside. Then another kid will sit in the corner sucking their thumb. Within fifteen minutes, three will have to go to the bathroom, or will go without getting up. Someone will cry. But here at the White House? Every kid sits patiently, waiting for their turn to talk. Well, maybe they've been the really, REALLY Good Kids.   "F*** YOU LYNN CHENEY!

Once again, for another 2 hours, looking for those Windows 98 modem drivers my computer somehow "lost." Mind you, I'm trying to hook up an Ethernet connection with the thing, and why it needs modem drivers is apparantly not my business.  A nice walk to the bank to pick up my seventeen dollars! My, what brisk weather!  My laundry mission continues. I am washing every stray piece of clothes in the house; unclaimed articles will be devoted to the Salvation Army. I'm on my 15th load right now.  Called AAA about buying train tickets in the Netherlands. Surprisingly, they knew what I was talking about.  Reading about the mythical story of Murder Creek, kind of our local ghost story. Check it out at www.geocities.com/newstea...ciety.htm.  Thinkin' 'bout stuff.

      CD: Shel Silverstein, various mix CDs  I knew it would happen. Yesterday I wrote about attempting to clean my house despite the adversity posed by my allergies. Today I fought the law, and the law won. But I still succeeded! I cleaned that pesky room, or at least put everything in that room in a manageable place (empty closets are wonderful). Meanwhile, the entire time I was doing this I sneezed and dripped and lost more bodily fluids than I can remember ever intaking within the last two days. So I went to dinner suffering with a sporadic bloody nose; so what? What surprises me more is not the level of the inevitable but the discoveries uncovered. Like, I had no idea we kept enough styrofoam in that room to fill an oil drum. Or enough cardboard products to, well, fill up another oil drum. So I'd like to invite everyone over to an oil drum fire at my place. We'll be making s'mores, dude. You gotta come if there are s'mores!

      CD: Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, "Now I Got Worry"  Laptop computers are beautiful things. Today I slept for a full TWELVE hours today. The past few days I have either been writing papers all day, or getting up at ghastly pre-sun times to go to work, or this nasty pain in my back--no, not Al Gore--has kept me in a stationary position. Long story short, I wake up like an hour and a half ago but I'm still not OUT OF BED! I've checked my E-mails, read the news, listened to music, written letters, talked with friends, had a couple laughs, looked at a few message boards...and I haven't even sat up yet! Granted, when I finally DO sit up it will be extremely painful, but think of all the possibilities! I could be the next Howard Hugues! Heck, I could be the next--um, you know, that physicist guy in the wheelchair! Awesome! That physicist guy in the wheelchair was once on Star Trek!  "And after our perfect day, we could go to the movies, we could...get a hot dog....Have you ever had a hot dog, baby? With onions, and saurkraut?" --Jon Spencer Blues Explosion

      CD: Red Hot Chili Peppers, "Mother's Milk"  A couple of nights ago I bent down to get into my car (because I drive a Cavalier, gall dang!) and something in my neck went "crack." Not a loud, angry crack, like Marion Barry, but kind of a "crik." I might have said something like "huh" or a real small "ow" but I really wasn't worried. Then it hurt to raise my head. Then it hurt to move my head left and right. Then I had to roll over every time I wanted to stand up because if I didn't it would feel like someone had just jammed a sword down my spinal column. Though it's slowly wearing off, at its peak the entire top half of my back, my shoulders, my neck and head were incapable of moving anywhere without me going "a a a aaaahhhhHHHHHH!" "Ow." "Aw ahhhw ow!" and then I would gasp for air, though I still have no idea why, since I couldn't do anything less physical than lying prostrate on my bed.   "Sorry Fred, I Kid! I Kid! I Kid cause I love!" --Ed Snyder

      CD: Queens of the Stone Age, "Songs For the Deaf"  Nothing says "I'm an old man now" like getting up at 5:30 in the morning, putting on some dress clothes and going out to breakfast. Firstoff, I didn't even know restaurants were open that early. Second, where did all these people come from? They're older, of course (I went with my father), but even though they've still got to go to work right after they eat they aren't rushed, they take their time eating, they make conversation with the waitress, they read the paper real slow, they say hi to the other two or three people they know in the diner, they sip their coffee every minute or so and even have time for a few refills. Freaks! You can drink coffee while you drive, you know, and there's NPR if you want to stay informed. These people pretend like they have nothing to do! I wonder how they act after work, when there really IS nothing to do. All the relaxing stuff has already been done! Crazy.  "Hey, how's your drivetime commute? What's the SAGA. I need a saga! It's Songs for the Deaf. You can't even hear it!" --Queens of the Stone Age

      CD: Blur, "Parklife"  For shizzle my nizzle! So I was watching the show "Rock The House" on VH1 the other day, which is another cheesy attempt by the music industry to cash in on one of its twenty or so profitable acts... anyway, the idea behind the show is that a music star redecorates a fan's house without them knowing, and then the fan comes home and gets all shocked and stuff and then meets the artist and is all shocked and stuff and they love the house and they get a free Sony Flatscreen TV and everyone lives happily ever after. But Snoop...I'm worried about Snoop Dogg. He redecorated a girl's house, but during everything he did, he spoke with that "izzle" talk only he seems to use and understand. "I gotta mizzle my tizzle for shizzle cuz my heezy weezy! A Lizzle my nizzle!" Wuh? I used to think he might have learned this think during his stint in prison. Since phone conversations are taped in jail, I could he him and other prisoners using the "izzle" stuff so nothing they say could ever be used in court. But now i'm pretty sure he's making the crap up as he goes along. No one talks like that unless they're either too rich to care about reality or they're mentally retarded. Then again, Snoop did say he was giving up marijuana because it "makes you stupid." Yep.  He [Bush] recalled the last time he was in Florida, on the morning of Sept. 11, and what went through his mind when the first plane hit New York's World Trade Center: "I used to fly myself, and I said, 'Well, there's one terrible pilot.'" --Associated Press, Dec. 4, 2001

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  I give up. Since I started doing this weblog thing I've been putting the CD I'm listening to (or listened to that day) up on the top of each post. Well, at the beginning it was easy; in the summer I had time to listen to like five albums a day while I read, drove, or painted the trim on the house. With school starting, however, I narrowed it down to about 2-3 albums. Now it's final exam time, and I just don't have the energy. Not even the energy, it appears, to get up and change the CDs in my player. So if you analyse all of my posts from the start, you will see the first fifty days with fifty different CDs, then the next fifty with a few repeats (Natalie Imbruglia! Yay!) and now, well, it's like listening to my own personal version of KISS 98.5. Sorry, kids. But seriously, Sleater-Kinney made a kick-arse record this year. Dig!  "I have very mixed feelings about it. On one hand, Iâm concerned that the rampant downloading of my copyright-protected material over the Internet is severely eating into my album sales and having a decidedly adverse effect on my career. On the other hand, I can get all the Metallica songs I want for FREE! WOW!!!!!" --"Weird Al" Yankovich, on Napster   Edited by: TomServo0 at: 12/7/02 9:21:34 pm

      CD: Danko Jones, "Born A Lion"  It's coming! I bought me a brand new laptop--dude, it's a Dell!--online last week. Making the anticipation even tougher to deal with is that wonderful technological advancement known as the UPS Shipment Tracking system, which can tell me all the little stops my laptop is making on it's journey to my house. It's an adventure, just like on that show Belle and Sebastian! Remember, the cartoon about the little boy and his dog that took like 64 episodes to get home? Now my little laptop is in the UPS center in Buffalo (as of 10:40 PM last night) all alone, cold, shivering in the back of some brown, windowless truck. I hope it's doing alright. I wonder what it's thinking... Somewhere, out there/beneath the pale moonlight...  "Is it going to be about food?" --Kurt Cobain, when Weird "Al" Yankovich asked him if he could parody "Smells Like Teen Spirit"

      CD: Cee-Lo, "Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect Imperfections"  Over the past few years I would come home from breaks at school, and the house would be extremely messy. Of particular distress was the amount of peoples' clothes on the floor; sometimes washed, sometimes folded or in a hamper, but sometimes not, these clothes would be kicked around, tripped over, and otherwise unclaimed by anyone. And during each of my breaks I would pick up these clothes, put them in a large cardboard box, and tell everyone that if they didn't claim anything in the box it would go to Goodwill. Like I said, years have passed. There are now so many boxes of clothes that they take up a pile, ceiling-high, covering half of the laundry room. I am now in the process of washing all of these clothes. They will be sorted and put on tables, GAP-style, with signs proclaiming "CHRISTMAS CLEARANCE! EVERYTHING MUST GO!" In a psychological kuo, I'm think of charging rock-bottom, warehouse prices for these things I don't own. We'll see what happens.  "If the Good Lord strikes me down tonight, and I still haven't found my true love, I'm gonna die a happy man!" --a somewhat jaded Danko Jones

      CD: The Apples In Stereo, "Her Wallpaper Reverie"  Someone recently wrote in an inferior weblog (it was you, Joe!) that they could not decide was good music was anymore. Strangely enough, they asked me for advice. During college, my roommates warned other people that my taste in music was deplorable and probably, since I listened to anything I could get for cheap, nonexistent. The problem is compounded when a young adult, as the male psyche switches from preferring mindless, ear-shattering crap rock (your Limp Bizkits and Korns) to preferring mindless, sleep-inducing acoustic pop (your Travises and Dave Matthews Bands).   What is good music now? If it gets your attention and keeps it, that's a good start. Danko Jones is a good example of that; you can't get bored with it nomatter what you do. Outkast, Har Mar Superstar, Foo Fighters can usually do this. But also consider the work of The Neptunes, who have done work with Britney Spears, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Mystical, as well as their own N.E.R.D. project. Try them out. The Flaming Lips are also doing things that haven't been heard before.   Depending on your mood, maybe you shouldn't listen to music. Get into some older music; jazz like Count Basie, Horace Silver or Dick Hyman. Folk like Ledbelly or Memphis Minnie. The best thing you can do is to go to the public library and find the most obscure-looking, dust-encrusted albums they have. Sounds of the Ancient Incas, for example. Hungarian polkas. And then, if you still don't like music, play two records together and see what happens. My friend Dave and I found a great album that remixed traditional sounds of the culture of Mali with a broken melodica. Either way, stop looking for music and start listening to it....  www.amazon.com/exec/obido...24-4878443  "Hey, the McRib is back!" --Jack Osbourne

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  The shining moment of my Graduate school career thus far (other than the "Shaft" tribute on my radio show a few weeks ago) must be the thesis proposal handed in this Tuesday. Granted, it is probably not that good. It will probably just get a B because I handed it in on time (Education majors can't get lower than a B [I hope] as long as they pay their tuition bill on time). Why so proud of it, you ask? Well, I had all semester to write this twenty-page paper, and did not write a word until the day it was due. I got up at 6:00 AM (I was going to get up at 5 but you know how it is) sat down and churned out not twenty, but THIRTY-TWO pages of text in ten hours. How 'bout them apples? Eh? That includes a bibliography, people!   On a final note, I'd like to thank this weblog for teaching me how to pull words out of my nose at the last minute. And the Academy....

      CD: Dandy Warhols, "Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia"  Tonight the snow was so bad you couldn't see twenty feet in front of you. This happens every once in a while here in Buffalo. First, you hear a little something about some snow, then you kind of forget about and go about your daily business. In most other cities the grocery stores are packed with people trying to buy bottled water at this point. Buffalonians, however, are astute. They know that a steady diet of chicken wings, pizza and the occasional tailgater's feast insures that their body can go three, four days without nourishment. Being trapped in your house for half a week--which happens once a year now--is no problem as long as you have cable. But there was one strange thing I saw that grabbed my attention on the way home. Through the cloud of swirling snow I spotted a man running across the intersection of Main and Salt wearing nothing more than jogging shorts. No shirt, no shoes, no s***! It's 20 degrees outside and there's eight inches of snow! That must be one heck of a frat.  "...and I'm just about to kill someone if I don't buy that notebook!" --Guy who put me on hold, talking to himself

      CD: various, "OzzFest 2001 Summer Sampler"  Somehow, I'm going to give two important presentations and write two papers in four days. This doesn't mean that I've done any real prep work yet; yes, I do have all the materials on hand, but no, I haven't put one word down. I also have to work during those days, as well as a few other things including a heck of a long stay a Kinko's; we'll see how that works out. Thank goodness for 24-hour Kinko's! Who is Mr. Kinko anyway? What kind of name is Kinko? Is it anything like Chi-chi's? It was a sad day when they closed Chi-Chi's around here. I only went once, though, with my 7th Grade Home Economics class. Why, I don't know, but it involved free samples so I won't complain. Do you ever look back at your grade school field trips and wonder why you took them? I do, and I have no idea why I went to the zoo, museum, etc. Kind of like this post...I wrote it without knowing what today's "theme" would be, and now I'm done. And it even has a theme! Kinky!  âCorporation: An ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility.â --Ambrose Bierce

      CD: Portishead, "Portishead"  Credit cards are scary. Scarier are credit cards mixed with internet shopping. It's waaaay too easy. So I sit there in my pajamas, looking at my card, looking at the screen, looking at the price, looking back at my card, looking at the clock, checking my mail, looking back at the price, looking at the card again, looking at the button that says BUY IT! and thinking, "Aw man. This is too easy. This isn't right." I had to bring someone into the room and ask them if I should go through with it. "Yeah! Go for it!" they said. Somehow that made me feel worse, but I don't know why. "Free Shipping!" is tempting, yet that BUY IT! button reminds me of Stimpy's "History Eraser" button. Remember that one? The big, shiny, candy-colored button that just HAD to be pushed? It erased all of history, dude! That's freaky!  "Ding dongs, man! Ding dongs! Ding dongs, yo!" --video for Weird "Al" Yankovich's "Fat"

      CD: Cucumber + Ginseng, "El Presidente 2: Thology"  So Jeff and I were discussing the show "Inside the Actors Studio" and the part at the end where they ask the actor those Bernard Pivot Questionnaire. The last question is always: "If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?" I misread it and though it was "What would YOU say when..." But we both agreed that the least inspired answers came with this question. Always something cheesy and humorless. So he brainstormed the real question while I took the dead guy's point of view... Here's some of what I came up with.  Q. If Heaven exists, what would you say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?  "This is already better than the 'Taxes'."  "You mean I'm never going to see my wife again?"  "I seek the Grail."  "Hey! You're just James Earl Jones behind a curtain!"  "Will I have to live next to Italians?"  "Hell yeah, I'm in! Rock on! (makes devil horns with hand)"  "So the Jehovah's Witnesses knock on your door too, huh?"  "What's the meaning of li... oh, now I remember. Never mind."  "It smells like couscous up here."  "So you tell us to build our faith on a foundation of solid rock, but then you built the Kingdom of Heaven on this CLOUD?"    "Now look, sir. I may be just po' country folk, but I know that back in Kansas we got long hard days on the dirt farm, bland food, and boring children. But we're a community, gall-dungit. A good one, with good people. And no, God, it don't matter how much influence you may have got o'er the universe, or what power you have o'er life and death, or what any of your fancy "Commandments" say, you're not going to take a God-faring American man and his family from the farm they've worked for four generations to save and move them away to some 'Heaven' place just like that! Not today, not ever!"   So yeah, we were really bored tonight.

      CD: Cucumber + Ginseng, "El Presidente: Anthology"  The group Cucumber + Ginseng has rocked audiences around the world, but that is nothing compared to what they will do next. With the world at their oyster, record sales in the teens, and live shows that--literally--shocked their neighbors, C + G took an unpublicized long-term break from the music business. Dave "Dio" Hill has built a second cult following in his side band, "Tops Markets." Joe "Licks" Ferguson just performed at the world-famous Grand Old Opry in Nashville, only to be kicked out for being too "Rock  Roll." Frederick Charles Thomas "John Paul Jones" Schrock has taken up award-winning photography and hosts the popular game show "Name That Smell." Well guess what. The band has reunited with a new member, Tim "Novice" Schrock on drums, a new name, The Squeaky Divas, and a new mission: To rocK with a capital K. Because K is a really tough consonant.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Down On The Upside"  Right now I am looking at my Gorby Dolls. Actually I guess they would be called Yeltsin Dolls but I've wanted a set for a long, long, time. You know those Russian wooden people witht the people inside, and when you open up one you get a smaller one and a smaller one, et cetera? They also come in a "Leaders of Russia" set. You got your Yeltsin, Gorbachev, Brezhnev, Kruschev, (sp?) Stalin, Lenin, and I think that's Czar Nicholas II in the very center, or just maybe they made Karl Marx instead. It's not up-to-date--no Putin--but hey, i's got all the Communists I need! I got it in East Berlin anyway so I wasn't expecting full modernization of doll technology anyway. But here's the Catch-22: You can't fully enjoy them unless you take them out and display them simultaneously, but the only way to have real fun with them is to keep them inside the big one to play with them later! What's an American to do?

      CD: MC5, "Kick Out The Jams"  People still don't get it. After almost five days of barely speaking because of strep throat, people are still calling at me from opposite ends of the building and expecting to hear me yell something back. "WHO IS THE PHONE FOR?!" is probably the most frequent utterance. Well, I can write it down for you, or I could completely ignore you if the phone isn't for you. And since I'm running a fever and am really not in the mood to entertain such trivialities, I think I'll just lie here and let you keep yelling! In fact, what am I answering the phone for anyway, you lazy bum?! The best I can usually get out is a raspy, "Hall- -hallo?" These past few days of near silence has given me a greater appreciation for Actual Silence; maybe by the end of the week I will discover it, too.

      CD: Queens Of The Stone Age, âSongs For The Deafâ  I took 26 rolls of film in Europe. About 8 pictures came out well. First, I turned them into the good, unpaid and ununionized folks at Wal-Mart, which required that I fill out 26 of those Photo Envelope things. I told the girl Iâd be back in âabout an hourâ which is AN IRONIC TWIST OF FATE completely lost on her. Then she said theyâd be ready by Saturday, which they werenât. So I came back Saturday and they said âThat girl CRAY-zee, theyâll be ready on Monday,â which they werenât. Then I came on Tuesday and yes, they would be ready, but not for two hours. What to do? I looked at the (censored) CD section. I ended up buying a Game Boy game and being quite upset at myself for âwasting my money.â I then bought a Veggietales DVD, and by then my good sense nearly walked. Ninety more minutes. I decided to take a walk outside. I checked out the dollar store and thenâooh!âa discount shoe store. I bought me some sneakers for the first time in 2 Â½ years and somehow felt like I accomplished something. One of the most fun ways to spend an hour and a half is âtrying outâ new shoes, skipping and jumping up and down and basically doing the mating dance of the dodo bird in a back aisle near the storeroom while playing with new toys like shoehorns and ankle stockings. By the way, developing 26 rolls of film costs about $200, give or take a dollar. Just enough left for a set of 20 pencils at the Dollar Tree next door.

      CD: Radiohead, âAmnesiacâ  Iâm quite proud of the fact that I skipped the Super Bowl for the first time since 1988. Maybe if I stop watching it altogether, the teams I want to win will actually do soâ¦Nobody talks about the game the next day anyway; they only want to talk about the commercials. But since I didnât watch the Super Bowl, here are some other commercials I like (see how Iâm scraping for blog subjects?):  -âWHEREâS THE BEEF?!â Still the best.  -The one where the guy is sniffling, sneezing, headache, cough, etc. That guy looks like crap.  -The Hose Roller thing where the âOther Guyâ keeps fumbling with his hose, eventually dropping it, whereas the lady next to him has that Hose Roller thing and can do it with one hand. Note how the guy also has an untucked shirt and ratty hair. He just canât keep ANYTHING together!  -I miss the Pets.com dog.  -You know, the one where the mother in the family is all happy to be doing the laundry or the dishes or making breakfast that no one has time to sit down and eat? But thank goodness she spent X dollars on the brand name version of X that somehow makes banal chores like cleaning up after, feeding, and washing her family (something they should really learn how to do by themselves) just plain magical. Remember that one? As magical as dancing stuffed teddy bears, floors with animated bald men looking at you through their shine, or flying cereal bowls that metamorphose into granola bars mid-flight. Hey mom, whatever keeps you off the Vicadin.   -Sign up for the Army, get a free pair of socks!

      CD: Beastie Boys, âCheck Your Headâ  School has only been going on for a week but Iâve already noticed some trends. In one class, the professor felt it necessary to warn us about the courseload; he wants us to know as soon as possible that readings of up to 75 pages per week will be assigned. Gee, I know this is Grad School, but why is he demanding so much of us? Seventy-five pages might take over an HOUR to read!! In another class, I told the teacher in her office that I had Strep Throat and probably should meet her at another time (itâs an Independent Study Course) and then noticed she had been smoking and drinking coffee for the past hour and had a hoarser voice than me. I didnât feel so bad then. A third teacher was impressed that I was the only one who had taken the cellophane off the textbook. I told him Chapter 9 looked pretty interesting, to which he replied âOh yes, thatâs written by a very good author.â Nobody else in the room knew that he was the authorâ¦ Ummâ¦ there was one more class. AH HA! The guy with the accent. Very bright and entertaining, but he writes with his left hand like itâs his left hand, yâknow? The text slopes upward at about a 55 degree angle. Itâs a Arab studies course, so Iâm assuming that writing English for him really IS writing backwards. And that wuz me furst wik at skool.

I donât think half those buildings are more than twenty years old. Not to mention their parliament building has only been in use since 1999. And as for terrorism, I think the Germans know darn well what a terrorist regime is! Dang! Who hired this guy? And isnât this the wiener we have a picture of shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s? EWW. Those are cooties of the highest order! Did you wash your hands, Donald?

      CD: Outkast, âStankoniaâ  Today I went to the doctor and for the first time in over five years I didnât have to take off my pants! Whoo-hoo! Itâs about time, cuz that lady must be bored of me by now. (That poor receptionistâ¦  Just kidding.) For some reason my REAL doctor is either too busy to see me or Iâm just not bleeding enough for him to be interested, so they send me to the nurse practitioner. Last year I busted up my knee, and had to take off my pants for her to look at it. She had some weird system where she gave me one of those paper blanket things to put on my lap, but she also needed me to lift my leg and twist it aroundâ¦it was inevitable that she see my underwear. But hey--Iâm an adult, youâre a doctorâand theyâre boxers! Not a problem! Before that, I came in for my college physical, and, well Iâll leave the details of that to myself. So it was really great that I could walk into that room and hear âFred, nice to see you!â instead of the regular âDrop âem.â Or whatever the medical term is.

Some weird throat infection has taken control and all I can mutter out is a painful cough once in a while. Ironically, once you get a throat infection you have to do more talking. You have to explain to people you meet that you canât talk because of your throat infection. You have to call in to work and explain to them that you canât go in today because of your throat infection. You have to call the doctor and tell the receptionist that you have a throat infection and you need to set up an appointment. Your friends call and want to know what youâre up to and you strain to tell them that youâre doing nothing because you have a throat infection and you canât do anything later. And, of course, there are the jerks that keep asking you, âHey, is your throat feeling any better?â from the other side of the apartment and expect you to yell back âNo, I still canât talk!â at the top of your lungs. I gotta go make some calls now.

      CD: The Strokes, âThis Is Itâ  There is a house on Main Street that was abandoned a few years ago. It was pretty downtrodden and finally the property was soldâso I hearâto put up a new Dunkinâ Donuts (YES!). So the building was torn down last fall. Its remains sit there still, covered in several inches of snow. Apparently, but not shockingly, thatâs illegal. The big bad town of Newstead is trying to bring the owners to task for getting rid of the debris. The weekly Akron Bugle seems confused, however. Sure, whatâs left still legally a âbuilding,â but itâs like they donât know that WE know itâs really a pile. This weekâs paper reiterates that âOwners of the property will have an opportunity to appear in person and provide evidence that the property is not in violation of the provisions of the Unsafe Building Law during the hearing.â Good luck, guys! It also outlines what the Unsafe Building Law STATES, like we need to know that? I was originally going to list all 12 possible violations of this âbuilding,â but come on. There is no building. The walls and roof are parallel to each other. If you wanted to vacuum the carpet youâd have to rent a forklift. To light a fire in the chimney, you would use the master bedroom as kindling. This is a Late Parrot!

      CD: Presidents Of The United States Of America, âPure Frostingâ  I am âteachingâ a study hall right now. There is this one kidâwhere did he go? Oh, there he isâthat just keeps staring at the computers longingly, as if at a picture of a long-lost lover. See, he spent the first ten minutes of the period typing OYOYOYOYOYOYOYOYOYOY into the computer and turning on the computer voice to read it to the class. So we kicked him off. When it comes to computers in school, kids donât think to themselves, âYay, research!â Itâs more like, âDarrr, com-pyoo-trz r fun!â and their brains stop. Computers are an excuse to NOT do work; four years in a wired dorm has taught me that lesson well. Now he sits in the back muttering âNow Iâm so borrrrrrrrred.â Aw.

      CD: Radiohead, âI Might Be Wrong: Live Recordingsâ  The dentist is all proud of me and stuff. I hadnât been there sinceâlemme thinkâAugust 13, 1996, but man, he took one look at my pearlies and was like âWow, youâve really kept up your teeth; whatâs your secret?â Well, Dr. Dentist, itâs ancient and Chinese. Actually, itâs because I didnât follow doctorâs orders. Once he told me that it looked like I had weak gums and should switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush. Then I did, and when I went back he said the exact same thing. Forget that! So last year I decided to go for it and bought myself a MEDIUM strength brush. I bleed every once in a while, but itâs worth it! Thatâs my secret: I donât go to the dentist and I donât listen to a word he says!

      CD: Bikini Kill, "The C.D. Version of the First Two Records"  Today I spent 2-3 hours with the good folks at Dell trying to figure out why my laptop has suddenly gained the ability to disable every telephone in my house. Somehow, whenever I plug a cord into my modem our number loses its ringtone. Now I have to wait a week to get a new modem sent to me. It also means that I will be subjected to sitting up when I use the Internet, an act that, once you're given the option of lying down and take it, is something you hate to go back to. Therefore, since I am lazy and have also just written ten pages on what I did on my winter vacation, This is a perfect excuse for me to stop doing daily blah blah blogs for a while; about a week to be exact (I hope) before I get the computer fixed. I will also take this chance to officially retire the Daily Quote because it just makes this post thing that much harder to write. I'm still surprised people read this stuff, anyway! Maybe I'll try some new things this year, like rhyming what I right, if I can get my timing right. But if the Dell folks spoke correctly, I'll go right back to my writing directly.

      BERLIN   So what I remember learning today is that the Germans are really, really, really sorry about that whole Holocaust/World War II thing. They canât apologize for that enough. One large city block is cleared to be a memorial for all murdered Jews. Just flat land. Very depressing. Ate a Berliner (a jelly doughnut, not a citizen) and it was okay; Ed Jr. wanted to stop at a Dunkin Donuts for breakfast which really says ânative foods,â donât you think? What else do I remember? Well, theyâre still cleaning up from the war. There are still bombed-out buildings hanging out, especially in the East. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum is filled mostly with old warning signs that told all the Germans that their country was split in half. They all start with âAchtung!â and then they say something like âDo not cross the river under penalty of deathâ or âHave proper identification readyâ or âIâve fallen and I canât get up.â You know, stuff that people would yell under stress if they had to. In East Berlin I bought me one of those wooden Russian dolls that you can open up and find a smaller doll inside. Neat! I always wanted one of those! This one is of Soviet leaders, from Yeltsin all the way down to Lenin and I think Karl Marx, but itâs too small to tell. So far my impressions of German folks are good. Their trains run right on time, which means theyâre just like Buffaloâs subway except it works and it takes you somewhere. At the Reichstag (German Parliament building), the placards try to make abundantly clear that âThe sham government of the Third Reich never held session inside our government headquarters.â Itâs like Okay, guys, weâve all moved on now! But everyone remembers when the Berlin Wall fell, and thereâs a line through the city marking where it was. Itâs an odd photo opp, especially as you try to take pictures of it in a busy intersection. Maybe itâs their way of getting the last Americans out of the country.        AMSTERDAM   You know, if you donât smoke pot, like hookers, or own a bicycle, Amsterdamâs probably not for you. But we tolerated it for a few days. The first thing I remember is the bike garage, which must have had something like 7000 of the things on three levels. What I want to know is, how do these people get from their house to the bike garage? Anyway, I had the pannekoken. Thereâs the Beastie Boys lyric that says âWhen Iâm in Holland, I eat the pannekoken,â and I always thought that referred (no pun intended) to marijuana. How foolish of meâtheyâre pancakes. And you roll weed in them. Iâm just kidding. But speaking of drugs, we were walking down the street when Joe just kind of blurts out âHey, as long as weâre here, why donât we buy some crack?â Two seconds later, a guy walks up to Joe and asks him, âYouâre looking for crack?â âNo, I was only kidding.â âAre you sure?â âI WAS MAKING A JOKE.â He was very nice for a drug dealer, though. I actually felt bad for Joe because he really wanted to go to the Van Gogh museum but we didnât have the time. We did make the time for the Anne Frank House, however, and it was a total waste. So these people hid in the attic, right? And fifty years later, someone thinks âHey, I can make some money off of this,â puts up a couple of guardrails and wham, charges people like $6.50 to look at an empty attic. Whoo. And it brings in people by the droves; they line up down the street to see Anne Frankâs wallpaper. What else? You canât take pictures in the Red Light District, but for the most part you probably donât want to. And because property taxes used to be based on how much ground your house covered, all the buildings are really thin and high (in altitude, not under the influence). In order to get furniture upstairs they use a rope-and-pulley system outside, and so the furniture doesnât hit the wall on the way up the building actually comes out towards the street as it goes up. So every building looks like itâs going to fall on you. That really makes me fell bad for the people walking around on mushroomsâ¦dude.       PARIS   Paris on New Yearâs Eve is nothing like Dick Clark does. First and most disappointing, thereâs no big clock. People just sort of collectively decide when it turns into the next year, so it is midnight from about 11:30 to 12:30 in the morning. Second, the use of such explosives in New York City would probably get you deported. Paris doesnât have a fireworks display, but the Parisian citizens compensate by bringing whatever sparklers, M-80s, rockets, or scud missiles theyâve been storing up for the last twelve months. And Iâm only kidding about the scud missiles. Under the Eiffel Tower is Ground Zero, and anyone down there has to prepare to dodge everything thrown at themâpurposely. We tried to stay away from the action but there were a bunch of kidsâJoe and Ed refer to them as Arab terrorists (?) âthat would run up to you, light a firecracker in your face, yell âBonne Annee!â and throw them at you. We did a lot more running that night than we expected to. While trying to leave the area at 12:30, the major road was filled with cars that were scattered in fifty different anglesâthere was no use driving, the moronsâand drunken revelers danced in between the four lanes of one-way traffic, personal champagne bottles in hand, jumping on car hoods and chasing after random girls to, well, French them. The French really arenât as rude as people sayâ¦wait, yes they are. And I completely forgot that they closed the subway there at 1 AM meaning that 3 million people in the street had to walk home in the cold. THATâS rude. Especially when the riot police is yelling at you to get back while he closes the metal gate to the station right in front of you. ESPECIALLY when your hotel room is like ten kilometers out of town and you end up walking for the next four hours in the cold. Speaking of subway stops, the ones near the hotel happened to be open, where we found two Anglophone girls about our age trying to find their way to Nation station, meaning they were too drunk, stupid, or both to notice they passed that stop twenty minutes before they actually got off the train. One said they were from âVancouver,â the other from âTexas.â Yeah, right. You sound like youâre from Michigan State. Anyway, they asked what we thought of New Yearâs in Paris and Joe says something like âIt was one of the most awesome experiences Iâve ever had,â to which Texas girl says, âIâve partied harder.â So I feel bad for her, since she could have had a much more exciting time in her Michigan State dorm drinking a 24-pack of Budweiser in front the strobe light she bought at Spencerâs, instead of blowing all her parentsâ money on a trip to Europe to get the same effect. The next morning we slept until 1:30, mostly because we needed that five hours of sleep to keep alive. Rockin'.        GENEVA   Switzerland is the only place where we had to exchange our money, from the universally accepted Euros to the lesser known Swiss Francs. Darned Swiss. You know they just joined the UN last year? In their attempt to be completely unbiased and peaceful, theyâve stayed out of the EU. That means one Euro is work like 1.34 Swiss Francs, or some weird computation thatâs like measuring time in quarts. Our impression of Switzerland is very good, however, even though the city was on holiday that night and virtually empty. After all, they do have the UN there, and the Red Cross, so they must be decent folks. The Francophones there are polite, and every where you go sells Swiss Army Knives and Toblerones. We went to the church Martin Luther preached at after he was kicked out of GermanyâI think thatâs what happenedâbut it was closed. So we went to dinner at Movenpick because it was the only thing open and we sat next to an old lady that spent about an hour and a half picking at her $20 dinner (about 34n3.Q Swiss Francs) until she happily asked for her check. Like she was making a sand castle or something. We found a few statues in around the UN-Red Cross area that looked pretty odd so I made Ed and Joe stand next to them and imitate them while I took incriminating photos. I hope those came out. Did I mention Geneva is in the middle of the Alps? I donât know how we did it, but we walked uphill the entire day. Even when we were backtracking. Strangely, we never saw the Swiss Army, that is until we got to Romeâ¦.        ROME   Rome is nuts. Iâm a history major, and I almost went into shock. There are so many historical thingamabobs, or monument whatchamajiggers to commemorate the historical thingamabobs, that we eventually stopped walking around for fear that weâd find more stuff to look at. I wore a light brown, cordoroyish shirt with large breastpockets, where I put my oft-used camera and my daily allowance of five rolls of film. I went trigger-happy for two full days and Ed started calling me Generalissimo Photog, which kind of stuck. We had a tour book that said one of the hostels was called âFawlty Towers,â coincidentally just like the old British sitcom. Then I found out it was actually based on the British sitcom, so it was even funnier. Then I found out thatâs where Ed made our reservations and it was like winning $5 in the lottery! Sweet! The Roman subway has less stops, more people, less seats, more graffiti, less reliability and more sudden brakings than the one in New York City. Rome has the Pinto of subways. Still, whenever you get off, thereâs tons of cool stuff! We went exploring around the Coliseum and found a 16th century chapel that was just covered in murals and other interesting artistic endeavors. We found the archaeological remains of a pagan temple and the Circus Maximus within a couple minutes walk. One of the best things was outside the cityâthe catacombsâand I was happy to have dragged Ed and Joe to it. I donât feel bad about getting off at the wrong bus stop, or making them walk down a rural road with no shoulder while little Italian cars missed them by inches going about 70 miles an hour, because we got there, right? Itâs weird finding a cave that second century Popes were buried in. A Spanish lady who spoke decent English told our Italian tour guide that we should pray and that made all the opened graves seem a bit more homey. Still, the tour guide told us that she once took a group of British folks down there and she hasnât found them yet. Nuts, I tells ya!        VATICAN CITY   The Vatican is the shiznit. Word. It is the smallest country in the world, but per square mile it is ten times cooler than anything else out there. Even better then Luxembourg. The Vatican is also where I was the least able to get along with, and Generalissimo Photog should apologize to his comrades for acting like a military sergeant as I tried to make time for everything. First off, the country is protected by the Swiss Guard; how cool is that? And you wonder, if the Swiss never fight, are they good? Then again maybe the Catholics hired them because they DONâT want them to fight. Either way theyâre armed with axes. Yeah. We took the elevator to the top of St. Peterâs Basilicaâ¦well, not exactly the top. That takes you to the rim of the dome, probably the most impressive sight of the entire trip. Itâs crazy stepping into that doorway and realizing youâre ten stories up and there is a 300-foot chasm right in front of you. And that chasm, and the dome over it, is covered in gold, mosaics, and Who knows what else. The extra 330 steps to the very top were almost as interesting, as you had to walk up stairs sideways as you went up the side of the dome. I could talk all day about this place. In the Vatican museum, Joe had to walk against traffic for 20 minutes to get back into the Sistine Chapel because he didnât know âthe picture with the two guys almost touchingâ was in there and he had to see it before we left. There were wall paintings and carvings at every step. Even if the museum were empty itâd be a great museum. And what supposedly remains of St. Peter is underneath the Basilica, in itâs own special room with golden everything and diamond encrusted stuff that nobody can look at except through a window. Iâd like to spend another week in the Vatican, just snooping around, trying to sneak into the Popeâs basement, but the Swiss Guards would probably hack me to death. The next time I go Iâm going to bring a bunch of postcards with Martin Luther on them, just so I can get them stamped with the Vatican postmark.        AUSTRIA   After two very long days in Rome, it was actually nice to get stuck in a stuffy train car overnight. On the way down from Rome we were put in a sleeper with this Italian guy and his snoring, four-year old son, and some girl named Ja Young, who didnât say a word the entire time but had a stuffed koala bear attached to her backpack next to the name tag that said âKorea.â Nice people, but too many for a 6 by 6 by 8 cell. So this time Ed tried to make sure no one got in the cabin. He had us shut the door, close the curtains, turn out the lights, and stretch waaaaay out over the seats so it looked like there was no room. But first we had to get rid of three guys from Senegal, or some other country. Their language sounded like a mix of Spanish, French, Swahili (though Iâve never heard Swahili and donât really know what Iâm talking about) and Mooklar, a language I just invented. But they seemed very nice. One they left we put our plan into action and took over the cabin. We slept head to head to head, just like the Beastie Boysâ âHello Nastyâ cover, and talked girl talk all night. At about six or seven in the morning an Austrian border guardâthe real freaking militaryâthrew open the door and yelled âPASSPORTS!â Joe and Ed didnât wake up fast enough to notice, but he was smiling the whole time. It must have been really funny watching Larry, Moe, and Curly fly around leap up from a pile of coats and luggage like startled moles. Bumping into each other for no reason other than we were still dreaming, Joe gave him his ticket, or the first piece of paper he could find, to which the border guard yelled at him again until he figured it out. I had mine but he barely looked at the thing; his smile just got BIGGER. Then he yelled âTHANK YOU!â and we never saw him again. So thatâs what I remember about our 45 minutes in Austria.        MUNICH   MunichÂ¡Â¦s a good, hearty town. I think it was Sunday that day, so everything was closed again. We got there about eight or nine in the morning and Ed knew of a nice pub that we could go visit, and since Joe and I didnÂ¡Â¦t know where we were going (a normal occurrence) we just followed him. The pub makes its own beer, is about five hundred years old and prefers natives to tourists. We forced Joe to drink a liter of beer for breakfast, and Ed already posted about that; itÂ¡Â¦s as funny as it sounds. ÆÂº A great part about this tavern was that certain tables had a coat of arms hanging over it. We found out that certain groups of local men claim these tables, and no one else is allowed to sit there. Ever. Their own special beer mugs are kept locked away for when they come. And there a group of them was, 10 AM on a Sunday morning, preparing for a long day of drinking beer. One guy even had a drinking glove so as not to get repetitive stress injuries in his hand. ThatÂ¡Â¦s Messed Up. There was a band and everyone was having a pretty good time, but we had to go, especially Joe, who had to pee like nobodyÂ¡Â¦s business. Outside at noon we watched the town clock go off, especially interesting because itÂ¡Â¦s one of those old ones with little people in them that dance around every hour. About fifty people came out to watch it, and it was interesting for a full two minutes; good thing we ran out there in the blistering cold to go see THAT. I canÂ¡Â¦t really remember anything else about Munich; Joe was drunk enough for all of us. Now where did we go next?       COLOGNE   Ed really hyped up the cathedral in Cologne, Germany (which is Koln, Deutchland to the natives). âYou really have to see it, Fred.â âItâs really cool, itâs the biggest Gothic cathedral in the world.â Blah blah blah. So one day we step out of the train station and Boom, there it is. This 700+ foot church is standing right in front of us. Big, black, pointed, covered in gargoyles. Itâs so big it blocks out the sun. And we just stand there, staring at it. âHoly CRAP.â And nobody says anything for like three minutes. Then Ed says, âYeah, the first time we saw it we were like âholy crapâ too.â Ed and I came back a couple days later and I was still like âHoly CRAPâ for a full day. I just kept repeating, âItâs so BIG!â But inside was sweet. Imagine a building like that full of mosaic floors with stones no bigger than your pinkie fingernail. The thing took 600 years to build! They also just opened a museum in the basement with some funky relics, like some cattle brandings from the 17th century thatâs supposed to cure Mad Cow Disease. Wuh? The rest of the city was pretty nice as well; there are hardly any cars downtown because like most cities in Europe, the streets are too small for âem. They tried the same thing in America: they call them shopping malls and since theyâre away from population centers the parking lots and highways needed take away the convenience they supposedly make. Ed and I went to a store called Media Markt, kind of a Circuit City. Over there they still have a âBlack Musicâ section for CDs. That really isnât a big a problem as Ed and I going CD shopping, because we both have serious problems in that category. I think we got like 12 CDs total and then went to Pizza Hut. Ed has been hankering for American food the whole tripâhe forced his parents to go to Dunkin Donuts in Berlin for breakfastâso I let him succumb to his urges for once. I took the plunge and had the pizza with pineapple on it, because I figured, hey, yesterday I had pizza with tuna fish on the top; how could this be any worse? I came out of there a convert. Bathrooms cost no matter where you go, and I paid the attendant double because I just felt bad. What else happened in Koln? Well, it was settled around 60 AD by the Romans, but that doesnât have much to do with my trip.        AACHEN   Aachen always reminds me of the Castle Aaaaaaaaagh mentioned in âMonty Python and the Holy Grail.â Itâs almost as historical! Here we saw remnants of an old Roman watchtower (still in use), and the church that Charlemagne used to control the Holy Roman Empire from. Thereâs a bust of Charlemagne in there that actually contains his real skull; Ed found out that whenever a new king took power they would bring out Charlemagneâs head to welcome him. Geez. There was some other story about how the church was bombed during World War II but the late Charlemagneâs Magical Powers deflected everything off the roof. Instead, the bombs all hit the church next door! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ahem. I took pictures of quaint streets and old stones while Ed bought postcards. After all, if you take a bunch of pictures, why buy postcards, and if you buy a lot of postcards, why use a lot of film? We dropped off Joe a day or two before, and realized that our conversations focused more on history, school, and big words compared to when Joe was with us. By the end of the trip, a good 80% of what Joe said involved the word âBork!â Remember the Swedish Chef from âThe Muppet Show,â and nobody knew what he was talking about? In Europe, it was like we were meeting 1000 new Swedish Chefs every day, and we imitated them often through our brash American ignorance. France: âQuâest-ce que le bork bork?â Germany: âBorken ze bork?â Italy: âBorka borka! Thatâs-a spicy-a meatball.â Ah, Aachen.        BRUSSELS   Brussels was cold. Hot d*ng, it was cold. You know how cold it is outside now? It was COLDER there. Ed normally prefers walking to the subwayâWhat better way to see the sights?âbut we gave up quickly because we were turning blue. So anyway, we kept going into a bunch of churches for no real reason other than they looked neatâ¦and because we were COLD and trying to stay warm! The only thing colder than the weather was the reception we got at the Court of Justice, a really great building where, apparently, some serious shizzy was going down. In Flemish, âshizzyâ means depositions, asylum requests, and other international Serious Business. We scrammed without taking pictures because we were afraid of getting arrested. Earlier that day we had the totally required Belgian Waffles and some chocolate (good!) and made our vacation compete visiting the Mannekin Pis. At the waffle place we realized that all the nice French people left France, for several reasons:  1.) The store was closed, but they let us in and took our order  2.) When we left a tip, they got all upset and tried to tell us in French that we paid them too much!  3.) A fellow American touristâs credit card didnât work and she âhad no moneyâ (sounds dubious) and was allowed to come back later when she found a cash machine  4.) They were awesome waffles!  We also went to the new EU complex, where we found a Tourist Information center with more free stuff than I could carry. So I made Ed carry it for me! Ooh, what else? BRUPARCK! A leftover from a Worldâs Fair of old, BRUPARCK! has the greatest movie cineplex in the work, a 300-foot tall model of an atom, and fish and chips (good!) for only 7 euros 50.       FRANKFURT   I went to the airport in Duesseldorf to fly home, but not only did the flight get canceled, United Airlines declared bankruptcy and by the time I got there the company had packed up and left. Somehow I ended up in Frankfurt. Frankfurtâs airport has about 400 front desks, and thatâs not an exaggeration. I donât remember how I got home. I mean, I took a plane, but other than that Iâm pretty clueless. All I remember is having a cold, running about a mile down a hallway, and having about ten security guards get friendly with me in the course of seven minutes. I played a lot of Game Boy on the plane and tried not to throw up. And thatâs the end of my trip! Thank goodness, because Iâve written ten pages about it and I donât want to write any more. Time for a nap. Bonne annee!

      CD: various, "All Areas Volume 35"  Hey, folks. I decided to skip out of the country for a couple weeks, so, Jiminy, I'm really behind on my posts. So the first posts will be about my trip to Europe, done on a per city basis. I also have an aborted trip log that lasted two full days (don't laugh, it lasted longer than the "running schedule" I instituted last summer). But I'm stuck in the house with a cold and I'm determined to make up the sixteen days I missed. Including this post: Happy New Year! 2003 is shaping up to be a real humdinger of a twelve month cycle. Speaking of which, a more accurate calendar would have thirteen 28 day periods based on the cycle of the moon, which was the intent in the first place. The problem was that 13 is an unlucky number, so they cut it down to twelve and made sure Black History Month got the short end of the deal. So what should the thirteenth month be called? Here are some suggestions, in brainstorming order:  -Bush! -Rocktober -Winslow -Lavigne -Bork Bork Bork! -Shibby -Stern Rules! -Friday -Dick Hertz -The Extra Month, brought to you by Pringles New Sour Cream and Onion Chips. Pringles: Once You Pop, You Can't Stop! -Month of the Llama -Grunge -Danko -H (the H is silent) -Atari -Hammertime  That's enough of that. Finally, the quote of the year so far:  Margaret: "You smell!" Jerry: "What do I smell like?" Margaret: "Like the inside of a turtle!"

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CD: Robert Plant  Jimmy Page, "No Quarter"  Umm....The idea for this post was that I would go to www.aljazeera.net, get an article in Arabic, and post it here for people to look at and go "wUH?" It worked in Microsoft Word, and I was hopeful. The spellchecker even pointed out a couple errors, which I thought was interesting. It even posted well, but after pressing enter it came out all goofy-like. Well here you go anyway...note the number "1441" which kind of points out what it was talking about.

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Blonde on Blonde"  "I went to kennel and I got to work with the cats, finally! I have been in the dog room for the past 3 times. So anyway, all of the cats were good, and very cute. I didn't enjoy being totally covered inside (I swallowed and breathed some in...haha) and out by cat hair though. We did TPR's on all of them just like we do for the dogs. We also had to pill them...1/2 a tab of 250mg Lidocane...they didn't like that too much, but they were good anyway. Then all of us did the usual stuff, clean out their cages, sweep and mop the cat room, and feed them.  "So after I left kennel I went to the cafeteria. I decided to get a coffee, grapefruit and a chocolate chip muffin (b/c I am PMSing). When I went and sat down and went to eat the muffin, I was amazed that it was still warm! And it was fresh! The chocolate chips were all melty...my favorite! I was sssssoooooo impressed, I called my Mom on her cell phone to tell her about it...she was like...WOW! Haha! So yeah this was one part of my good day...the best part by far! Then when I went to Microbiology, I actually didn't fall asleep like I normally do! It was amazing! Then when we took our quizzes on fungi (molds and yeast) my prof. let us all work in pairs when she saw that no one knew any of the answers to her questions! It was kewl.  "This guy Joe (CarlWinzlow) that I went to college with keeps hitting on me lately. What is his deal? His he serious? Maybe he is...but I just told him that he just wants a piece of ***. He admitted to that part but wouldn't elaborate about anything else...eerr. Well if he is serious I know that he is a nice guy and that he wouldn't hurt me so we'll see. And Joe, if you are reading this...what the **** is up with you lately? FrEaKo..."

      CD: Red Hot Chili Peppers, "By The Way"  I just ate a two-foot sub. Two feet! That's like eating a midget for dinner! So I am naturally very full. I can't move so well and I'm really, reallly tired. There is also an overwhelming urge to drink water. Strange, because I'm full, but I'm thirsty? Is that possible? I thought there was no more room down there. The only reason I'm online now is because I can use my laptop while laying down and I can't do much else. Why is it so tiring, like I just did some exercise? I can just see me in a gym right now. The sweaty guy next to me will say "I just benched 350 for the first time" and I will say "Yeah, but I just ate a two-foot sub." And he will look at me in awe and say "Dude, you must have been training hard." "Cuz two foot subs are nothing to laugh at. And they're dangerous if you don't use a spotter!

      CD: Ben Folds, "Rockin' The Suburbs"  The cops called me up recently. The sheriff's deputy told me that he's been trying to get a hold of me for weeks. A couple of months ago I hit a mailbox at 3 AM in a snowstorm and not only did I leave the scene of the accident--I didn't know it was a crime if you don't hit something living!--they found my front license plate in the snow--I didn't know it was gone--so now I've apparently been on the lamb since Christmas. Even worse, I left the country during this time. I apologized to the policeman and I told him I was sorry he couldn't get to me earlier since I was in Europe. Then he says "You were in Rome? Did you see the Fountain of Trevi?" "Yeah I was..." "Did you go to that nightclub across the street?" What the heck? So the cop's a good guy and he says he doesn't want to waste time arresting me, which is also good. So next time in Rome....

      CD: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass"  I didn't really feel like going out the other night so I told my friends to just go along without me and "get drunk." I instantly thought that they would have a great time without me. Have you ever heard the one comedian talking about how you always leave the party at the worst time, and how your friends call you up the next day and all their stories start with "Ten minutes after you left...!" Today I thought ahead and called the friend up first. Of course, what do you think I heard? "DUDE FRED YOU MISSED IT! It was like the BEST NIGHT EVER! Blah blah blah we met up with and blah blah party and blah blah we got on TV and blah blah SOOOO funny bork bork bork." Worse? THEN you have to tell them what you did, and it was "I read the paper and went to bed early." Bork bork bork.

      CD: Beatles, "Past Masters Vol. 1"  So my father was flipping channels and got to some old movie about the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. So he watches it for a minute and he goes "Did they ever get their baby back?" [ed. note: This is where the reader starts thinking "Barbeque Sauce."] And I tell him "No." Then I add, "They found it later." So then he goes "Was it okay?" Well if they didn't get the kid back, I don't know!! And THEN he goes, "Was it dead?" Oh my. I myself have tried to stop asking The Redundant Question. You know, comments like "Really?" or "You don't say" or "Are you sure?" I know it annoys some people to no end, while for others it is 90 percent of what they might deem--with conviction--"conversation." It's worse on the phone, where if you don't INTERJECT with banter like "Yeah," "Uh-huh," or "HAHAHAHA" people will think you're not listening and get all "Are you still there?" at you. Yeah, whatever, okay, bye-bye, see you later then. Have a nice day!

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Highway 61 Revisited"  I just finished vacuuming. My father has taken quite a liking to eating popcorn, and he's also found a fine hobby in not picking up dropped kernels. 'Tis sad that I must clean up after others, especially with a college degree, but I do live here rent-free. I guess I should really be complaining that I don't yet have a career, especially with a college degree. Well anyway, I was sucking up all these unpopped kernels when one of them got inside the machine and made this giant POW. Then I thought to myself, "What if it's extremely hot in the vacuum, and it's actually possible to make popcorn INSIDE THE VACUUM CLEANER!?" I tried again as I drove over some more kernels but I couldn't get the same loud noise. Maybe I can get a scientist to work on it. With an unused vacuum bag, of course...

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Love And Theft"  I'm stupid, stupid, stupid. I've complained about this problem with my computer for about a month now. According to my stupidity, the modem wasn't working correctly, as every time I connected my telephone line to the machine all the phones would go dead. Well. So they sent me a new machine, and the first thing I saw when I opened the box was a big sheet saying "How to set up your computer." On that was a diagram showing all of the ports and jacks and whatnot, but it didn't seem right...after all, my phone jack was on the side, not the back...OR IS IT. You know how an Ethernet jack looks a lot like a phone jack? Well, that just shows how stupid Stupid STUPID I am. Here I've been making calls for about a month when all I had to do was put the phone cord in the slot marked with a little picture OF A TELEPHONE NEXT TO IT. This is stupidness of "Did you trying plugging it in?" caliber. No, worse. Almost to the point of it being, "It's loaded, but I clean it real fast." Bah!

      CD: Dan The Automator, "Wanna Buy A Monkey?"  I have developed a theory which I call "Denny's Late Night." Research for this theory has taken about five years and possibly hundreds of dollars. The theory is as follows: when it's the weekend, it's after 11 and no one knows what to do, we end up at Denny's. Sad, yes, but true. I thought the theory was only applicable in the Buffalo area, but apparently it works in the Southtowns as well. I'm almost positive it works on Transit. Anyway, after arguing in a parking lot for near half an hour, the theory kicked in like clockwork. We TRIED going to Applebee's. We TRIED going to Chili's. We TRIED looking at shows and considered hanging out at someone's house. But the Theory, man. Maybe it should be declared a Law of Nature, like gravity and the Yankees. We need more stuff to do.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl" [again]  This is my post about paper clips. First you got your dinky clips. These are the ovular ones that are too small to ever be used on more than 3 sheets of paper. Canât stand them. Then thereâs the medium size. Those are almost okay, but sometimes they have little ridges or niches and I donât know why. I donât see it helping the clipsâ semi-dinkiness any. So then you get the big ovular ones, which are cool. You can put like 25 sheets in there securely. Awesome. You also have those ones that look like two triangles welded together. I may prefer these. In this case the mediums are probably best because the large ones tend to let sheets slip out if donât use them on enough papers (ten minimum is probably good). Then you got the black clamps. They usually only come in one size, unless youâre some sort of industrial secretary. You need at least 30 sheets for those. Ever use them with only 15 sheets? Schwag. So my pick goes to the medium-size triangle clips. Word is bond. And with that, I have written a post about paper clips. We can only go up from here.

      CD: Justin Timberlake, "Justified"  [It's actually not half bad. It's not half good, either, but it's not half bad.]  The best part about talking to other teachers is hearing their stories. There are a lot of odd children out thereâ¦.Anyway all you have to do is mention one interesting thing that happened âin my school todayâ¦â and they will all chime in. It reminds me of a pick-up game of basketball, actually. It starts out with you just shooting around, nonchalantly, at an empty hoop. Then some friends shoot around with you. Thatâs cool; youâre just enjoying the company. Then it gets competitive. They want to play a real game. But you wanted to just shoot around, dangit, you didnât want to work up a sweat or anything. But now you have to do it. And then someoneâs playing defense on you and they get all up in your face, thinking their story, I mean their game is better than yours. And then you have to fight them. They chose knives. Stay cool, boy. Bernardo, no!

      CD: various, "The Roots Of Rap"  This is going to sound extremely disgusting but I think Iâm sick again. This time it involves the collection of metric tonnes of mucus, phlegm, snot, spit, and other things that are pretty much the same thing in the way that magma and lava are synonyms. No later than every thirty minutes of every day this week, I must go through the process of draining myself. Blowing my nose has become a marathon eventâand no, itâs not running! Each nostril, one at a time, must be configured to give ample space for âreleaseâ; basically meaning that itâs like a canal lock in there. It will take days to get there, sure, but eventually the stuff will reach its destination. Unless it goes the express route, which is a singular violent, unexpected and potentially embarrassing cough. But thatâs enough about that.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl"  Joeâs making fun of me because heâs a stupid idiot. Here I am at his TA office at UB, just making sure heâs not minding his own business and working hard, and here heâs all âbork bork bork chemistry bork borkâ and trying to correct papers. Well phooey on him. Iâm looking at him right now, the big oaf. With his big, reddish sideburns and $110 blue jeans, telling me how he finally got this ONE problem done after working on it all day. Oh, now here he goes, out the door. Going to be stupid elsewhere. What a moronic imbecile. Iâm not sure if I believe this âchemistryâ stuff exists or heâs just writing a bunch of arrows and numbers on a page. Real scholars are going to look at his notes one day and tell everybody heâs King Tut. Wherever he is now, I hope he falls in. Hi Joe, I know youâre reading.

      CD: Dan The Automator, "Wanna Buy A Monkey?"  So anyway the good folks at Dell are like anyone else when you have a complaint. First they actually try to help you, because chances are you're dumb and fixing the problem will only take a second. When it's something worse, they'll try to sound like they're helping but they really don't know what they're talking about. They will offer you a solution that might not work, but it pacifies you and keeps you off their tail. They sent me some replacement parts, but in a couple days I would have to call them back and complain again. So they tried Step 2 on me again and I was like "been there." That means I had to step it up by myself, and demand to see a manager. Of course I had to tell the operator that "it's not your fault, but I have to speak to them," because if you don't they either think you're hostile and need more psychologial support than technical, or you want to get them fired out of blind vengeance. If you keep bugging the manager--who will try only to reiterate all the bad solutions you've heard before--they WILL help you out, but only according to protocol. In this case I learned that the company's last resort is to give you a new hard drive. It has nothing to do with fixing a modem, but play along. The next day the hard drive came in the mail, the modem still didn't work, I called in again all formal like, and it was all wham, new computer, thank you ma'am. And to think I didn't learn anything while working at Burger King....

      CD: Jurassic 5, "Bonus Tracks" promo  There's a commercial playing on TV nowadays that supposedly shows the Dell Tech Support Center (the Interns turn the lights off on them at night). The point of the ad is to show that the good folks at Dell work 24/7 to handle Your Call and help you get on your way. Like all ads, half of it is true. Yes, they're actually quite helpful and polite and whatnot, but there is a glaring error in this one. In the commercial, everyone speaks English! I dare you to call Dell Tech Support and get someone who speaks English as a first language! And after about a month of pondering it, I've finally decided that the people who DO work there in Real Life are all Korean. Why are they all in Nashville? No clue! But it sounds like I keep calling the Wong Family Reunion because they all sound the same, and they're nice as h*ck but NONE of them can get my laptop working. Oy!

      CD: Mahalia Jackson, "Gospels, Spirituals,  Hymns" disc II  My first decree as Emperor of the Free World will be to suppress all those who dare question my power. That goes without saying, really. All opposition must be squashed. How to destroy these rebel forces is the problem. Should I simply isolate and ostracize them? Should I infiltrate their infrastructure and tear them apart from within? Should I kill off their leadership and let the society fall into riotous turmoil? Should I bribe the populace with weapons, food, and lower taxes? Oh well. The second decree is to ban nuclear weapons, because everyone who opposes me will be gone so I wonât need them anymore. That was hard. Third? Iâm buying the Buffalo Sabres. They will also get 25 points added to their season record so when they donât make the playoffs this year it wonât look so bad.

      CD: Mahalia Jackson, "Gospels, Spirituals,  Hymns" disc I  If you have a satellite dish, you can watch tons of sports youâve either never heard of or never really cared about. Right now the World Cup of Cricket is playing a reel of highlights. I still donât know what the heck theyâre doing over there, but they seem to be training pretty hard. I can watch handball, curling, lacrosse, and something that I think is called slamball. Slamball is basketball, but with trampolines built into the floor. So now the players can dunk from three-point range, assuming someone doesnât try to block them in midair, causing them to collide twenty feet up. And hit the ground. And bounce back up. The first time I saw it I thought it was a Gatorade ad, but then they cut to commercial. I just sat there thinking âWuh?â Have you seen this sport? Oddness.

      CD: Pete Seeger, "American Industrial Ballads"  The President used to look really stupid, like the kind of guy that needs extra time to read things. But since that whole September 11th thing, and that whole Iraq up the wazoo thing, it looks like heâs been thinking a lot more. You know, really pondering stuff and doing some problem solving. So now he looks smarter, but he also looks angrier. Itâs been my racist opinion that dumb people are usually happier. I think itâs because they know of more problems in the world, like war and famine, while the not-so-thoughtful people watch American Gladiators. And while looking at this weblog a second time before posting it, I can see that my lack of word variety, such as the using the word âthingâ three times instead of using more descriptive diction, just proves that Iâm at least borderline inside the American Gladiators group.

      CD: Coal Chamber, "Chamber Music"  Sometimes sentences seem really strange out of context. I heard one of them from a friend several weeks ago. He said, âI got addicted to sushi in Nashville.â Addicted? Sushi? Nashville? Those are three nouns I never thought Iâd hear in succession. Anyway, itâs just a fun game to play with yourself if you feel bored at work, school, or especially while talking to your parents. (They always end up bringing up medical stuff, and thatâs hilarious.) So the newest addition to the canon was at church the other day. At the end of the sermon the pastor gave this big, involved story about, um, lots of stuff. To sum up, he said: âGod may not need your baloney, but he wants to give you his chicken.â Yep. Goodnight.   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 2/18/03 5:49:19 pm

And you know what? I donât really want to! BWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! But Iâve been thinking about a few things. Like, would you rather find mayonnaise in your peanut butter jar, or peanut butter in your mayonnaise jar? Think about it. What else was I thinking about? I forgot. Ooh! Why is a bicycle called a bike and a tricycle called a trike but a unicycle not called a unike? I need answers! Why do animals follow kids home, but donât follow adults? Why did that one guy quit Limp Bizkit? Why are they called Limp Bizkit? Why did they spell Bizkit with a Z? Why does everyone else call Z âZedâ? Who thought up all these silent letters? I DONâT LIKE SILENT LETTERS. Especially when itâs P. Silent Ps are messed up. Hey, I wrote another post!   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 2/18/03 5:47:47 pm

      CD: Liz Phair, "Whip-Smart"  For those of you that don't know, I'm keeping my eye on you. I have saved, with several exceptions, every IM conversation and every personal E-mail from the past 4+ years. That means you can pick a day--any day--and I can tell you what you said to me. (I can also tell you what other people said about you, but that would go against my principles.) When I sent my computer in for repairs I kept these texts online, stored in my online mailbox, but after a month without a base the mailbox is getting full. Now I must transfer almost 200 correspondences to permanent data storage (a disc). That's going to take me a long, freaking time. Nuts. But if you ever DO want to know what you were saying (especially when you weren't sober, which happens more offen than you'd like to admit it) give me a ring.

      CD: Squirrel Nut Zippers, "The Inevitable"  I was just thinking back to about a month ago when my father enlisted my help to get a desk out of my church in the middle of the night. It was one of those larger secretaries' desk with the filing cabinets built in. Also remember that it was around 0 degrees outside and windy, and the path from the door to the car was uphill and covered with about six inches of ice. The desk took an ample amount of pushing just to get it through the door (it technically did not fit), but it was the freezing cold and the absolute lack of solid footing that did me in. And I must be honest: right there, in front of my father and on church property, I still yelled out "F*CK!" as I slipped and let that 250 pound piece of office furniture fall on top of me. The end.

      CD: Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, âXtra Acme USAâ  For some reason this little light has been on in my car that says something like âServiceâ underneath it or something. I had no idea. Eventually I had to pull out the manual and find out what the bloody thing actually WAS, let alone what it meant. After searching through a few pages of hieroglyphics, I found out it was the Engine light. That could mean a lot of things, like âthe carâs computer needs tweakingâ or âitâs going to blow up.â I figured it was closer to the first thing and only yesterday got an appointment at the dealership. After setting a time they gave me some line about the gas cap not being on tight enough or something, and to check that, but itâs almost an insult to my intelligence to suggest I missed something like that (of course, I once drove from Indianapolis to Columbus with the tank door upon). I then tried to think of something quick, almost an excuse to say I was in there for a Reason other than ineptitude. âWell, I, uh, hit a couple mailboxes a while back.â âOh!â they collectively cried. That was a couple months ago, but I got those guys on my side now. Plus, now theyâve got a story to ask me about when Iâm hanginâ out over there tomorrow! Keen!

      CD: Black Label Society, âBlack Label Societyâ  Joe was in my room the other day and commented on all the books I had. Well thank you Joe! Looking at them right now it does seem like I have a lot of books--like a wall full. I must admit, however, that it is an illusion. For instance, about a quarter of my shelf space is taken up by vinyl records. It means Iâm less of a reader, though it does make me cooler.  There is a small section at the top corner which is really not books but old magazines and yearbooks, which are only worth looking at once every couple of years. My stereo takes up the rest of the top shelf. So that leaves only three small shelves worth of books. Now I must admit that I read a whole shelf of me. I did NOT, however, read the other two shelves! For example, about one shelf is a bunch of history textbooks I took for free from a teacher that wanted to get rid of the promotional stuff sheâs saved over the years. And the third shelf? On the bottom of each book is a little sticker that says USED SAVES. No REAL book-reader in their right-thinking mind would proudly display Used Book stickers on their Used Books! Take a second look, Joe, Iâm not as smart as I look!

      CD: Eminem, Â¡Â§The Eminem ShowÂ¡Â¨  IÂ¡Â¦ve been going back and forth with the good people at Dell because my computer is messed up. I thought that they must have these giant banks of people in Customer Service, but apparently thereÂ¡Â¦s just this guy named Walter that handles all my calls. Poor Walter. He has an accent from who-knows-where, and he does this weird thing where he slows down and speeds up what he says in mid-phrase, sometimes pausing in between. If I knew what the accent was, I might be able to translate! Anyway, the first couple of times I called Walter seemed all chipper and Â¡Â§How may I help you?Â¡Â¨-ish. (Kind of cocky, too, if you ask me.) But today he seemed depressed. He talked slower and signed before he said stuff like Â¡Â§Thank you for calling Dell. How may I help you today.Â¡Â¨ âÂ²Note the period! I hope everything is all right at home. Walter seems like a decent guy, and having to work at Tech. Support you gotta feel bad for him. Sadly, the two hours I spent with him today probably just made him feel worse Â¡Â¥cuz he couldnÂ¡Â¦t help out at all. He seemed happier at Wegmans.

      CD: U2, "Best Of 1990-2000"  This afternoon I finally got my voice back enough that I can speak whole sentences with cracking or going into a coughing fit--well, mostly. But it has also given me an extremely low voice. Maybe I have somehow widened my voice box or something, I don't know, but when I can talk I sound like Barry White. So my brother met one of my friends at his work today and they decided to call me. First they didn't know who it was, but once they figured out the situation they put me on Speaker Phone at Guitar Center and had me say stuff for fun like "Ohhhhh Bay-bee" reeeeel slooooow. This is the one part about strep throat that I'm going to miss. That and sleeping in until... well, sometimes I didn't "technically" get up. I wonder if it's possible to get my voice box surgically widened so I can talk like Barry White all the time! Oh baby! Or James Earl Jones at least! "THIS IS CNN." Cool!

      CD: Frank Sinatra, "The Very Good Years"  Now my entire family is hooked on Subway subs. Today I had my fourth in a week. That's right! The delicious taste of Subway subs has come home. A new franchise opened up near my house ("near" is like six miles away over here) and my father decided to check it out. Now he can't get enough, and has already filled enough Sub Club cards to get a free sub and then some! Woo! Sometimes when my family is eating them at home people will just randomly say things like "I really like their choice of bread; it's great that they make it right in the store" and "it doesn't bog you down like regular subs; it fills you up without making you full!" as if they were that Jerod guy or something. So here's the deal, Subway: put us in your commercials as The Subway Family, watch your sales go through the roof, and then give us free subs for the rest of our days! Rock over London, rock on Chicago, Subway: eat fresh! Whee!

      CD: Coldplay, "A Rush Of Blood To The Head"  I do wonder how many people in the news departments of America realize that something like "Operation: Iraqi Freedom" proves by its own name that its portrayal by the United States Government is propaganda at the very least. I don't know about you, but when the people of a nation really want to be liberated, shouldn't they do it themselves? Heck, even the French knew that. So why can't the Iraqis? Are they lazy? Or maybe it's something worse: they don't want to overtake Saddam Hussein. And if I may compare Iraq to the American and French Revolutions (and even the Bolshevik Revolution), when those countries were "liberated" they Stopped being controlled by foreign powers, not the opposite. Why should the United States do something that a people should earn for themselves? Bah!

      CD: The Donnas, "Spend The Night"  Whilst bowling this night, I happened perchance to partake of a faulty bowling ball returning machine. For some reason the balls would not come back from the magical chute in the ground! So I've been thinking about it, and just what goes on begind those pins, anyway? I know Fred Flintstone had a pterydactyl (sp?) putting his day's work in, putting up carved-rock pins and making funny little comments, but what about today? And how do you keep score in a bowling game? How does 10 times 10 equal 100? One thing has never changed, and it is the definition of the bowling experience: Shoes. I'm going to call Calvin Klein and suggest a bowling clothes line--the untucked, shiny, button shirts, sure, but the multi-colored, pseudo-leather shoes are the epitome of retro fashion! It's like stepping your feet into 1978. If you could only wear them to interviews...

Seeing how I've gone there sporadically for the past two years now for research purposes, wouldn't I know my way around by now? NOOOOO! What's up with that? The other day I drove around the campus, deftly maneuvering the I-290, the Millersport Highway, Niagara Falls Boulevard and some wierd private access road to make a beautiful circle ten miles in diameter. I wanted to go in a straight line! Argh! Today I had to be at a class in half an hour, and of course I drove out of a completely different exit that I went into and got lost, and late. How is that possible if I take the same road I came IN campus with and end up OUT of campus two streets away? And why haven't I bought a compass after all this time? Bork!!

      CD: Guided By Voices, "Isolation Drills"  There is a bookcase in my room that is about six feet high...in parts. We found it one Christmas when the neighbors across the street threw it out. Covered with ice, we brought it upstairs. The wood is all bent up now, and it is probably getting worse because now it is loaded with a couple hundred books I don't read and another couple hundred records I don't listen to, not to mention the yearbooks I am ashamed to look at placed next to the stereo I can barely reach. Yet there it all sits. It's a monolith of furniture and an archives depository all at once. Now that it is full, what do I do with it? Should I go find more garbage as an add-on? should I buy Real bookshelves? Wait for an earthquake and see what's left? Good thing I don't really care.

      CD: Weezer, "Weezer" [2001]  If I don't turn off the television, I end up watching the war for eight hours, and that just can't be healthy. The satellite dish gives me about eight differnet channels to watch...I got ABC, NBC, CBS, ITV, BBC, CBC, NWI, CNBC, CNN, CNNFN, MSNBC, KMFDM, LMNOP, and, of course, NWA. All I know is that you can get those nasty pictures on Al-Jazeera's website even without reading Arabic, that the "War Desk" on CNNFN has my laptop on it, and that first night where they were blowing stuff up like crazy? THAT was fun, admit it! I do wonder how much less news I'd have to watch if the US and Iraq could stop using all that rhetoric about how victory is inevitable, and our soldiers are brave and courageous, bork bork bork. Maybe from eight hours to seven.

      CD: Moby, "Play"  I recently bought a cell phone. That means you have to write to all of your friends and give them your new number, which they will easily forget the first couple of times they need to call you. That's not a problem. The most disappointing thing in my situation, however--and this was pointed out to me by one of the friends I wrote to--was that my E-mail was sent out to nine people. Nine. Sad, huh? I pay $35 dollars a month so I can talk to nine people. Four of them live in my house. Or is it more depressing when one of them writes back and makes fun of you for only writing to nine people? Or that he just got a cell phone, too, and will probably only call three or four people with it? Or that it's 11:20 on a Monday morning and I still haven't gotten out of bed? Alas.

      CD: Pavement, "Slanted And Enchanted" (deluxe)  It is 12:10 AM. What a great day this March 23rd has been! Definitely in the top 1000 of good days. What did I do today? Oh, gee...let me think. Well, I was reading this newspaper, as I am wont to do sometimes, and it was really interesting! Yeah! But then I thought to myself, "Hey, I wonder if I have any E-mail to check." So about halfway through the day, at about 12:05 AM, I checked my E-mail! I didn't have any! Wow! I wonder if I'll ever get any more. I guess only time will tell, huh? Already a mystery. Then I decided that since it was a new day, I would add to my weblog. I was listening to my Pavement album the night before, so I started of my new post with the title of the album I had played. Coincidence? No, silly! Then I started writing my weblog. It was about 12:10 in the morning by then. Well, what a day! I better get some rest. Toodles for now!

      CD: Rage Against The Machine, "Rage Against The Machine"  Spring Break has been a wash. Compared to previous Spring Breaks, where I was out of town and on vacation, I have done some homework. So this is a 100% increase. Yet, thirty minutes isn't exactly going to help me out like I'd hoped. On one hand, I did go bowling last night. It was much more enjoyable than, say, a study of 17th century Dutch economics. I really don't know how to fully articulate what I'm saying, because I was out all night and didn't get any sleep, but it's too bad I didn't get any papers done. I'll just have to blame the war or something. That darned Saddam! Why couldn't he be like that nice Timothy McVeigh boy and be easier to catch?! Hmm, I probably shouldn't have said that...like that. Wait, what did I just say? I better get some sleep...it's a good reason for not starting more homework, too...

      CD: various, "Negros Blues And Hollers"  Most every night, my father sits on the couch once he gets home and doesn't get up. He eventually falls asleep on the couch, snoring and keeping me awake. Then I have to close my bedroom door and since the heater is in my room, the building goes cold while my room gets to be about 90 degrees, so I have to keep a window cracked open in the middle of winter. So last night I put my foot down. Well, my butt. I got home first, grabbed my laptop, the remote and a book. I laid on that couch for several hours before he got home. He sat on one end of the couch and started nodding off, except for the couple of times he would turn his head, slowly open his eyes and see if I was still there. You could see the disappointment in him. A couple of times he would mumble something about "Well I guess I should go to bed soon..." right before he would glance at me. At about 1:30 he finally capitulated and went to his bedroom for good. I had won the night. I told my sister what I did and we celebrated for several seconds. Then I told her I was tired out too from all my squatting and I went to bed. The end.   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 3/20/03 2:45:36 am

      CD: Fiona Apple, "When The Pawn..."  This war thing is taking forever. Just think, if they do reenactments of it in 2203, it will involve sitting in the desert for 3 months, doing nothing. It'll be pretty boring, that's for sure. And then one of the troop reenactors will pull out a laptop computer and press a button, something will blow up, and the battle will be over. Not that I want anyone to die in this war, or that I want this war at all, but come on already. it really has been twelve years since this thing has started. I almost like Bush for being impatient. Saddam Hussein is like that one kid in elementary school that was so annoying that you wanted to pop him one but he never got caught doing anything wrong. He would make fun of you and then hide behind a tree in the playground or stand next to the teacher so you couldn't rough him up. Still, if you ignored him he would go away after a while...

      CD: Talib Kweli, "Quality"  My theory is has been tried and tested, and still true: If there is no specific reason to get together, as my friends and I did the other night, we will somehow end up at Denny's. That doesn't mean we specifically want to go to Denny's. What used to be a fun outing has turned into a tradition and then an out and out regrettable situation. Last night I decided that since I was driving, we were just going to drive down one road until someone decided what we were going to do next. We got halfway to driving off of the Niagara Falls when I had to give up and turn around. It's a shame when your posse physically GOES to several places says "NO! We must go do Denny's." But you know what? They have darn good sandwiches and pies and I barely care anymore. Moons Over My Hammy for everyone! I had a great time. Free refills!

      CD: James Brown, "Say It Live And Loud: Live In Dallas 08.26.68"  Someone mentioned that it's going to look really bad when the United States declares war on Iraq and the world press comes to get our reaction, and everyone is drunk and dancing in the streets with party hats and floats because it's St. Patrick's Day. They're going to have a field day with us. I never really liked this holiday because I don't drink and don't like drunks, but since green is my favorite color I guess it's passable as a celebration. Interesting, though, that we're starting a war to combat terrorism (or whatever they call it) around a day celebrating the Irish, who would be World Terrorist Enemy #1 if it weren't for that whole Arab-Israeli thing. How many people have died from Irish terrorist acts? Nomatter. All we know over here in the states was that there was some sort of famine and what do you know, everyone in the Fire Department has a name that starts with "O'." Also, Lucky Charms is the best kids' cereal ever.

      CD: Taleb Kwali, "Quality"  Yesterday I went to downtown Buffalo, which was interesting because it was actually nice out for once and people were taking walks, looking around at the city like they just came out of their bomb shelters. It was Saturday, so no one had much of a reason to be there. We were just surprised the sun was shining and stuff wasn't falling from the sky. On the windows of the abandonned Burger King was a sign that said "Fat, Ugly Italian Male looking for Nice Girl with a Sense of Humor, 878-xxxx." That was kind of funny. The subway was half-filled with people that didn't want to look at each other. I was the most handsome person there. I rode the subway down to its last stop at South Campus and the floor was really slippery, probably from the moisture with the weather and everything melting. Dangerous.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl"  Some months ago I made what could be called the Mother Of All Mix Albums, or MOAMA, for some foreign guys at work. Tonight I pulled it out and copied to my laptop and dude, this is fun! Now I technically have my own portable MP3 player! Whee! And it's already loaded with 200 of my favorite songs. The best part is that I forgot what songs I put on the thing so I get a pleasant surprise every three minutes or so. Now I recall the three days it took for me to put the MOAMA together; how I fussed over song selection, how I tried to be eclectic (no band appears more than once) while still fitting everything in. Finally my hard work, though relatively still useless, is paying off. AND, as an added bonus, WinAmp is automatically fading in between tracks. Fantastic.

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Riot Act"  The best part about my winter trip to Europe may not be the actual vacation but the ability to refer to it in conversation later. Watching the news today they showed the Chancellor of Germany giving a speech to the legislature, and DUDE I was IN THAT BUILDING! Cool! Somewhere I learned that Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's favorite tourist attraction in Rome is the Spanish Steps, and I was ON those steps! Whenever they talk about the Eiffel Tower, the EU headquarters in Belgium, the Vatican's plea for peace in the Middle East...I was there, making me an EXPERT compared to all y'all who are only TALKING about the stuff! So they want to rename French Fries "Freedom Fries" because they think the French are snooty, self-centered anti-Americans? Well guess what? I was actually IN FRANCE and they ARE snooty, self-centered anti-Americans. How about those pommes, Jacques?

      CD: "Langley Schools Music Project"  Spring Break. Wooooooooo. There are no girls going wild here in farm country, nor do I see Fat Joe getting ready to perform. Even the upcoming St. Patrick's Day holiday fails to pique the interest of our Germanic neighbors. What to do then? Well, it seems that my academic adversaries, or "professors," have all designed that I must write them a 15-20 page paper. So instead of warm beaches and cold water (The ocean's always cold no matter where you are, isn't that such a disappointment?) I will get to visit cold libraries and search for old books. Maybe I'll even stop procrastinating long enough to write something down. My Beach House will consist of a bunch of bundled-up, grandfatherly dudes trying to look up totally rad geneology records! Party on!
