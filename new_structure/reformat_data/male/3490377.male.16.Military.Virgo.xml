      Summer is tiring. REALLY tiring. There's so much to do and I can't do it all! Man. I don't even want to type this entry, but I feel so out of it when I don't.  This will have to suffice for now.

      Well, Sunday's show was so fun! Even though I kept getting mad at the drums (I could barely hear them and I kept messing up and getting angry!) we all played pretty well, Patrick's voice sounded good, Jamie's solos were awesome. Everlasting Glow came first place, Ten Dollar Thompson came second, and Solemn Fist (RICHMOND REPRESENT!!) came third. We had a good time on stage and got to meet the other bands and give each other advice. It was pretty awesome. Except that in the band room upstairs there was a bed...WHY WAS THERE A BED UP THERE I ASK YOU!!  Anyway, takin a bit of a break this week to just relax and enjoy the sun. Tonight Stef and I will be going to see Shamble play at Tynnehead Hall (I think) in Surrey, so that'll be interesting. Salmon Festival tomorrow! Canada Day woo!! That's always fun. Too bad the Garry Point fireworks aren't happening this year...or so I hear. Narcis, Karmacanix, Second, Ether's Void (with their new bassist!) and Rally Car are all playing in the Steveston field tomorrow, so everyone come check it out, it's free! And play some games and eat some salmon while you're at it. I'm not a fan of salmon...  Next Friday, Free Parking is playing at the Stardust Battle Of The Bands Finals, and it's $7.50 with a discount card from one of the bands. Otherwise I think it's $10...but it'll be a good show. You should all go. GO!  I still have to talk to that guy about buying his double kick. SO CLOSE to getting a double kick, SO CLOSE.  That is all for now! Stay tuned!

      This part of the summer is truly when the confusion kicks in to summer. How so? Well, I was told that we might be going to the beach on Wed. It is that day today and I have no clue what's going on, and people want me to play hockey. What to do? I really don't know. The summer definitely has it's times like these, and it confuses the crap out of me, because I easily get confused. Another thing is I never have a good tow course meal. My parents leave no food in the house so I pretty much starve. Being hungry really sucks too! Especially when your waiting to find out if were going to the beach.   I guess it comes back to me being out of the loop in a way. I think. It always seems I'm the last person to know about things and I'm pretty much doing nothing all day so anyone can call me or anything. Sure, it does have to do with me being lazy and not calling people but I truly dislike phoning people. It's really weird, a Robson gene I'm guessing, because I hate calling people. I love getting phone calls,  but calling no. Yes, another weird characteristic of me.   One thing that kind of made me a little disappointed was the camp cabins. When Matt, Nick and Dyllan wrote down who they wanted in their cabin, none of them put my name in. I mean, I am the rookie, it's not like I'm going to know everyone there.   Once again, I blame my absence in Richmond. I'm not in the neighborhood so no one comes to me house and says lets go out. I'm not in Richmond so the thought of involving me sometimes slips their mind, not because they don't like me, but because I'm too far away or they just simply forget. I'm not blaming my friends, I would never do that, it's just I sit hear bored in my house with nothing else to do but talk about my boredom.   So yeah I was bored last night and I couldn't get to sleep so I thought I would practice my golf swing. I ended up breaking the ceiling fan! Ha! Oh it was funny but I think I just broke the light bulb cause I replaced it and it works again. Oh well, that's what happens when your bored...

      Guys I hate to be lame and post on a blog about my other blog...but you guys will dig this: urlLink  A post about Andy!  I promise you, no more lame posts like this.   Have you guys also checked out the MSN group for RPC Youth?  urlLink  It is here  and has some cool stuff, like pictures, and the latest "Slamball: Vincent Edition" updates. Intense reading guys.  Sometimes I get the feeling that that MSN group has a lot of potential fun, but it's just not given the proper publicity it needs... people need to know the URL and it needs to be flashy and have random pictures in places. But I guess they don't allow you to edit the source much, crazy MSNers.

      Well, I'm not sure what to think about my report card. I've never seen an F on one  of my report cards. I saw it coming, it shoul;dn't be a surprise, but somehow it still hurts. So yeah, I passed Math and French, which is a huge victory. I went to go tell my conselor about droping a course next year to take eart science (the easiest science) when I came across a problem. Turns out eart science is full,so I gotta take BIO now!!! Noooooooo!!!! Just as I thought everthing was going as planned, it some how jumps the tracks. Well, i guess its not that bad. But wasn't planning on taking Bio.   So how on earth did the Liberals win again? That's insane! Notice how the conservatives won almost all the western provinces yet they still lost? Shows how much the east dominates the west.

      What's up with players I like? Poor Lalime was traded and now Geoff is gone! So disapointing. Anywho...  Sunday was fun, we went to Timmy Ho's and Dyllan came, it was good times. Of course Nick and Dyllan had some good coments on Anne being at my place Sunday by herself, and no one else. We all had a good laugh, except I turned all red. Then Dyllan and I took a walk and we had a good chat and I really enjoyed that.   Today was watetmania and that was pretty cool. I got to chill with Nellisa and we really don't talk much so that was pretty cool. Yep Yep  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looking forward to Canada Day. It's gonna be AWSOME!

      All-Nighter 2004: officially complete. It was a success, with a few minor set-backs, but we're alright.  After I got home, I showered, slept from 8:30 AM 'till 11 AM, and then I got up. Everyone else slept 'till afternoon (at least) or like, 4 PM or something. But yeah, I got up and ran the rest of the day on two and a half hours of sleep. Not bad, if I may say so. But yes, I woke up, had lunch with Sam at the mall, and then postered stuff with Mikey.  All in all, a rad day.    Message to MATT: I would LOVE to go to your house to make lunch tomorrow. I'll have to check with the 'rents though, since I'm already out in Vancouver tomorrow evening. (Mesa Luna thing.) Speaking of which, Dyllan's apparently not going.

      So the best part of the all nighter was after are conversation we met with the girls and Steph came up and said "We Talked About Sex" in like the funniest way. I can't remember how but it was soooooooo funny!  Anywho, when your tired, everything seems extra long. While walking to No 3 I thought I was there, I wasn't even half way!!! Everything seemed to crawl!!! I was like, oh well, 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday, I'll have the B Line to myself!. YEAH RITE! It was full!!! Where are people going at this time? It's a Saturday!! Sleep in! The walk from 70th to my house was even worse, because I just wanted to be home, NOW!  I got home and I closed all the blinds and curtains in my house and turned my living room into my bed room. I couldn't really sleep so I brouth the PS2 up, yes I wasn't sick of it yet, and played a game of hockey. Sure enough, it worked! I went right to sleep and woke up at 4! It was a great sleep!  So now I sit at home with nothing to do because I don't want to call others yet because they might still be sleeping. Anywho, if your bored, call me, or message me, anything!  Attention JC and fellow Bloggers! I propose lunch at my house Sunday after church! It would be fun! My nice cozy house all to ourselves and I could cook! Haha! yeah right. But if interested, let me know!

      Matt, your question reminds me much of a question I asked myself as I moved out of home; "When is a good time to call home?" The answer that I gave myself was "Never". I hated home. Going to college was the out. I didn't have to deal with anyone! It was truly great. I went almost a month and a half without calling.   The question you need to ask yourself is "Am I (enter stop mom's name here)'s child, or is (enter step mom's name here) my Dad's wife?" What this means is...from HER point of view. Is her priority to her children, or to her husband, or is it balanced? Are her nagging endeavours motivated by mischief or by nature to protect, nurture?   These questions are easy to answer while emotioned... "She's just a lame bitch that wants to ride my ass all day. She's no good anywhere." I know what that feels like. But don't be disceved. This may not be your step-mom.  I don't know what it's like to lose family. I can imagine that you must feel something akin to how invasive her presence is, that she doesn't belong there. Just know that no one can ever replace your Mom, no one will ever be the same that she was. Your step-mom is a completely different person.   "You don't know someone till you walk a mile in their shoes". Tell me you all know where that comes from...  Put yourself in her shoes. You are your step-mom. Are you a mom, or are you a wife?

      I really do dislike my Step Mom. I've seen her probably less then an hour since she has got back from her trip (which was Sunday) and I try not to think about it, but it's so hard when she keeps on bugging me!! I just don't know what to do. The worst part is it reminds me just how much I miss my mom and I go to bed crying. Is it really that bad? Well, depends from your point of view, some stuff just really annoys me. It has to be her way. It can't be done a diferent way because it has to be done her way, because she is so smart and her way is the best. It's so frustrating, it really is. I just want to do something to really make her... I dunno, show her how I feel. I know, I'm a christian, I shouldn't hate her, but its hard, it really is. Now I have a question, for anybody to answer. Say I've just started my life career and my dad passes away. Do i stay in contact with her? Do I really want to. I mean, she has done many nice things, but it's what the average mom should do. Just all the bad times come back. Do I call her once a month? Or like Christman and Thanksgiving? Fred himself doesn't even talk to her, just my dad. I think the Fire of hate for her still burns. And as for Sarah, I never think they will bee on even terms. I really hope none of you guys have to, or ever have to go through what I have had to go through. I mean, at 8 years old until now is pretty hard to deal with, the older it gets the easier it is.   Anywho, enough with the depresion, I just like to get feelings outta my head. Nobody really is posting much. People busy with summer and exams I guess. Today kinda sucked. Work was a repeat of yesterday, and then I just played hockey and have sat home here. But anywho, going to the beach tomorrow, YAY!   Don't forget to Answer the question! It really is one I've asked myself...for along time, input would kinda be nice, espesialy with the great wisdom from  ANDREW .(Hope You Caught That). Yay beach!!!!!!!

      So Tuesdat night is killing me at work. My boss has made me do some stupid thing I've never done, and It was soooooo bad! I was feeling like crap! I needed a boost from anyone. Sure enough, I saw Vincent. The guy who sometimes drives me nuts was there to make me feel better. I came up to him and said hey hows the game going? He was like oh it good man in his usual hows it going voice. We talked a bit and just as I left he said "Good Job With The Sales Man!". Oh man, I was sooooo happy, just that small boost helped me carry on through the pointless night. It's amazing what a little bit of  a boost can do.

      I DID MY CHEM AND MATH EXAMS TODAY! HURRAH! Obviously, I don't know what I'm got on them just yet, but I don't care, I DON'T NEED TO EVER DO ANOTHER ONE OF THESE CLASSES AGAIN!! FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!  MY WHOLE LIFE!!  That DOES feel good.  I made two mix CDs. One yesterday and one today. It made me happy. I designed a rad cover for both of them, with the track listing on it and a super awesome title for each CD. And then I finished burning the CDs and write the title on the CD with a  Sharpie marker , in neat little  B L O C K  letters. It's simple things like making a mix CD that make my  heart  smile.  I drove a lot today and yesterday. Remember how I said I talked a lot about driving the other day, with my parents? Well, I said something like, "I'm never allowed to ask to drive, and you never offer to let me drive, so I never get any practice!", so I guess my mom agreed, because she handed the keys to me many, MANY times today. She even let me start up the car and bring it around to the front of the building, while she went to the washroom! My brother sat in the backseat because he was afraid of sitting in the front. It was amusing. And I couldn't stop smiling. Because it was the first time I'd driven anyone ANYWHERE before (that is, without an adult in the car).  Sam, how about you and I go have some Teen Burgers on Wednesday before we meet with Chels for Lit study session? I have coupons that are going to expire soon and I don't want them to be discarded without having fulfilled their life's purpose.  2-for-1 TEEN BURGERS !!  Matt, I'm not angry about the cups being thrown. It just bugs me. Imagine how I feel. If you guys trash the place on a regular basis with slurpee cups, my caretaker will get mad and have to talk to me about it. Plus, are you guys coming to visit me or drop off garbage before church? That's just my take on it. I'm your friend, not your maid. I don't come to your house and throw slurpee cups around! (But then again, I've never been to your place. But when I come over this summer, I'm not going to be throwing slurpee cups around!) So I accept your apology and no biggie, but think about it first. Litter is BAD. Don't make me get all hippie on you! :D

      Steph, sorry that Dyllan threw our slurpee cups, we didn't think it was a big deal. But We are sorry.   So it was the girls choir drama thing tonight, and i was bored!! Other then the breath taking performances by Tom and Anne, I wanted to shoot myself. As Norman said, this thing is an hour and 30 minutes too long. It was funny. I was incedibly angry that i wasn't asked to be in it. I'm MAINSTAGE MATT! But I was quick to be thankful i wasn't in it. As my drama teachers have said, we are profesionals. The actors they had were like robots, with no character. I don't want to insult them, I mean, not many people have the courage to do that, and in such short amount of time, but it was far from good. Did it need to be good? No, but Mainstage has given me a bad character where I have to point out all the flaws of acting. I don't mean to be a jerk, but I'm blaiming mainstage. But yeah, Anne was funny, she was like soooo stuck up self absorbed girl. You could totaly buy that. Tom was funny at times, but you could tell he had memorized the lines and he was saying them by memory. He wasn't saying them naturally. But yeah, good times.

      As you may all know, McRoberts is not completely out of school (as most of you have nicely pointed out). I'm all good and prepared for math tomorrow (35 questions! All ROIGHT!) but Literature provincial is Thursday.  HELP!  Ippany-Steph and I must combine our superpower efforts to pass the Lit provincial! Hey, now that isn't such a bad idea...    IPPANYSPAM: The Industrial-Teen Revolution! Coming to comic book stores near you. Or near me. Hopefully near me so I don't have to bus.   Anyway, back on topic. Well, not the same topic. The Wicked Orange had quite the incredible band practice yesterday, and we started a new song (it's metal and it's either going to be about emo and fire, or killer robots [that invade the Whitehouse...ahaha! Jamie will kill me]). But anyway, I'm looking forward to my first time playing a show since last summer! It's gonna be awesome! Hey, might as well take the time to advertise.   The Wicked Orange! And 17 other awesome bands! Going all out, head to head, LAST BAND STANDING! Sunday! Sunday, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!! (funday?) June 27th at the Mesa Luna on West Broadway 5:00 pm - 12:30 am! Tickets are $10 online or from ME, or $15 at the door. Info and list of bands at  urlLink Supernova.com .      Whew. That was some hardcore advertising. Enjoy. I expect to see you all there.   By the way, I was looking at all of your  lovely  profiles when I found THIS on randomandrew's:  "You're going to the moon! What did you forget to pack?  stupid thing tells me i can only have 150 chars. how jewish. "    I'M  Jewish, nitwit. Does that mean I can only have 150 characters, as well, Mister Bond? Whatever  do   you mean, ANDREW? That's all I have to say.

        It's the time of the season  When the love runs high     Ok, I think we all know this song, but I'm not using it as a how it was originaly used. I'm using this song to talk about how Summer really brings the better sides of us out. How so? Well, my head is overloading with love for everyone I know, especialy the JC. Why? Because summer is making me go good crazy! How? Because there's no exams to worry about, no stress, no jerks to deal with at school. It's good times, and it makes me wanna hug all of you until your eyes pop out and shake my head to a rock song! The only bad thing, 1 person rule. But maybe Steph will be able to drive and we can have a convoy! YES! I can see it now. The JC presents it's wheels...  Speedy Reidy! Can go from 0 to 60 in 60 seconds and is older then all of us! Backup will be Car Killer, which by the way has an Awsome stereo system.  The Iponator! Just a work in proces, but we can't really name Steph's car until she has one. But a thought.  Oh man! let the good times roll! For example...  Tonight, I pick up Dyllan at his place. What you wanna do I ask? How much money you got he replies. Enough. Were going go karting. After an intense 10 minutes of hard core racing, we made our way to 7-11. On our journey Dyllan comes up with this Awsome plan. Lets go visit PJ! With our stomachs full, we went to his house with a surprise, and it turned out to be a night of watching   The Last Sumurai  . I probably spelt it wrong, but what an AWSOME movie. Dyllan and I cruised back home and here I am, inspired by the warm hot summer air to write this blog. Let's Rock With Love!    It's the time of the season for loving

      Wow, what a year, that was pretty insanely fun, a good time all in all. Grade 12 is going to come ridiculously fast, cuz this is going to be an amazing summer, and the amazing ones always go faster....alas, camp will be a wonderul experience, God's definately called me up for some reason. Music camp in courtney will be fun too, i'm still just nervous about it. I hope Meg gives me the two weeks off....how could she not, she loves me,lol. I'm the crew guy.....lol, oh the inside understanding that none of you will understand.....

       As we go on, we remember All the times we've had together And as our lives change from whatever We will still be friends forever...  Graduation - Vitamin C  In a way, I almost don't want Grade 11 to end. As much as I complain and talk about school being boring and such, I'm really scared for next year. I'm even scared for this summer. This'll be the last summer where I know that in September, I'll still be here. With my friends and everything that's been familiar to me for the last seven years. Come summer 2005, I'll be packing. Possibly moving to another province. I'm excited for this new chapter in life, but it scares the DAYLIGHTS out of me. New school, new people, new surroundings, new home (possibly). I'll be 18. I'll be legal. I gotta do my own LAUNDRY. (Not that I don't right now, but it's nice to have Mom help out a lot.)  There's so many people that I love and that I could never leave behind and yet, I will have to do just that when I go off to school next year. I can't explain this sense of mixed dread and anticipation that lies within my heart. It's frightening. Sometimes, I'll sit in my room, listen to music (specifically songs like The Verve's  Bittersweet Symphony  or David Usher's cover of  Fast Car ), and I cry. Not because I'm sad, but because I'm so excited and so scared at the same time. I know God has a plan for me and that things will work out in the end, but not knowing what that plan is makes me feel so blind. I understand that whatever lies in my future may take a lot of strength to complete, but... oh, my heart is so heavy with thoughts.  I'm excited for the all-nighter. It's things like these that create memories for me. Years from now, I'll still remember Matt's love of locomotives. Anne's uncanny ability to make people happy. Andrew's constant battles of logic. Ben's unwavering love of music and Jesus. Sam's strength and determination. Dyllan. (Just Dyllan because everything about him is fantastic.) Lauren and our hilariously aimless car rides to Tim Horton's and back. I love everyone one of you and I thank you for the impression you have left on my heart.

      I'm waiting for my CD to finish burning in the afternoon, and this may take a while. What do I do? Watch TV? Nah, nothing good on day time TV. Video games? No, not enough time to really get intoo it. But then an Idea comes to mind!! My trains! I hadn't played with them for almost two months! I had lost respect for my beloved trains! So, I sat down, and reconnected with my hobby. I even took my annual train notes  On CPR mainline, A CP Rail freight has just left the Port Coquitlam yards. It's a small mixed freight consisting of 34 cars. It's lead units are CPR SD40-2 5415 and 6027.   On CNR mainline, A small transfer freight has just left the New Westminster Yards heading towards CN's main yard, where hey will transfer the freight to a bigger one, which is heading to Kamloops. This train, also a mixed freigh, consists of 18 cars and the lead units are GP40 9306 and GP39 4103.  Wow, i still got it. Yeah, just like the good old days. Funny how Fred used to do this with me, now he gets payed to do this on the real thing. How amazing how dreams can become reality. My brother is living proof.   Ahhh trains, you gotta love them. Why not? Did they do anything to you? That's right, they didn't, there your friend...  And you gotta love your friends...

In any case...Have you been seasoning your lives lately? You know what I mean...  About that cool suprise I was supposed to do Sunday night, well it's happening friday night, at the all-niter. Be there or be squ...really regretful. Yes, squreally regretful.   All of you who are bored...Yes, you are bored. DON'T ARGUE WITH THE PREACHER.

      Matt's a real dork who thinks I don't post anymore. WE'LL SHOW HIM.  I had my Socials exam today. It was alright, but kinda shaky. I got all the stuff in the politics and geography sections, but the WW1 and WW2 sections pretty much kicked my ass. Oh well. I think I've done well enough in class during the year, that I won't completely bomb my final Socials mark. I have French and Biology tomorrow, which'll be a hoot and a half.  When my mom drove me to school this afternoon for my Socials exam, I passed the Westminster and Garden City intersection and I saw Dyllan and a bunch of other kids walking to the church. Made me wish all my exams were done. Like now. Boooo.  I kinda feel like swimming, but I can't 'cause I gotta study more after this post. And I found two t-shirts in my closet the other day. I wore them when I was a little kid, but hey, they still fit, so I wore one of them today and I felt so rad.

      Well, no exams today, but get this! I got 75% on my english final!!! That's a B!! And another reason why i love english more then French.  So here I am, and it seems nobody realy posts anything anymore. Steph was going strong and then she died out. Just about the time I started puting lengthly posts on, such as this one. Sam hasn't posted anything ever since she joined, Andrew just leaves comments, and so on and so on. Really, i don't care, but it does get boring if i have to comment on my own stuff. Anywho...  So today I woke up at 1 in the afternoon, not good since I have a physics exam tomorrow, and i was planning on finishing my overdue CAPP projects that were due in like March or something. My counselor kinda hinted i wasn't going to graduate if i didn't hand that in soon.   Wow, summer is already upon us. Dyllan and them all at Palmer are already out of school, i mean, what's up with that? Stupid Richmond having to finish first. Well, I'm only a couple days behind, unlike poor McRoberts (who i feel very sorry for).   Work starts next week, and I really don't think much will change from this week. I only have a little bit of time before I have to go to work so summer for me might not even start until the All Nighter, which i still haven't beenable to book off yet. But yeah! Swimming on the 24th, thats gonna be fun. Anywho, duty calls...I'm probably gonna fail physics, why do i bother...

      I just finished the last Math class of my LIFE. I just finished the last Chem class of my LIFE. Man, that feels good.  Matt came to visit McRoberts today (as you already know). That was the only cool part of my day, besides falling on the floor and Anne helping me up. That was hard because we were laughing too much. Oh well.

      Well, today i learned many things, like how i hate stupid questions on Socials exams, but the one thing that really stuck out was the fear of McRoberts. Why? I dunno, It was like oh man, I'm an outsider! No one likes me!   Indeed that wasn't true, i mean, they don't even know me and i was there to see my friends, but whatever, a Robson thing i guess. It was really fun actually! I saw sooooo many new things! I saw all my friends and went into a diferent high school for my first time ever!!! Wow, that really was fun...The best part was going to Bio. Oh yes, you gotta love Bio, even though i've never taken it. I must say, Magee is still more cooler, not to start a controversy, but it's just so new and it's in da creme du la creme area! Anywho, if I wasn't so tired I probably would have had a much better time. My 2 disapointments, being extremly tired,and not seeing Brendan!!! Where was he!!!?!??!?!?!?! oh man, that was a disapointment indeed.  Ahhh McRoberts, what a nice school. You gotta love it, except for that freaky french vibe! And they fact there were video cameras...Ah yes, freaky video cameras and weird french vibes makes McRoberts my personal favourite school! No wounder, t's got some of my best and closests friends that I've ever had. Ahhhhhhh, that's what makes it so good...

      Alright! Socials didn't go too bad. I bombed one part, probably got like 2 outa 10, but otherwise, I'm ok, i hope...  Anywho, i was suposed to go visit the crew at McRoberts but because of studying and other things, cumincations got mixed up so here I am at home. If only I had my car...  Yay! Anne is in, now, we need to get Dyllan...yes Dyllan...So my damn Drama teachers weren't there so i didn't get my Bye Bye Birdie video. What robbery...Technology does suck too!!! Whatever, 2 more exams!!!! And what's up with da price of batteries??? Geez Loiuzze. Oh wait, I can't say that now that Anne's in, umm Geez Cheez. The is messed up...

      Wow, i love Rick Mercer, he makes me laugh like no other comedian. The best thing about it is that he's CANADIAN s it makes it okay to laugh. Anywho...  So yeah, did my english final today, saw no major problems, probably not perfect but i see no need to fail...good times. I'm gonna go for lunch soon, and just to let you know Steph, i haven't eaten much yet and my stomach has recovered. Man, i must have gained 20 pounds over this weekend.   I'm getting my Bye Bye Birdie Video Tomorrow!!!! We HAVE to watch it!! Hey! Maybe at the all nighter!! Wow...the posibilities are endless. HAHAHA!! Man, Rick Mercer kills me...

      Yesterday night I could not attend youth group, due to the fact that my church was having a surprise party for my dad. On account of it being the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a minister. He was so fooled, lol, it was great. It was so amazing to see how many people really love my dad. I guess I take for granted how amazing he is, so much appreciation. I'm so glad it happened, my dad really has been needing some encouragement lately. But it just really reminded me how cool my dad is, and how much I love him.

      I'm really angry right now. Partly because of a deal I had working with a friend. He's paying me to print off 500 copies of his band's CD, because I have a connection with a CD printing press. I called his house to update him and he wasn't home, but his mom wanted to speak with me, so she did. She made me feel like total crap. I hate that. When adults talk down to you. But whatever. I'm over it, sort've. I'll get the job done, he'll pay me and he'll get the CDs and I doubt I'll ever be working with them again. It's unfortunate because I really enjoy their music. But I don't need someone's mom telling me about the job I'm doing.  Bowling was fun tonight, don't you guys agree? Only, I was majorly disappointed with the lack of disco going on. And the fact that I got two strikes in a row at the END OF A GAME. They should've happened earlier on. Bummer. However, my spirits were uplifted during the sing and shout par-tay on the bus back to the church. Another thing that annoyed me though, is the new guys that were at the youth group. I'm all down for welcoming new people in the group and making new friends, but I thought it was so rude that they were abusing everything. Languages, attitudes, the church building... I'm trying not to make a big deal, but it bugs/hurts me so much to see someone yell something like, "Praise the Lord!" knowing that they don't care anything for the three words they just said. It really, really hurts.  I think I'm mistreating this website. I'm ranting too much. I'm sorry, continue.

      What the hec?!?!? Ten Bucks!!! To Go Bowling!????!!? Usualy i wouldn't be so mad, but a month ago, i asked if we could get the youth to come watch my play. I was told that 8 dollars was too much money to come see me. Were paying $10 to go bowling!!!!! That's $2 more to go bowling!!! What the hell? Seriuosly!!!! I mean, sure, 8 bucks is a rip off to go see a play, but I was in it!!! None of my friends from youth or Richmond came to see me!!! I felt really bad!! And the youth could have gone to see me but $8 was too much money!!! Whats more important? Suport from friends? or Bowling in the 70's? What ever happened to good old Lowis Lanes for 5 bucks or something? (That's right, Steph knows)But really, what a way to put me down. 8 bucks is too much to see me, but it's ok to pay $10 to go bowling. Wheres The Love...Where Is The Love....

      I had a cookie during the 15 minute break just now. And I had three cookies last night. That's four cookies within 24 hours! Intense...  Am I the only one who think it's a bummer that bowling this Friday costs $10? Did it use to be $4.75 or something? But then again, that was Lois Lanes. And apparently, we're going to the Zone this time. So I guess it'll work out eventually. Also noted in the Youth update/e-mail, there is, IN FACT, an all-nighter being planned for the 25th. My last exam is the day before. So I will have lots to celebrate. Who votes we play Cops  Robbers in the dark again, like last time? Dude, that was so rad.  My throat hurts. I really hope it's not sickness coming to steal me away right before exams. Let's hope I don't fall ill. That would suck a lot.

      I got a "service medallion" at the Awards Ceremony tonight. I tied for it with Krystyna Adams. Let's analyze this a bit: you've got your All-Canadian, straight-A, sports-lovin', ultimate robo-student and on then, on the flip side, you've got your slacker extradonaire. SERIOUSLY.   What's up with that?   P.S. Matt made me Admin (nah-nah) and so I changed the layout. This is just easier to read. I think. If you hate this, tell me.

      Guys, seriously, are you being serious?  It's ok to be semi-serious, but all of what you do must pertain to some level of seriousness. Seriously, if you don't get seriously serious, I will seriously kick the serious into your unserious asses!  But on a totally unserious note, I have this totally paradoxialseriosity blogsite called  urlLink  ranDOMinion . If you're clever, you'll find a seriously PHun gimick in the name. Go to  urlLink  ranDOMinion , leave comments, make fun of things or serious people, then come back and do it again (when there new posts, seriously sillies!).  I just wanted to seriously show Matt how dubiously unserious the matter of adding people to the blogger is. I will come back and write here at serious random intervals, as I am quite random at best when it comes to serious matters.   Peace! </post></Blog>
