						   If you're a female who worked for  urlLink Wal-Mart  between 1996 and 2001,  urlLink you can sue the uber-retailer . Here's what the Boys from Bentonville  urlLink had to say  about the deal.  What do you have to say?   OOOPS...don't sue about the boys from Bentonville thing...

						   It's a well-established personal rule that I only inhabit dance clubs if (a) I get in free. (b) I get to stand and drink beer in a VIP area and (c) there's a kick-ass DJ.  In other words, I don't club-hop often.  But last night I had a connection to a hot show at the Avalon in Hollywood, where the rapidly-developing-a-cult-following  urlLink D.J. Wolfie  was spinning.  But the highlight of the evening was  urlLink The Mutaytor , a percussion-stunt-dance ensemble that puts on a high-energy performance art-techno show.  Think Blue Man Group meets Cirque du Soleil.  Anyway, they have a bunch of shows coming up on the West Coast and I highly recommend them if you're in the area.   The Wolfie/Mutaytor bill sold out the 1,200-capacity Avalon, and 300 people were turned away.  So if you didn't have a VIP pass, it was a typical stand-all-night-in-line Hollywood evening.  I felt a little special...;) Oh, and I met one the girls from Survivor, but I've never seen Survivor so the brush with celebrity was completely lost on me until my date told me it was the girl from Survivor.  Whew.

						   so this man who writes this blog thinks american soldiers are heroes?  when they come home in a box and their mommies and daddies cry and and they have a big funeral their president doesn't attend?    i won't be throwing out that image of paul johnson.  the severed head will burn in my head as a symbol of the consequences of wanton murder and thievery, as it should for every american.  i came to the united states in 1998, to study religious studies on full scholarship at ucla.  i spoke not a word of english, and the americans looked down at me like i was their pet dog, running for a stupid stick in the park.  if you don't understand what song the stupid girl on american idol sings, they hate you.    after 9/11 i was persecuted for the color of my skin.  they didn't like brown folks.  i was held by homeland security when my phone records were traced to iraq.  they did full body cavity search.  and you americans think pain is rinsing your mouth too long with the listerine.    you heard it right.  i was born in iraq.  my parents still live there.  they'd love to join in this blog, but they've never used a computer.  i only lived in iraq until i was nine.  then i went to live with an uncle in england.  one brother came with me, two other brothers stayed in iraq.  they were killed by u.s. troops in this past year's fighting.  but i had not spoken to either of them in 17 years so it wasn't a crushing thing.  i did not stay in bed for 6 months and cry like a little baby and make people feel sorry for me like americans do when someone dies.  i only tracked my parents again in 1999.  i talk to them about monthly.  my father owned a store before the occupation.  now he has nothing.    was that so bad, blaine?  you were so afraid of a few empty threats...like americans who hide in their basements when they here the 2000 bug will destroy them.  i knew you would soil yourself at the mere thought of iraqi redemption.  but i am benevolent, not the opposite.  i live in los angeles and i lead a simple life, selling computer hardware. if blaine allows, and you all want, i will tell more.

						   So I got an e-mail regarding my first  urlLink post.   And I must admit, I was quite disturbed.  I never though this blogging thing would make my palms sweat and conjure thoughts of calling my parents to outline my funeral wishes ("H" by Tool during interment, for the record.)    I know, I know.  I'm anonymous.  There's nothing to be afraid of. Unless he secretly works for blogspot.     This goofball did, however, ask to write a guest blog.    Now, this proposal wedged me betweeen my desire to be heard and my desire to ignore frightening people who "hope (I) lock up tight and get police protection, cuz (he) knows (I'm) in the L.A. area and (he) will find (me) if (he) has to knock on 5 million doors."  Not a comfortable place.  But I gave in to the warm-and-fuzzies that accompanied the first time I saw "guest blog" and "Blaine's" in the same sentence.   I want this to be an open forum for the excahange of ideas, even if the first return salvo is some wacko fantasizing about all the ways he'd like to "skin (me) while I sleep, then toss (my) bones in with (his) morning broth".  Faris ("not like the lazy infidel bueller" he stresses) will make his Blaine's Hospitable Habitat debut some time in the next day or two.    I apologize in advance.  I encourage you all to ramp up the discourse here so that Blaine's may be home to less malevolent voices in the future.

						    urlLink Don't try it in Italy.   By the way, has anyone ever done this?  I'd love to hear a story, especially if you've gone as far as to download scanned test answers.  I mean, couldn't you just as easily open a book?

						   The Cubs have been the one constant in my short life.  From '83 on, from Buckner to Moreland to Moyer to Goose to Schiraldi to Wrona to Harkey to Scott to Treblehorn to Foster to Morandini to Gaetti to Brant to King to Stairs to Hundley, I've seen it all.  Yeah, the ugly ones stick the most.  But I've been to about 100 games at Wrigley.   urlLink Here's hoping  my kids will get to go to a few as well.

						   Get ready for a week of Paul Johnson still shots, superimposed by waving-in-slow-motion video of Old Glory. On some stations, they'll probably play God Bless America or The Star-Spangled Banner for effect.  In Dub-Ya's home state, they might play "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)."  A vaporous war has a new object of affection.  The masses will now be told to rally behind the headless body of Paul Johnson, images of which were downloaded today across corporate America like Paris Hilton tape stills.    I won't go the way of the heartless Reagan bashers and decry Paul Johnson's life's work.  I have too much respect for a human being and his grieving family.  But he worked for Lockheed-Martin, a central cog in the military-industrial complex that spurred America's push into Iraq, which spurred today's events.   Decide for yourself whether Paul Johnson was an American hero.  Don't let the faux-grievous news anchors make your mind up for you.  But before you choose to place this man on a pedestal and shake your fist toward the Middle East in his name, ask yourself:  was Ken Ballard a hero?  Bumrok Lee?  Todd Bolding?  Cody Calavan?  Bradli Coleman?  Daniel Eggers?  Aaron Elandt?  Benjamin Gonzalez?  Joseph Jeffries?  Markus Johnson?  Robert Mogensen?  Dominique Nicolas?  Charles Odums II?  Brian Ouellette?  Robert Scheetz Jr?  Dustin Sides?  Michael Wiesemann?  Nicholaus Zimmer?  Rafael Reynosa?  If you don't recognize any of these names, check out the June 6, 2004 obituaries in the  Los Angeles Times .  I'll tell you two things up front:  none of these men were older than 28.  And none of these men earned serving their country what Paul Johnson collected working for Lockheed-Martin.     I'm still waiting for their pictures on CNN, with nice digitally-rendered yellow ribbons tied around them.

						   So I socialized today. And yesterday. I got a couple e-mails inviting me to interesting little grad student and young professional thingsâa foreign film screening and a networking eventâso I got in my car and I drove there, like millions of people in L.A. do when a friend calls and tells them, hey, dude thereâs a neat screening of this really twisted Russian film, or hey, co-worker I have an occasional beer with after work, guess what, I heard about this get-together among people who work their ass off 40-50 hours a week at the same type of job we have and letâs go commiserate and talk about how much we hate our bosses and the petulance of the well-to-do American executive and hey, we might even make a good friend. Imagine that. A good friend. A new friend.    I get to the foreign film screening and no one is in the theater. Great, I think. Drove up here for nothing. Wasted all this gas. So glad I decided to socialize. Then I walk outside and see the grad students, playing a sun-splashed game of croquet on the University quad. Theyâre all tan and sweaty and red-faced on this dry-hot day, because dry-hot is the only way they can get hot and sweaty playing croquet. Theyâre also chasing each other around, playing flirtatious games with the croquet mallot. My good friend in the Dodger hat slides the nub in the performance artist girlâs butt-cleavage. Hysterical laughter ensues, and the faces get redder and everyoneâs having a great time and letâs reach in the big red cooler and get another beer and isnât it gosh-darn lovely to be 25 and still have care-free summers? And who the hell is this guy in the chinos and discount Kohlâs dress shirt?    âDude, arenât you hot?â offers my Dodger fan friend, barely recognizable, having grown a pillowy tuft of hair since I last saw him three months ago.    I grin sheepishly, nodding at the crooked wickets.    âLooks like something you do in the summer.â    Nobody gets my ironic attempt at humor. Yeah, dipshit, they all think, it does look like something you do in the summer. Thatâs why weâre doing it. Go back to your cubicle.    The foreign film is indulgent, like the moderator said it would be, and afterward everyone pairs off into the summer romances that have blossomed, and everyone asks me when Iâm graduating. Like they canât wait to get rid of me. Like they never had me. But then, how could they have ever had me? I sit behind a desk all day. I was lucky to make it to this screening on time at 7 p.m. They run in the park and wallow in the shade of California green tall spiky trees and feed each other grapes and wine and Miller Lite. They enjoy life. And I canât be their friends. Not unless theyâll carry a Blackberry around and check it regularly for the latest off-color e-mail forward, anyway.    So I socialized and had a crappy time and felt like a dad showing up early to pick his 13-year-old son from a testosterone-drenched sleep-over, one with Playboys and Ultimate Fighting and Hustlers and Bench Press Contests and Barely Legals. I was a stuffed-shirt spoiler. Maybe I needed to hang out with my element: work-a-holic twenty-somethings.    So the next evening I get in my good-times-mobile and head north again. I feel like a mouse in a maze trying to park in the cramped little beach town, but I finally slide into a curbside without red markings. On the way to the meeting place, I break a twenty at a dive bar and pound a Red Stripe, at once an attempt to avoid awkwardness in a group pay-for-the-check situation and an attempt to get a little buzz going before meeting a bunch of strangers.    But from the moment I shake Heidiâs hand, I know letting beer slip through my lips was akin to chugging a 40-ouncer before a basketball game. Networking is an endurance event, a discipline worth mastering. Drinking will throw you from your game. Heidi would know.    âIâve been networking and networking and networking,â Heidi says. âYou have to do it so hard-core. And here in L.A? Please. Itâs all about who you know. Itâs never merit. And believe me, I have merit. Hello? Berkeley grad. Hello? Held a mid-management slot in San Francisco. And these people are trying to look at me for entry-level work? Are they kidding me?â    Nobody else is any different, except a lovely undersized couple from a head-hunting firm literally trying to sell me. Everyone gripes about their current job and about how their tenacious networking has yet to pay off. My networking has yet to advance beyond hooking my DSL line up to the hub, so I guess Iâm in trouble. I wanted to have a few laughs, pick up some job leads, maybe, find a way out of my current hell-in-a-cubicle. All I got was a sales pitch and a twenty-minute sermon on forging connections and collecting as many business cards as you can from a girl who apparently didnât deem me worthy, because she left without requesting a business card. And then there was the girl I remembered from the last networking event I went to a year ago, who didnât remember me and seemed freaked out when I greeted her by name. Then she politely told me to take a hike, âGo talk to Larry and Davidaâ¦.they can help you find a better job.â In other words, go walk into a sales pitch. Youâre scaring me.    So after two days of flaunting my formidable social graces, itâs time for a consolation prize: a 40 of Mickeyâs. I pull into the Liquor store near home. Itâs an easy summer night and the tall, lean Armenian attendant I know too well stands outside. Must be slow in there. I feel a little uneasy walking past him, making him go back to work, becoming the only man in an empty temple of booze. But soon I have company.    âHey-ah, Dood, whasssup?â    Itâs a stumbling drunk in a blue hockey jersey. Heâs heading for the same cooler I am. I grab my Mickeyâs, expecting to hear a âGood call, dude,â but instead:    âAh, itâs Sarmuch, boy. Sarmush, how ya doinâ? Back here now, huh?â    Sarmuch the Armenian attendant nods politely, then walks towards the register to check me out.    âThey usually got you over on 4th and Ximeno now, huh?â hockey guy bellows, loud enough to crack a mini-bottle.    I donât care how Sarmuch responds. I am in the liquor store, joining a man, who so frequents the local liquor stores he notices when folks shift from site to site, in buying a 40-ouncer. Maybe  heâs  my kind of guy.

						   Like Joe Pesci mulling over his momâs Red Riding Hood painting, Iâm taking a long look like at the world and putting my own spin on things. Is this an original thing to do? Hardly.    But I canât help but look around. Granted, my view is considerably impeded by my cubicle. So Iâm really doing a lot of introspection. Which is what I believe what Pesci was doing in that very underrated scene.     Why am I such a hard guy to get along with?    Why does my roommate and best friend piss me off when he leaves cans and dirty plates out, when my room looks like a landfill the week after Christmas?    Why have I only cared about five women in the last four years?    Why have I met all of them on the Internet?    Why have none of the five women Iâve slept with in the last four years been any of the ones Iâve cared about?    Why did I meet all of them on the Internet?    Am I losing touch with reality?    Do I care about my job too much?    Then why do I feel like showering every evening when I cease my soulless desk-jockeying?    Do I care about writing too much?    Then why havenât I ever spent an entire eight hour day working on a piece?    Ever!    And Iâm borderline professional, people! Been published in newspapers and magazines and shit!    Whatever.    Iâm done.    Faris still wants to say something, but I gotta get a few posts up first. Hey, itâs my goddamn blog.

						    urlLink This  looks bad-ass.  And those crazies from  urlLink Mutaytor  will be there in all their glory, without fire marshalls doing things like making sure the building doesn't burn down.  There won't be a roof, a roof, so nothing will be on fire, kids.  Only the sticks the folks on stage are twirling and swallowing.    Unfortunately, BLaiNe has to work.  Happy  urlLink Blow-Shit-Off Day  to me.  Reports are welcome.  I need guest commentary...don't want to run one of the insipid columns I got from Faris.  He claimed to have channeled Sadaam this afternoon.

						    urlLink House Arrest ,  urlLink Season 2  episode 11  Tony's job stress, absurdly juxtaposed with the "pressures" faced by everyday schlubs in the garbage business, leads to another panic attack.    Junior is getting old and crusty, and the choices he made early in life are making his twilight a little more excruciating.    Dr. Melfi is losing control of her life and losing her son.  Tony drives her literally to drink, but she feels an intense need to understand this marvelously conflicted man who is suffering inside.  Kind of like how we chase dreams and obsessions and loves and fascinations even when they may not be in our best interests.  We just do.    And as a cherry on top, a cameo by  urlLink Terry Winter , the resident bad-ass writer who isn't named  urlLink David Chase .
