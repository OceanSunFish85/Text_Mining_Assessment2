       urlLink Avnet - Swiss Army Memory "Knife"   Yeah, I'm a tech geek, but this thing is pretty damn cool if you ask me.

      Don't you hate it when you've been working on a project for a long time and seem stuck in a rut on a seemingly tough portion of it only to have someone who has not put in any time or effort come over and say "Oh, if you did X, Y, and Z you'd be all set." Arrrgggh! Well, it happened to me this morning.   I've been trying to design a hard stop for a tilt drive we have and have been running into failure issues due to the high torque on the thing. My boss comes over and asks for an update - so I run him through everything and then tell him where I'm having issues. Then he goes "Well, what if ou modify the gear so that it's impossible for it to rotate past a certain point."  Duh! I've been staring at this thing for a week, running all kinds of funky calculations, doing all kinds of funny number crunching and then he comes over and solves it in five minutes. So freaking irritating. But, at the same time, it's a great idea that I would have missed - I knew I was looking too closely at this thing.  But, hey, it's Friday and it's almost lunch time, so things can't be that bad today. I can't wait to get out of here. We're going to see  Bourne Supremacy  tonight. I can't wait. It looks awesome. Then we're heading down to Jersey tomorrow to see Brent and Christy. Should be a fun time. Alright, enough blogging...time to get back to work here...

      The last few days have been hellish here...I've been dragging my butt around work without much of anything doing. My projects have all kind of stalled and I don't feel like I have the energy to jump start them. Weird kind of funk I'm in. Work is once again becoming that place I go to just because I'm  supposed  to be working - it's the thing I  should  be doing simply because of where I am in life...well, what if I don't want to do that? What if I want to stay home and not work? Just me being me right now, I guess....one of my typical funks. I'm sure the fact that I haven't been the gym in a long time and I'm mentally battling the need to have a  proper  diet with the desire to eat like a  normal  person (one a side note, I sure am using italics a lot today). OK, enough dinking around...maybe I can get some work done if I leave this be for a while...

        Well, it was my Mom's B-Day yesterday and it's been about a month since we saw them, so we're heading up to MA this weekend to see them. Ris' parents will be in Newport, RI (a short drive from my folks' house), so it looks like the whole gang will get together (as Courtney will be with Mike and Fredda and Alyssa  Z are coming down from VT as well). Sat AM is golf for the boys and then everyone's off to Newport for dinner. Hopefully the weather holds out for us. It's not looking good so far :

       I spent 1.5 hours (6:30 - 8:00pm) surfing. Chest to head (occassional overhead) high waves. Almost to the point of being too big for my ability. Paddling out was a chore and a half (say what you want, but it's a killer back/shoulder/arm workout). Not as glassy conditions as this weekend. It was much rougher (probably due to onshore wind). Also closed out a bit quicker so we had a steeper face. You feel like you're going to "fall" into the wave. I caught my fair share and decided to quite while I was ahead. Damn near ran over a little kid on a boogie board and then got snaked on three or four waves because a noob girl was sitting in front of my line and not even trying to catch a wave. Oh well, we all learned at some point. I'm still learning. But, to be honest, it was far too big and hairy to be out there if you don't at least have an inkling of what your doing...     I've basically come to the conclusion that I'm going to surf any day I can. I've got all winter to be in the gym. Surfing is such a release for me and it's just too damn fun to pass up. Especially when we're getting good swell. I'll be on and off at the gym until about mid-October. Hey, it's not like I don't get a good workout doing it.

       urlLink Surf Info Page Reports  This is a great page for surf reports in my area...good to know about too since surf is going off lately.   If I can ever figure out the links part of this page, I'll add to it :)

       Well, back to work on this dreary Monday. I spent the weekend at the beach with the Mrs. and our good friends the Murrays. We had an absolute blast. The sailboat got all painted (and ready to sail from whatI hear), but the surf was up, so I spent my time on the beach side and not at the bay. Only downside to the weekend was that I lost my wedding ring while paddling into a wave. It was a most unfortunate happening as we haven't even been married for a month. Fortunately, Ris was very understanding and didn't freak out on me. I've got a ring on order now (hopefully it'll be here by Thursday) and all is good.     Work, however, is bland...as usual.

      Hurricane Alex is sending some love our way.  Report has it at overhead (and then some), glassy, and pretty much perfect.  Too damn bad I'm stuck here at work w/little to no time off left on my account.  I'm bummed out big time.  I decided to not get wet yesterday due to the fact that Ris had a bad day at work yesterday (How someone can threaten to "fucking kick her ass" in regards to their boss - in front of two other managers, mind you - and not be fired is beyond my comprehension.  Unions are pathetic wastes of space these days).  So, instead, I went home, did laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, and generally took care of her.  She appreciated it, but still, I missed a day of surfing - BOOO!  Hopefully I'll get wet tomorrow (as today is a gym day - and probably a little too big for me anyways).
