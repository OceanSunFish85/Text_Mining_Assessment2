      For the last two days, we have had a monsoon cloud cover in Jaipur. Nothing like the ones in Assam or the Western Ghats, still, it has been such a relief from the searing heat and humidity for several days earlier. Don't really know how long it wil persist but prayers, even official, are being sent incessantly. However, agriculture experts believe that the damage has already been done because the showers didn't arrive in time for the sowing season.

      Recently, I met the director of the  urlLink South Asian Cinema Foundation  and we spoke at great length about flims. The man, Lalit Mohan Joshi, said that Indian films (for many read as Bollywood) lack quality content and social relevance. He urged directors to pick up subjects that have an undercurrent of realism. But again, the game is not won just by picking up such a subject. Talking about Girlfriend (a recent Bollywood film on lesbians), it was felt that sensitivity and subtlety are equally important. Here is the piece I wrote for the paper:A failed attempt at acting in a Shyam Benegal film did not douse Lalit Mohan Joshiâs fascination for Indian films. âThe seed did not die,â recollects Joshi. Gradually, over the years, that âseedâ germinated into the South Asian Cinema Foundation (SACF), an organisation dedicated to portraying a âwhole pictureâ of Indian cinema in the UK and elsewhere.Formerly a journalist with the Hindi service of the BBC, Joshi says SACF seeks to correct the âmyopic western perception of Indian cinema as either Satyajit Ray or rubbishâ. Neither is it something âhighbrow or elitistâ. âWe want to use cinema as a tool to empower the people, especially the South Asians in the UK,â he adds. Co-founded in 2000 with Derek Malcolm, The Guardian film critic, SACF brings out an annual thematic journal on Indian cinema (the latest one is on Partition films) and holds regular events aimed at sensitising the UK to films that go beyond Bollywood â a term that many think encompasses the entire range of Indian films. Just like many here in India would associate English films produced outside the US as Hollywood productions.And one of the films, also one of his personal favourites, that Joshi has tucked into his quiver is V Shantaramâs 1937 classic âDuniya Na Maneâ. The film portrays a woman who is married to man as old as her father and how she struggles to change her fate. âWe screened it and people were amazed to see a woman oppose the marriage without being very loud. Such a situation (as the plot) still exists amongst several South Asians in the UK,â says Joshi.A far cry from the âsocially relevantâ films of yore, he feels that there is a âcrisis of content and social relevanceâ in Indian films now. âNot that I am denying Bollywood its importance, but look at Mohabbatein. It features a gurukul in Wiltshire with students eating Pringles chips and girls in short skirts. Whom are they trying to fool,â Joshi asks. âInstead, cross-cultural films like Bend it Like Beckham are playing a much better role than nonsensical Bollywood films,â he adds. Tracing the crisis to the 70âs, Joshi says that the crisis still continues with âdecliningâ social values and directors being undermined by commercial forces. âDirectors must take up socially relevant subjects. If Ram Gopal Varma decides to make a such a film, money would surely pour in,â Joshi says. With all his love and frustration for Indian films, he feels that Indian films and filmmakers are headed for a brighter tomorrow where regional films would also gain more importance. âThere are many Shekhar Kapurs simmering in India,â Joshi adds.

       John Kerry, John Edwards and Jaipur â The connection might seem vague in reality but in the unpredictable world of cyber crime the three fall into place. SurfControl, an American Internet security firm, on Thursday blew the lid off two phishing scams in the US that were soliciting funds from Internet users, claiming they would be used to finance the political campaign of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming US presidential election.One of these sites,  urlLink www.yahoogoogle.biz , was found to be registered in Jaipur.   Moments after the beans were spilt, these sites folded leaving cyber crime experts fumbling in the dark about their identity or the amount of money they could have amassed since they went online around the date of the Democratic Convention in Boston.But why Jaipur of all places? In an email interview with Hindustan Times, the SurfControl vice president Susan Larson wrote that many American spammers host their operations outside the US to circumvent the law there. âMoreover, certain countries, including India and Thailand, have become popular destinations because the overhead costs are considerably lower than in the US,â she said.Because SurfControlâs primary responsibility is to identify and classify spam, the nature of the siteâs work is still in the dark. For example, it is still unclear whether the site had any physical presence in this city and how many people were involved. There are reports that Kerry-Edwards Campaign did contact the US Department of Justice. Concerned authorities in Jaipur are clueless about any such event. Considering they had a presence in Jaipur, Larson mentioned that it is âlikely that few, if any, of the funds were diverted to Indiaâ.Each site has to be registered against a name and physical address. However, many choose to base their sites outside the US to exploit loopholes in the US CAN-SPAM law and other national laws that have no international provisions. So the possibility that the spammer had some fascination for Jaipur remains open because of his choice of city. Larson stressed that international cooperation is one of the keys to establish effective anti-spam and anti-phishing legislation. (eom)What is phishing?Phishing attacks use 'spoofed' e-mails and fraudulent websites to fool recipients into divulging personal financial data such as credit card numbers and account usernames. By hijacking trusted brands, well-known banks, online retailers and credit card companies, phishers are able to convince up to 5% of recipients to respond to them. Once such private information is in their hands, these scamsters make purchases, withdrawals and the like on accounts of the unsuspecting users. Source:  urlLink www.antiphishing.org

      Despite possessing âattractiveâ infrastructure availability for ITES-BPO firms, Jaipur is âunattractiveâ when it comes to local industry support groups and the knowledge base generated. This is what the recent National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) and KPMG study has to say about Jaipur. It acknowledges the efforts made by various stakeholders in the IT sector but adds that âthese were not balanced and lacked follow-through actionâ.The report, that studied 13 cities, was carried out as an âanticipatory managementâ step to fill in the information gaps as ITES firms begin expanding to second-rung cities, chiefly to contain the high levels of attrition in the existing major BPO centres. It is being circulated to member firms and is available for purchase.In the human resources section, the report prescribes an âattitudinal change to gain greater acceptance of the ITES-BPO cultureâ. Parents of prospective employees, it adds, have to be comfortable with their children, especially their daughters, working on night shifts. It also notes that the average salary for this sector ranges between Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,500 per month, which is about 30 per cent lower than Gurgaon. Further, low attrition rates hovering below 10 per cent add to the low cost of managing resources. Also, most of the work in Jaipur is at the lower-end comprising medical transcription, outbound collections and some inbound support. Interestingly, it also notes that English may not be the âpreferred languageâ as only about three theatres out of nearly 25 screen English films and only one English newspaper is printed locally. However, it adds that Jaipur produces 450 MBAs, 100 CAs and 5,500 engineering graduates each year. Case studies of GECIS and Supportscape, a local call centre, are also featured, including their comments on working out of Jaipur.Under infrastructure, it points out Jaipurâs âfavourableâ situation with ITES-BPO firm being charged low rates at Rs 3.6 - Rs 3.8 per unit. Developed property for tech firms is also available at rent for about Rs 45 per sq ft per month. The report mentions better roads, low housing costs, the ADB-supported infrastructure development programme, the premier hotels and clubs in the city and good schools in the city.In the tech side, it points out that Jaipur has optical fibre cables and satellite connectivity of over 163 mbps but most of it remains underused. It also sounds a note of caution that promoters are âactively consideringâ alternative locations for their new bases because of the restraints that this city faces.
