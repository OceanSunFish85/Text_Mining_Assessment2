      Wow what a disappointment... I just  knew  night #2 would offer a drunken enraged Kennedy, an unhinged  urlLink ARRRRGHHHH  Howard  urlLink ARRRRGGGHHHGHG  Dean, and some in your face remarks from Teresa Heinz that would be noteworthy... Sadly for me the combination oflocking the liquor cabinet in Kennedy's room, the lithium for Dean, and the realization that Teresa's mouth could blow her husband's campaign, seemed to keep everyone in check. If  urlLink Dan Rather calls it a bore , then you know it must be a bore. It has been widely reported that the Democratic party is not really excited by Kerry, although they are united to remove Bush. I think that was very apparent last night.     To be fair, due to some work I was doing, I ended up listening to the speeches, rather than watching, other than for Ted Kennedy (who looked surprisingly sober!), so it might have been MUCH more exciting on the TV..... Don't roll your eyes at me! I did say "might".     Tonight was a lot of the same old same old, other than Barack Obama. I truly hope that his message and his approach becomes their party norm. He is the only speaker I listened to that didn't make me shutter, and didn't make me want to kick my dog. OK, I don't reallyhave a dog. Regardless, he is obviously the Democrats' new golden child, and with good cause. He radiates charisma. He is not only black, but white too! With immigrant roots? Can this be? His message lacks the shrillness that is the defacto standard of the rest of the party, and it is obvious that we will be seeing more of him in future years, barring some scandal getting in his way. It would have to be a pretty damn big one though, considering that both an impeached adulterer and a drunken manslaughterer were at the podium prior to him.     The award for most ironic message of the night must surely go toKennedy.I absolutely couldn't believe his comments abouthow we used to live in a time were kings passed on their role to their sons withoutany regard to whether they had merited it. He compared Bush to a   monarch named George who inherited the crown  . See  urlLink glass houses . Of course he continued a common theme that the Republican party is driven by division.   They know that we are weaker when we are divided   (poor paraphrasing). He spoke about how the Republican party pits blacks against whites, rich against poor, gays and against straights, and urban areas against super...sup... .... suburbs. I didn't think he was going to get that last one out. Damn teleprompters.     Are the followers of the Democratic party so blind to see that it is their leaders who not only constantly point out these divisions, but base their whole stance on them? John Edwards has been touring the country with his "Two Americas" stump speech for months now. Can someone please get the memo to him that he might want to change that up before the convention? Nah... won't matter. So far all speakers other than Obama have broken everyone up into segments and have pitted them against each other. They can (and are doing so) speak in one sentence about the right dividing the country, then in the next, talk about the unfairness that rich people aren't forced to give more of their money to the poor.     Dick Gephardt was another snoozer... and wait... this just in: The sky is blue. I did think one of his best lines was   there  is  a candidate who understands middle class squeeze  . OK wait a minute. Can someone please explain to me how someone who has more money than anyone I have ever even met in my life can possibly relate to middle class squeeze? There is no possible way he can possibly relate to middle class squeeze any more than I can riding an $8000 mountain bike or having to decide which jet I am going to take today. How have the Democrats convinced their followers that they are right there in the trenches with them? Of course, Gephardt did stay true to the theme of the convention with   I know that words can be cheap in a political year, but we need john kerry because we need a uniter, not a divider in the White House.   And at the completion of that statement the price of words just dropped $1.75.     Tom Daschle... I am pretty sure my favorite comment from him was that we need someone who will make sure   our allies will do their fair share to honor their commitments to our veterans  . OK look... I have never claimed to be a smart guy so I don't mind asking for help on this one. Someone... please.... explain.     Carol Moseley Braun? Well nothing real revolutionary here... division, catering to the rich... blah blah blah. However, one comment stuck out. She said that   those Vietnam veterans hold a special place in my, and I think all, of our hearts.   Yup those war mongering baby killers sure are special guys. We have always treated them great!     One thing that was kind of nice from last night was if you missed Clinton's speech on Monday, was that Janet Napolitano gave a knock off reprisal of it. Do you think she had to pay Bill royalties for the 'send me!' stuff? (note to self... go register sendme.com today)     Lastly, this was the first I have ever heard Teresa Heinz outside of sound bites. Surprisingly she is just as hard to listen to when you hear her in full context. She did, however, tell us that   With John Kerry as President, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed.   I am at least relieved to know thatJohn has figured out a way to stop a natural cycle of the earth that has existedsince it's creation. With that kind of power, he is surely the right man for the job.In all seriousness though, it was impressive how many languages she used in a single speech. I am sure that abilityhas been a very valuable asset to her in communicating with the help all these years.     Well, the grand finale is edging nearer... I am not sure what I am looking forward to most. I think the news that Nader is going to be on the floor with a press pass is most intriguing. Oh yeah... and that guy John is supposed toshow up... oh yeah and that otherJohn.

      Love him or hate him, you can't deny that Clinton is a master at working people. The looks on the faces of the audience was a collective thought of   How can I get stains on my blue dress  . If I was an uneducated, uninformed, undecided watching last night, I would likely be in Kerry's camp today.    That said... They don't even make boots tall enough to wade through the crap that was spewed last night.   You hear from the other side that we are a divided country...   Huh?!?! What???I thought   We area divided country   was their slogan!  In fact, I am certain that I heard Gore make that exact statement earlier in the evening. Bill of course followed this with   they need us divided, we want us united   or something very close to it. Are you kidding me?!?! Shortly after, Clinton began talking about how the wealthy are catered to by the right and the poor are left to fend for themselves, which would never be construed as divisive or anything.    I am not even sure I can continue... from crying that people that don't pay taxes didn't get a tax rebate in the mail to the ever friggin' tired whining about the 2000 election.    And don't get me started on Gloria Feldt, the president of Planned Parenthood. Oh Lord... She actually compared the War in Iraq to the  war being waged against womens' right to choose  ( to kill children  was implied).   And this is a war that we cannot afford to lose  , as opposed to that silly little war with those misunderstood Jihadist that are trying to wipe us out. Another golden moment from her speach was   If you have never made choice a deciding factor in an election, this is the year .  Thanks for the tip... will do. And have you noticed it is no longer abortion rights? It is now the innocuous "reproductive rights". Speaking of, have you seen this?  urlLink  http://store.yahoo.com/ppfastore/ihadabt.html  .    And Carter... oh man... Carter. The man has really come full circle for me. From ass, to "he's really not that bad of a guy", to complete ass again. ...  our credibility has been shattered and we are left increasingly isolated and vulnerable in a hostile world .  Oh wait, maybe I misread that. I didn't realize that was a reference to his party. Carry on.  OK last thing before I just lose it...    CSPAN talking about the speakers early in the evening...   And later we will have Al Gore, winner of the popular vote in the 2000 election  . Of all the ways that you could describe him, they decided that would be the most appropriate. No agenda there.    Enough... I need coffee.

      Well, I had to step away...  The Democratic Convention just got absolutely ridiculous. I could write no further after Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton hit the stage. Once John Jerry "reported for duty", I realized that there were just not words to describe the lunacy that I had witnessed....  That said, I picked up the following post from a local Jeep enthusiast board that I follow. I thought it was worth sharing to whoever may stumble here:       Time for one of my not-so famous rants, society has pissed me off to the point of becoming violently editorial once again.  I am convinced that the language barrier is a prime driver in the continuing decay of our countryâs business infrastructure. I offer the following experience for your consideration.  I went up to the local Texaco station this week having seen their Western Union Kiosk. I needed to wire some money to a friend. The kiosk has a phone which is a âhot lineâ to the Western Union operator â pick up the phone and you are connected.  The simplicity ended there.  I was connected to the Western Union operator who spoke with such a strong Latin accent as to prevent me from understanding half of what she was saying. I had to spell every word, âMark [last name removed]â, âTexasâ âFlower Moundâ, etc. A transaction which should have taken 3 minutes took 10. I was frustrated, but OK â I figured I would get done, get a 6 pack of adult beverages and split. I was wrong.  Then it got bad â phase two.  Phase two of a Western Union wire transfer is to pay the person at the checkout the dollars to be wired, plus the fee. I had $350.00, the fee was $36.00, leaving $314.00 for the actual transfer (highway robbery, but that is another story) amount. I wrote all of these figures on a Western Union provided slip of paper, complete with little boxes for each amount. The Middle Eastern gentlemen at the counter, who has worked there quite a while did not understand what to do. He asked me 6 times what the numbers were, repeatedly clearing out the credit-card style computer attached to the printer for this system. Eventually, he gets it input. Now, he has to select the pending transaction at his store for transmission. He canât read the name on the display and begins his own version of hooked on phonics which was more painful for me than you can imagine. Our language was being terrorized.  Worst part was that there was only one damn pending transaction.  Now, he starts trying to feed the receipt paper into the printer. He puts it in crooked 5 times, I can see from 20 feet away what the problem is, and I offer advice. He canât understand what I am saying so he continues to do it wrong. A line of people 10 deep has formed, so I asked him to wait on them so they can be on their way; somehow feeling responsible for their plight. He waits on them, plus the 6 or so more people who come in. I waited for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, the transaction times out of the system.  At this point, I had gone as far as I have patience to go, so I asked for âMy damn money backâ. A woman standing the line with her bag of Doritos, a Ding Dong, and a Diet Coke informed me that I was rude. I informed her calmly that although I could see why she might way that, I had been here for a half hour now trying to accomplish a 5 minute wire transfer. The clerk gives me my money and says, âtry back in a whileâ, I asked how âa whileâ would change the fact that he was unable to operate the equipment, or to speak English. I then suggested he take down the Western Union sign until he could master the intricate process of operating equipment designed to be understood by a 12 year old. The money didnât make it. What does this say for the state of our business infrastructure? We have systems whose front end is literally âEnglish as a second languageâ â can we survive like this? Called Sprint PCS lately? The electric company? All the same. And just wait till VoIP technologies become practical enough to take support of these systems off shore in the fashion IT call centers are following. Your "Good Neighbor" who answers the phone at the Insurance Company may be in Mumbai, India. Furthermore, the taxes that are being lost because of problems in our commerce systems are still being spent to support people who have no job, no insurance, and no intention to secure either.  See you at the Polls. Iâm considering a platform based on a TVA style work program. Except this time, we arenât building dams and bridges.  Future Excerpt from the Dallas Morning News Job Classifieds  12,000 strong men and women needed for fence construction. Must be tolerant of hot temperatures, and able to work long hours for a fair wage. Apply at your local Job Force Office.  Is isolationism the only hope?  MWC
