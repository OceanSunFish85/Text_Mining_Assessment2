      o man. its the last day of crew. couldnt be happier or saddier.  Love those people with all my sweat. can you say skatahh?  off to there right now in fact. to go sweat my balls off and get tortured one more time. some last words (ian anderson) Really don't mind if you sit this one out.  My words but a whisper -- your deafness a SHOUT. I may make you feel but I can't make you think. Your sperm's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink. So you ride yourselves over the fields and you make all your animal deals and your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick. And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away in the tidal destruction the moral melee. The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers the newfangled way. But your new shoes are worn at the heels and your suntan does rapidly peel and your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.  And the love that I feel is so far away: I'm a bad dream that I just had today -- and you shake your head and say it's a shame.  Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth. Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth. Spin me down the long ages: let them sing the song.  See there!  A son is born -- and we pronounce him fit to fight. There are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night. We'll make a man of him put him to trade teach him to play Monopoly and to sing in the rain.  The Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water -- as the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea. The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other -- as the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed. The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling -- but the master of the house is far away. The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding in the sharp and frosty morning of the day. And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.  And the youngest of the family is moving with authority. Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside.  The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea: the builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose and contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need. The young men of the household have all gone into service and are not to be expected for a year. The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster -- has formed the plan to change the man he seems. And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.  And the oldest of the family is moving with authority. Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run.  What do you do when the old man's gone -- do you want to be him?  And your real self sings the song. Do you want to free him? No one to help you get up steam -- and the whirlpool turns you `way off-beam.

       98 degrees and rising. a day in which every article of clothing you are wearing sticks to you lick a bug ti fly paper. yeah to quote my really cool sister "Today in school it was so hot that my entire body melted and slid onto the floor and stuck there in this big, gummy mess." shes cool. crew. ugg what can i say.  rowing is beautiful. and it is an amazing thing just to be out on a lake (even greenwood lake) and feel the power of your body becoming one with the water.  but... being on the team sucks. it runs my effing life. i can never do anything cause i have crew. and dr hoverman can be a dick. today he yelled at me for diving off the bridge and said "thats unpermissable!" it was fucking hot out. what an uptight bastard doctor.  but its all good. im happy cause i just remembered the name of the the string orchestra in Waking Life and i burnt their cd. well its really the waking life soundtrack. buts its so goood. i feel like i should be sipping coffe in a cafe in france and sharing my snotty outlook on life with my dog in a sweater.  but thats just me

       man... im so sick of school its not even funny. theres only like 4 weeks left or something? w/e its 4 months toooo long. and 3 more years will be unbearable. Im so glad that i have good friends or else there would be no reason to go.  except music class. I love too sing. I dont even really mind old heller woman. she bugs me but at least we sound good.  I skipped engilsh the other day to go to chorus and 3 teachers who have no connection to mr lewis asked me where i was. thats creepy. but w/e. meisters is a fun class. i love those people more than anything. some less than others but nothing serious. man o man am i gunna miss those seniors. there will never be another class like them. yeah and i always forget that jon is a junior so i wont be losing him. actually not many people are leaving. hmm. but w/e. god i say whatever alot. sheesh dont read this.  id delete it but thats to much work. shit speaking of work im late.

       Hair flying in the breeze, the boy clung to the last cars ladder. Insired by the music of the night, he let out a gleeful yell. His sounds mingled with the constant rattling of the train tracks, and the gentle, melodic humm of his guitar strings in the breeze. Wind and branches whistling past his face, he looked down at the quickly disapearing ground making way for new earth, every second closer to home than the next.  An sad old man sits in his car waisting precious life waiting for this train. A smile breaks across his nostalgic face as the last car and its human barnacle sing by, waving.   Suddenly the world feels all right.

      when will the insanity end!  school is just getting more intense as im getting relaxed. no funn. no funn at all. but its crazy hot out. sometimes. the other days its craazy cold. Hmmm. no wonder no one ever posts comments, cause im so damn boring. i just talk about nothing. arg. w/e. Here. Ryan Starks and i are playing an acoustic show at the tuscan cafe on July 2nd at 7 30. Were hoping that ms Emily Beyer will come and perform with us too, cause she makes us sound 10,000,000 times better.(and adds some class too lol) but hopefully jared will hit a couple songs with us and maybe the Jiminator. ol jimmy boyce is pretty pissed i think, cause we always play acoustic shows without him. i dunno, i love the jim but i dont think bass is what you need in acoustic songs.  i wasnt even a fan off the bass part mike G added to our damien rice stuff. but w/e. thats my personal opinion though. i really hope that ryan doesnt want to dump jimmy and use mike, cause jimmy knows our stuff, wrote aloit of the stuff, is really good, and started the effin band. If ryan says anything im gunna give him a peice of my mind. lol but its all cool. i dont think there will be a problem. Whew, im sweatin in here. i wanna go swimming? think my fish ponds deep enough...
