      The other night i watched my movie i recently bought,  City of God , with a few friends. I have talked with a number of people about the movie and have heard different responses to the content. My thoughts?... First of all, let me preface it all with the fact that i am not always the best person to ask about movies.Secondly,i think i will use this time todiscuss more about the subject of being"hardened",than write a review about a movie. Reviews are so relative to the viewers, so it seems best to reveal myself as a viewer, or listener, or reader.I think of myself being "hardened" to a lot of subjects. One of them is violence. I am not really sure why this is. I have not ever been at war, never shot anyone and have not been aprofessional wrestler or anything like that. However, I  have  been involved in violence a few times in my life. And i have been exposed to things that i believed have hardened me.   When i was a kid, i used to get in all kinds of fights. Some of them were rather brutal. I remember when i was in the fourth grade, i was riding my bike around witha friend. We were riding in a neighborhood that we usually didnt go into. That neighborhood had a posse of its own, like all neighborhoods do in suburbia. We rode up to them. There were about six kids hanging around a park that were all about our same age and they each had their own bikes. There was an older kid hanging with them who was probably in 6th or 7th grade, and at our age we all looked up to him.He was a guy that everyone knew, and we approached the posse because we knew him. I say that we knew him,but i learned that day that he wasn't really our friend.He wanted us (me in particular...i have yet to understand why)to fight. We looked up to him, like i said, and the peer pressure of him was a big factor. But it wasn't really peer pressure, it was more of the longing to be known, by him, by someone older that we respected. I did not have any reason to fight though. I can't just start fighting with someone by telling myself to fight. I have a temper, and my fighting mode is triggered by my temper. So i told them, that i dont have any reason to fight. (My temper was not engaged.) So then, some kid about my size, although slightly more lean, came over and pushed me off my bike. It wasn't a gentle, playful push, it was a dramatic, full-thrust push of violence. I fell off my bike hard. My temper was clicked on. And so i fought.I essentially rushed him and tackled him to the ground where we wrestled around, throwing the occasional punch. I finally got him in a head lock where i held him until he pretty much started crying and begged me to let go. I did. One down. Then another kid walked over and we started fighting. It was a lot of kicks and punches and blocking punches and dodging and grunting. (Although kids of that age don't really grunt.) At one point we were in a lock and i was hurting. He knew some tactical skills. I remember asking while locked: "You know karate" He responded: "Yea" And then we broke away and continued. He eventually landed an alwful hard punch/slap on my ear. For those of you that know me, know that i have sensitive ears. I had tubes in my ears when i was a kid and countless ear infections. I even had my eardrum blown out once. When he hit me, that was the second time. I fell to the ground and started crying. The pain was unbelievable. I crawled back to my bike and rode home, bawling in humility all the way. When i got home i ran to my mom and cried in her arms. She was always the one i went crying to when i lost a fight.   Another time, when i was in 8th grade, i went to a summer camp for boy scouts. At the time i was the Senior Patrol leader. For those of you that were never in Boy Scouts, the Senior Patrol leader is the leader of the whole troop. They are elected democratically, with nominations and a final vote. I was elected unanimously and was rather respected. Four of us went to this camp in Wente, California a week early to get some leadership training and such. We were sharing a camp from a group of inner city Boy Scouts from LA. They were all black kids, that probably  did  shoot people and such. It was a "privilege" to be out there for them. The four of us from our troop were living in two canvas-platform tents in their camp. Their leader was a guy who had joined the peace corps or something and was somewhat watching us for that week too. But he pretty much let us do what we wanted, we were pretty responsible. One morning, my tentmate, Billy Bracco, woke me up and said that they (the inner city kids) were throwing rocks at us. Right as he said that, a few rocks flew in....a big one. I am generally pretty passive...Like i said...Without my temper, i am a lamb. I went out back of the tent and was taking the morning leak, when a jagged rock about the size of a plumb hit me right on the side of the face where ones temple is located. It's sting turned me into full rage. My temper guided it. I ran after the kid with super human speed in nothing but my boxers. I chased him for a few hundred yards into a tent. I tackled him in there and started beating him up pretty bad. He was curled up on the wooden floor of the tent while i punched him a few times, then i got up and started kicking him many times. He started crying and i let up. I told him i was sorry and walked back to my tent wondering how i just did a thing like that. My face was covered in blood and it ran down my cheeks and chin. I had a scar from that rock the size of a plumb for about a year.   There are other stories like that, i could tell, but i think you get the point. I haven't had my temper be triggered for a long time. I am thankful too. I remember in high school, i was always afraid something would trigger it and i would get into a big fight. In high school, fights mean a lot more things. For one, they draw crowds of hundreds. Two, people can get really hurt. Three, people take revenge. Four, the repercussions for your actions in high school are serious. I started to play football to vent my rage. I think it worked, because i never really got into a fight. But i say with a smile that i was the lightest linemen in our school at about 150 lbs. Starting every game as guard or tackle.   On top of the fights, i read a lot. Anyone who reads a lot will become hardened i believe. You get to this point where you just read the words and imagine the scenes and they become normal. I have read some really disturbing books, including a lot of books about war. There is the classic, Red Badge of Courage, there is Catch-22 (which is really more funny than anything), there is Brave New World, Slaughterhouse Five, Heart of darkness, Shakespeare's plays, Of Mice and Men, This Boy's Life, Where the Caged Bird Sings, The Hatchet, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, Once and Future King, Arctic Explorations, The Pearl, The Grapes of Wrath, Dog Song, Lord of the Flies, Mambas and Man-Eaters(an autobiography byC.J.P Ionides), In Pharaoh's Army (by Tobias Wolff about Vietnam), Roots, The Long Walk, Into the Wild, not to mention short stories by Carver. All these books have hardened me in some way, often to violence and abuse. I think this plays a big factor to being hardened to subject.   Then, there are movies. I have seen an awful lot of movies. Movies definitely harden people up to the visual images of subjects, whether it be violence, sadness, adultery, warfare, and countless other things. If you know someone who is a huge movie person, ask them about hardening.   I have to mention one other thing. That is my history of fishing and hunting. As long as i have been old enough to remember, i have gone fishing with my Grandpa. You are there to kill. You are there to catch with violence and kill. And its fun. Maybe some people think its not fun and they would cry with sorrow. But i think its fun, its been fun as long as i can remember. You catch the fish and reel it in, and you have to rip the hook out of its mouth. Maybe it helps people to know that fish cant feel pain. But for me, it seems natural. I have always eaten all the fish i ever kept, and there is something human in catching fish and killing them. Then cleaning them. Its a bloody violent act. You chop off their heads with large knives and hammers. There is crunching and slipping as you try to succeed. Then you rip open their belly and pull out all their insides with your fingers. The only time i have every felt sympathy is when the stomach is full of eggs. I also had good friends growing up that were hunters. I never killed any fowl or mammals, but i went with them a lot, just to hang out. I tend to believe that anyone who hunts and fishes is very hardened to violence.   And you know, today i was reading the Bible, reading 1 Samuel. Samuel was a prophet of God. He was essentially a priest, a traveling hermit who was very Godly. There is a scene in 1 Samuel, where Samuel gets word from God to tell Saul " 'I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself againstMe on the way while he was coming up from Egypt. Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' " Saul does not kill them all though. So Samuel comes and rebukes Saul, then " Samuel said, 'Bring me Agag, the kind of the Amalekites.' And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, 'Surely the bitterness of death is past.' But Samuel said, 'As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.' And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal."  Interesting.   And an essay later, i go back to the movie. As far as the movie goes. I liked it. Was it violent, yes. Did i have disgusted looks on my face when i saw some of the violence, yes. Did i close my eyes a few times so not to harden me further, yes. Would i tell my mom to see it, probably not. Did i cry when a little boy who doesn't even know the word for gun, has to decide whether he wants his hand shot or foot shot, yes. And yet, maybe thats what i like about the movie. It makes me cry. It moves my emotion. I could watch it a hundred times, and could get more and more hardened to certain scenes, but there will always be scenes that no matter how hardened i become, i will want to cry. I will want to go there and triggered by my temper, want to beat the crap out of the villain. It makes me empathetic, and cherish life all the more. It makes me appreciate what I have and makes me want to do so much more for those that dont have it. It makes me not want to waste my life sitting at the desk working on Numerical Analysis. All those books i listed do the same. They  give  me emotion. They give me wisdom, and my hope is, i can love all the more, as the end approaches.   Peace

      Here's a poem i wrote a few years ago. I have this habit of staying up really late and being productive, but then i am tired the next day and sleep in sometimes and the whole pattern starts over again. I wrote this one of those nights. It turned out pretty well. I really enjoy poetry. It's a good venting mechanism, especially when i am in my Engineering classes. I sometimes write my best while learning about fluid mechanics and statics and especially dynamics. Sometimes i laugh at myself from its irony. And then people ask me: "Why do you stay up so late?     Dark Hour by Jared Nelson   When the hour is late and the sound  Doesn't make its way through glass panes  Or through the trees of shady lanes  Or upon the shifting grains of sand  Look to the next day for your answer  Seek tomorrow to sooth your sorrow  For the night and its curses  Take hold like black hearses in flight to graves  Quiet and dead, silent and fed  By darkening demons demanding doom   Rooms can offer no light  To fight the plight you're in for  Against the sunless lands you're trapped in  Men hardly understand the battle  Of good and evil  When the boundless beams of beauty  Give up their duty for the day  And the devil makes his way  Upon this playground built for him   So pack up your books and bags  Take hold of the grace to be had  Of the soothing savior shunned   Bundle up in your beds and rest  God bless your soul that He tests  And save your might to fight in the morning  When mourning and sadness can be won  By the forgotten One and His words of wisdom sung   Go to sleep and sink deep  Into that land of disbelief  Dreams are the gauntlet you meet and pass through  Feet must rest and faces must falter  Before the dooming darkness alters its halter  On the horse of your life  You ride so swiftly toward the light  Some day you will shine so bright  And He will bind the night  To offereverlastinglife   And ever grasping light   So sleep peacefully each night  And let your meek soul thrive  While the coffins gobble weaklings  And the restless neighbor sins  And the endless ocean bends on end  And the tranquil trees fight the wind  While your lover's lips deeply breathe in  Awaiting a kiss  In the morning that's full of bliss

      Two in the morning is a good time for a fresh start, eh? The fact that its Tuesday morning makes it all the better. Add in that im listening to Mogwai. Not the most popular band, but one that is fitting my mood especially well.   Today i just bought my third movie of all time. Ipurchased  City of God  directed by Fernando Meirelles. A beautiful movie i must say. In fact i said to myself the day i watched it: "Self, you have to buy this movie when it comes out." Life is about fulfilling promises to one's self right? Ill leave that for others to answer.   I must say, its nice to fiddle around with technology after two solid weeks of doing Numerical Analysis homework problems. Numerical Analysis?...what is that? I found a definition of Numerical Analysis:  The method of approximation and interpolation of equations that dont have closed form mathematical solutions.  Pretty slick definition, eh? I like it. In fact i would tattoo it on my left cheek (the lower one) if it were not for the pain it would cause me. I already have enough pain from the class. I think if i had any more, i would develop some kind of post-traumatic syndrome, after thecourse of course. I have developed some rather fancy Excel spreadsheets that can compute Hermite Polynomials and use the Newton Interpolatory Divided-Difference Formula. Copies are available at a small charge :) You know, after spending hours and hours doing math, ive decided that math is one of God's favorite subjects. Consider for example the Fibonacci Sequence. It is described by     F 0  =1, F  1  =1,   and   F  n+2   = F  n   + F  n+1          Its terms occur naturally in many botanical species, especially those with petals or scales. For example, look at a pinecone and look at the patterns of the petals. They grow in a pattern described by this sequence, like such: 1,2,3,5,6,13,21,34,55,89, etc. Now that is something amazing. There is also a  Golden Ratio attributed to the Fibonacci Sequence. (Dont you just love the names that mathematicians come up with?) The golden ratio can be used to describe a spiral. Its rather hard to explain how and i dont want to further risk getting "some kind of post-traumatic syndrome." Maybe i will put a picture some time showing it. Or you can watch the movie  Pi . In it, the guy talks about this at one point. I really have grown to appreciate that movie since taking this class. And i think my final point is, for tonight, that God is in numbers some how. Maybe doing math is like reading the bible? Hebrew letters are also numbers you know.   Its now a considerable time later, and the tracks of Mogwai are running low. Peace.

        Due to my new found wisdom in posting pictures and such on the web, this one will be fun.   I found this Calvin and Hobbes comic that seems fitting for the blog...or should i say...Club Log?      urlLink    My friend Mark T. and i went camping last night. We went to Indian Caves State Park. Nice place i must say. Ive been going there since i was a child. We drove a ways and when we got there, found a good spot to park. Then we hiked a ways to our campsite. There, we started looking for wood. Looking for wood is one of those things that's in man's blood. A man gets to a campsite and its second nature. He throws down his stuff (and at night grabs a flashlight) and heads off into the forest. There is a sense of danger going in, yes. It's a forest. But that danger is hardly ever even acknowledged. And even if it were, the next thought would be: "That would be great if something like a bear or a mountain lion decided to attack me right now, I could take the tree limb im carrying and club it to death, and bring it back home to tell of the story...maybe i will even let it claw my left arm so ill have a good scar to go with the good story." I wonder if thats the reason men sit at home after a long day of work and watch tv...They have no forest to go into to gather wood for their fire. They have no fire to build.  And so Mark and i gathered wood for about an hour. We had little head lamps strapped to our heads and every once and a while we would call out to each others glow in the distance: "finding anything good?" And so into the forest we went, pushing down small trees, jumping and pulling off large limbs, and dragging and carrying it all back to the campsite, with sweat dripping and arms burning. After a while, when we had the equivalent of 14 small trees, we went about breaking it up. For those of you that have never broke up wood, it is an art. I have learned many techniques over the years from many people. One technique i am thankful of is one i learned from Matt S. and Todd L. This technique really brings out the best in a man. It requires first, setting the limb to be broken against a tree. Then a very large limb, or log is picked up and hoisted overhead. One takes many steps back with the log balanced high in the air. Then with a full force, one runs at the limb and throws the log with all their might against it. Usually the log will snap the limb to pieces. (Occasionally, this does not work as some will attest to when camping at Yankee Hill several years ago.) Mark and i, however did not have any large enough logs to throw with so we went about our work at first by bending the limbs until they broke. The problem with this was that a lot of the wood was wet and would not break. It would bend. And bend. For about another hour this was our toil. It was successful but slow and our faces often looked like this:     urlLink    But Mark, being a genius, then rediscovered and old technique for breaking wood. This technique requires a hefty tree with a fork in it near the base. It then requires the branch to be broken, to be placed in the cleft and then torqued. And torqued. Until it breaks. This worked wonderfully for us. And we broke the rest of our wood using this ancient technique. Then we got the fire going. The fire, was good. In fact, it was grand. We stood around it throwing more and more wood into it like the fire was our bellies and they were starved. Then we sat. I noticed and commented to Mark about how once the fire was going, it felt like home. We did not want to leave. The campsite miraculously changed from nothing to our home. And it was good to sit in the forest with this grand fire, feeling at home, while coyotes chattered in the background, deer peered from the depths and owls cooed.  It was a good fire, and Mark and I had good conversation. I am thankful for that. At one point Mark told me of the army, specifically the army Rangers. He said they called campfires, "Ranger TV." Makes sense. I will confess that Mark and I didnt look at each other much while we talked, we watched Ranger TV.  The night was good as well. It was a perfect night for sleeping out. The morning was swell too, and we made another fire, ate southwestern style eggs and drank coffee. I noticed a flyer laying on the ground nearby. It was printed on Indian Caves letter head. I tore off the letterhead. I wouldent mind having my own letterhead someday looks like it. Its brilliant, but until that day...    urlLink

        Im listening to Modest Mouse. Good for the midnight hour. Well, im done with my classes. Ive been done for three days now, and i decided to raise myself from the dead. Ive been dead you know. My classes ended well for those of you that wanted to know. Thankyou. I have been spending the day getting errands done, and doing things that i have wanted to do for a long time. One of those things was sharpening my skills on html code. Ive made some progress. As a result this website should be a little more exciting. One of the other things was doing tonight was looking over a list of websites i had written down a while back. One of the websites was  urlLink www.spacelaser.com  , which is a website for the Mueller Planetarium. The website lists the times and showing of laser light shows. Fantastic! From there i found a website for space news. And at that website was this little test to see if you knew which state had the most coastline. When i tried to answer i was directed to  urlLink this site , which claimed it was the home of the original online iq test. I took it. I got a 123. Somehow i found another site and took their test and got a 124. Then i found another site which i felt was really good because it talked about the results of my score for free. (the other sites wanted money. This one gave all kinds of fun facts for free.) The following is from that third website:        Your age adjusted IQ score is   126  and the average score for all test takers is 100.  You scored higher than 97 % of all the people that took this test        Grade    Range    Percent      Genius    144    0.13%      Gifted     130-144    2.14%      Above average     115-129    13.59%       Higher   than average      100-114    34.13%        Lower     than average       85-99    34.13%       Below average     70-84     13.59%      Bo rderli ne low    55-69     2.14%       Low    55    0.13%

      Greetings. Im listening to Low. How pleasant Low can be, especially at four in the morning when one finishes doing twelve hours of homework and is hyped up on caffeine and adrenaline. Because that is what i am. But Low is bringing back down. Down, down, down. Relaxation. Count to ten backwards. I have always thought that God is pleased with music. I often wonder if music, when played from the heart, out of humbleness, can be perfect. Perfect in the sight of God. Like its the one remaining perfect thing left after the fall. And God is pleased. He smiles and listens. Do you ever get shivers up your spine when your praying? Those goosebumps that come when youre humbled and focused on Him alone. Like youre touching God's face. Ever notice that music can do the same thing? Brilliant.  I am happy right now. Homework done, got Low, got nothin but love, got net. And imagine this...i dont have much to say. (Read what Mark A says in the previous post about that.) I would like to say that i was privileged enough to play my drum with Kate V and Case M the other night.  If either of you are reading this...thankyou much for letting me play.  I think i touched God's feet a few times then. I love playing with them. Kate is amazing. Case is too, but ive known that a long time. But the other night, when i was playing with Kate, it was like we were on an abandoned island, just playing. No hurry, no pride. Just music. There was nothing but the music flowing. It felt like i could have played forever, and i think God was pleased. It was all emotion. Our hearts were playing. Thats one thing about music that words lack at times. I cant always express myself with words, but with music, it works. One can dance with music, with words its hard to dance. One can close their eyes with music, you cant very well close your eyes when reading. And if you do, you use your ears. With music, there are only ears. I used to ask people the question: "If you had to choose to be blind or deaf, which would it be." Ive always said blind. Most everyone says deaf. Frankly, i dont know what their problem is. I guess they dont remember when Jesus says, "if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out" Never once did He mention jabbing out your ears. *Thought: A good t-shirt would be, "Only fools jab out their ears"* I would wear it.  I'm glancing at a picture i have posted on my wall. It appears that it was taken from a helicopter. Its a picture of two men, on top of a snow covered mountain. It looks to be about 20 degrees where they are, yet, they are mooning the sky. My good friend Nick Sh. Gave it to me. What a pal. Its funny, because when ever i see it amongst the hundreds of other pictures scattered about my walls, i am always sent deep into thought. My thoughts now? Its time for bed, i have a big day tomorrow...And im looking forward to brushing my teeth.  Blessings and Peace

      I like to write poetry. Some days, i read through what i wrote in the past and i hate it all. Other days, i like some of the things i wrote. I go through phases. Months will go by with nothing, then i might write twenty poems that are all similar. Then another few months go by. Ive written a decent amount this summer. I think its because i am taking classes and am not working. That combination will lead to creativeness. A lot of people complain that all i write is dark. This is simply not true. I have gone through phases where i write a lot of "happy poems." But i like the wisdom of my friend Mark A, who also has a history of writing some sad stuff. Not word for word he says: "If I am happy, i dont have anything to write about. You always have something to write when your down, sad, depressed, so on. Why do you think i havent been able to write anything since i got married." He was referring to his wife Linda, who, romantically, has made him happy enough that he can't write. Some would call that tragic. I don't know what to think. But the thought has occured to me that God is keeping me single so i can write as i do. (but i think alot of things that are rubbish.)  Anyways, due to the recent high number of complaints of my depressing poems, i have written a few happy ones that are dedicated to those people. Here they are, they are untitled:  Happy poem 1  Running marathons With music playing from the trees A forest fun affair They're playing my favortie song The one about the boy and the girl Somewhere in Canada They ran to Taking the Greyhound Always Sitting by each other I'm on the last leg Can't feel my legs But my heart is joyous I think i see my favorite person Waiting at the finish line Maybe we will keep running All the way to Canada   Happy poem 2  The forest is green this time But its spacious And the flowers smell wonderous In my bag i have the lunch And a letter i will give you later Maybe when we get to the ocean We can see it now From amongst the trees The trail is wide now And the air is cool   On the buisness side of things, i have recently read a book on how to pick locks. I have picked my front door deadbolt 5 times, (the best time being 3 minutes) the back door, and a few others. So i am offering my services. Call me anytime you are locked out of your house and i will get you in. I charge $5.00+. And no i won't tell you how i do it, otherwise i would be poor. :)  Peace

      I'm listening to Moby. God bless Moby. The other night i was out at a coffee shop. It will remain anonymous. I was leaving and walking back to my car.  As i approached, there was another couple that was getting into the car next to mine. It was one of those moments. I waited while they climbed in their minivan. The lady getting into the passenger seat finally noticed me as i awaited. She apologized. Isn't that interesting? Someone apologizing for getting in their car? I've been thinking about it. I can't seem to come to any conclusions. The thing is, if i had gotten there a split second before, she would have waited for me and i would have apologized. Why are people so apologetic and polite while getting in their cars, but once inside, they become animals, cutting each other off, flipping each other off, speeding, raging. So there i was, standing next to my car, unlocking it. They started their car up then, and the tailpipe sputtered wet, mucus-containing, exhaust onto my legs. I stood there helpless, feeling like my feet were cemented into concrete while someone was throwing up on them. The minivan had no idea. They drove off and i got into my truck, a little upset. And i became an animal, raging and speeding home.  The life of automobiles.  I am reminded of the time i went down to visit my friends Steve and Jen A. In Saint Louis. I was there for a few days before summer class started up. I was supposed to be back Monday for the start of a three week, pre-session class. I left Sunday morning, and not 20 miles from my departure, my truck broke down. After an interesting afternoon, and a day full of God's blessing, a thought-provoking ride with a tow-truck driver, i was back at Steve and Jen's house that night. I thought it would be polite to call my professor of my class, to let him know the situation and to seek his advice. After all, he is not only my professor, but also my advisor, and i have known him for a number of years. His name is Dr. Dvorak. For those of you that don't know him, i wish i could explain to you what he is like. But its very difficult. I will try. He always talks to everyone with a radio-voice. Full of ups and downs, very lively and clear, like his whole life he is broadcasting a commercial for a new type of housecleaner. He has a doctorate in Civil Engineering, but also has a degree in philosophy and psychology. Interesting combination, i must say. He is extremely well organized and has lists of things he wants to say, not only during class, but during short meetings with people, during which he might only have one simple thing to say. He is kind. So i called his office at 8pm on Sunday. He was there, mysteriously. He answered in a deep, mischievous voice, that made me think he was decoding some sort of algorithm for cold-fusion. I said that is was me, and i went on to explain the situation. Now, you have to understand that this class is only three weeks long. Class is 8 hours every day. And to miss one day would be like missing a week of class. So i asked him, partially out of respect and fake enthusiasm for the class, if i should get a bus ticket to get to town the next day for class. I asked what he wanted me to do. He responded seriously with a line that i will always remember, word for word, with a smirk: "Unfortunatly, we live in a society that revolves around the automobile. I would hate for you to leave your car there...I will leave that decision up to you." isn't that great? If only all our answers in life were straight of a dictionary/encyclopedia/etiquette book. If only our lives were lived out of an etiquette book.  So im supposed to be working on homework right now. I have been all afternoon, and i decided to take a break. But a little man in my head is telling me im supposed to be doing homework. You know what little man in my head: "Back off, i gotta take breaks, so i dont break, gimme a break" Ah, feel better already.  If you were an animal right now, what would you be? I think i would be a locust. I wouldn't mind being in some trees right now, in the wilderness, singing, swaying.  Here is a poem i wrote in April. I was probably in a bad mood, sitting by some people who thought they were pretty smart when i wrote it. Its titled:  I Bet You Thought This Song Was,  and it starts like this: "Hey" Enjoy. and Peace.  I Bet You Thought This Song Was  Hey colleagues We should get together to discuss issues of the world And ponder deep philosophical debates And relate Maybe we will sound smart And people will walk by and listen in And think highly of us Want to be one of us We can feel loved Like part of something important A community unmatched Detached Maybe we'll write a book That millions will read We'll go down in history And we'll smile and chuckle And bite our pencil tips While cocking our heads and looking deep in thought Like we are brilliant Then we will look out of the corner of our eyes To see if anyone's watching

      Last night i went fishing. We went to Olive Creek lake up by Princeton, NE. (I like using the term "up" rather than "down.") I went with my Grandparents and Cousins and Mom and Brother. Several of us stayed to camp. No one had caught anything all day. There were all kinds of people fishing, and not too many people caught anything. Around midnight, i was giving up, but i had some chicken liver still on my hook. So i threw out my line near the campfire and i rigged up a flashlight on top of the pole so that when i got a bite, the pole would bend, hence the light would dance. I was sitting with my mom by the campfire, and out of the corner of my eye, was watching the light. After about an hour or so, the light moved. I rose. Then the light went clear to the ground and i sprinted to the pole. Something was attached to the other end. I picked up the rod and jerked. I hooked em. Then i reeled. And reeled. Then the line got hooked on something. A little tree sticking out of the water about 15 feet from the shore. It was stuck. I went up and down the bank side trying to free the line. (Notice i use the phrase "up" first then "down") I couldent get it free. The fish kept jumping by the tree. I figured the line got tangled about two feet away from where the fish was. I was frustrated. I pulled harder, as it was the only thing to do, hoping the line would free. It broke. I reeled in the empty end and watched the fish jump by the tree where it was tethered to. I gave my Mom the pole and started to take off my shoes and pants. I was going to wade in and get that fish. My Mom scolded me. Its funny that i am 23 and have no fear of wading into a lake, but when my Mom told me not to go in, i argued with her, but finally gave in.  We went back to the fire and shortly after she went to bed. Then i went back to the shore line and stood contemplating. I could wade in without her knowing, but then i would disobeying. Besides, there was the risk of cutting my foot on glass or hooks or who knows what else. I only had one pair of shoes. I decided that i should not wade in. So i came up with an alternate plan. I tried taking some rope i had in my truck and lasoing the tree with rope. My thought was if i could pull the tree out of the lake, the line and fish would come with it.  I tried my luck with the rope. I worked at it for about an hour. I got pretty good at it. In fact a few times i got the rope loop around the tree, but when i pulled, the tree would bend and the rope would float effortlessly back to me. It was hopeless. I stood, extremely frustrated that the fish was still out there. At this point i did'nt want to the fish, i just wanted to free the fish. I was sad to think that the fish had to stay there tethered until by some miracle, God would release it, or by providence's powers, someone else would catch it. I finally went back to the fire around 2:30. I learned a lesson: Always bring a pair of sandals fishing.   On a more elementary note: I was at the mill tonight, and my friend Mark and i were discussing the possibility of my future wife being outside, on the dock. Mark finally took a proactive approach and went out to look. Note:  i do not know who my future wife will be. But he, on return, informed me that she was out there. He said she looked at him and seem to tell him through eye contact that she was thinking: "Where is jared?"...So he told me. We sat there for a while arguing the fact. My point was that the thought, "Where is Jared?" often gets confused with the thought, "Where is Mark?" His main counteracting point was: What if you leave tonight having known she was out there, but did nothing about it. So explained to him that A) If God wanted me to meet her, He would allow it without the telepathic mumbo jumbo Mark was into and B) tonight is a bad night to meet my future wife. I had a lot of homework and a test, and i wouldent want to meet her. At this point, another friend of ours, Derek, chimed in with "If i knew my future wife was out there, I wouldent be able to study and i would want to meet her." Well fine Derek, i said to myself. And to put a rest to the ridiculous conversation i went out with Mark. We stood there and i noticed several attractive people, and i wondered which one omniscient Mark would say was her. He looked disappointed and finally broke the bad news: "It appears she has left." And so we sat down in the very chairs my future wife and her friends sat in, and I have not been able to study since.
