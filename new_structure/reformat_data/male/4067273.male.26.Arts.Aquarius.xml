       It was many years ago when I first heard the term "Afro-Asian Blend." Since then I have tried everything in my power to make this term synonymous with me and only me. It fits me well, as far as I can tell, and I 'd like to make sure that no one else will try to use it. Hey, maybe someday I'll even try to copyright it....Who knows.   But like I said, it has been several years since I first heard this term, "Afro-Asian Blend." I was attending college in North Carolina and was majoring in Drama, which was quite strange to my family since I had always wanted to go into medicine. It was a very interesting time, one in which my mother(I'm sure) will never forget. But going on, it was the drama department which introduced me to a host of new and entertaining friends. These people and their ideas were completely new and fascinating to me. They shared A passion for life and art that I had not witnessed in others, and immediately I knew that I belonged with them. They invigorated me and motivated me to grow in my own art.   As time passed I began to meet more and more thespians in my dept., and came to regard all of them as my friends,a trend that would follow me throughoutmy theatrical experience. Soon I was hanging out with these funny artistic types and was invited to many a drama party. If you have ever been to a drama party, then you know of the jolly, crazy, fun that would erupt as well as all the...Well...Drama. Being Drama majors we couldn't help but bring about more drama no matter our environment.   It was at one these parties that I first heard the term. A fellow thespian came up to me and starting asking questions about me, such as why I was in the Drama dept. or even that particular school for that matter. She seemed really interested in me and I have to confess, I was in awe. She was an upper classman and was pursuing directing. I had already seen some of here work and was very impressed.   From the first moment she began talking to me, I could tell that there was something else she wanted to ask but she didn't knowhow she would do it without offending me. Now being someone of mixed heritage I knew that questioning lookon her eyes all too well. It said  "Where exactly are you from?"  In my years this question has come to me in many peculiar and maybe even rude ways, but I'm used to it and never let the question infuriate me. I've gotten  "What are You?"," Where are you from?","What are your origins?"  More directly I've gotten  "Are you Mexican?...Hawaiian?...Puerto Rican?...Indian?"  None of it surprises me anymore. But the question that girl posed on me that day will stay fresh in my memory forever.   Finally picking up her courage, she turned to me and said, " So what are you? Some sort of Afro-Asian Blend?"  At first all I could do was stare, not really registering what she had said. Slowly I worked what she said over in my head and could not stop the grin from spreading on my face or the laughter from erupting out of my mouth as I answered yes. Immediately I saw an image of myself walking into a coffee shop and asking the attendant "excuse me, but may I have the Afro-Asian blend?"  The Girl (whose name I can't remember for the life of me) was immediately embarrassed for having used such terminology, but I told her not to worry and thanked her profusely for introducing me to such a new and exotic flavor in gourmet coffee.
