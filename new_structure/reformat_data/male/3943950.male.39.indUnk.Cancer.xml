      No man is above the law. Verteran actor Robert Sorrells thinks he is.  A veteran character actor Robert Sorrells has been hit with a murder charge after witnesses told police he walked into a California bar and shot two patrons, killing one. The 74-year-old actor, who has appeared in such films as Death Of A Gunfighter and Gunfight In Abilene and popular TV western Gunsmoke, was arrested close to the Simi Valley bar - called The Regency Lounge - shortly after Saturday's shooting. He was booked for investigation of murder and attempted murder and held at the Ventura County Jail. Police Sergeant Paul Fitzgerald declined to say whether authorities knew of a motive, but said Sorrells had visited the bar before. A bartender says Sorrells had been at the bar until it closed on Friday night, returned Saturday morning looking for his credit card, then returned again in the afternoon and opened fire. Police say he shot Arthur De Long, 45, in the back and Edward Sanchez, 40, in the face and back - De Long was killed, while Sanchez, 40, was hospitalized in serious condition.   We pray for the speedy recovery of Mr. Sanchez and offer our condolences to the family of De Long.  The cosmic circle has struck again. How many shots did Sorrells fire?  Three.

      celebrity  n 1: a widely known person; "he was a baseball celebrity" [syn: famous peron] 2: the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed [syn: fame, renown] [ant: infamy]    dead(dd)adj. deadÂ·er, deadÂ·est   Having lost life; no longer alive.    Welcome, Reader, to the Celebrity Dead Pool.    I'll be your host, Ron Serling.    Have you noticed that when celebrities die, they always die in threes? The cosmic string that binds these three individuals were written long ago, before the stars burned in the heavens. There is no way to escape this fate that was built for them. When one celebrity dies, two more follow and the cosmic wheel keeps spinning.    This blog will track those deaths and celebrity related deaths. As you continue to read you will note that all of them have something to do with the number three.    Let us begin.      Isabel Sanford, the actress best known for her Emmy Award-winning portrayal of Louise "Weezie" Jefferson on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons, died of natural causes in Los Angeles; she was 86.    New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane died last Tuesday night in Los Angeles due to complications from leukemia, the pioneering '70s glam rock group's manager told our Celebrity Dead Pool. Kane was 55.    Two down. One to go.

      Julia Child, whose warbling, encouraging voice and able hands brought the intricacies of French cuisine to American home cooks through her television series and books, died in her sleep three days before what would have been her 92nd birthday.  "America has lost a true national treasure," Nicholas Latimer, director of publicity for Alfred A. Knopf publishing, said in a statement Friday. "She will be missed terribly."

      I must admit, even this reporter did not see this coming.   Funk singer Rick James, best known for the 1981 hit "Super Freak," died Friday, apparently of natural causes, police said. James, 56, died at 9:45 a.m. at a residence near Universal City, said Officer Esther Reyes, a Police Department spokeswoman.  "He died apparently of natural causes. We learned of his death after responding to a radio call," Reyes said.  And the third one is a very classic lady.  She will be remembered.  Actress Fay Wray, best known for her role in 1933 movie King Kong, died on Sunday. She was 96.She went on to be regularly cast as a heroine in silent movies, scoring her breakthrough in 1928's The Wedding March. In the early 1930s she made a number of horror movies, including Doctor X and The Vampire Bat, and became known as Hollywood's first "scream queen".  The cycle has been closed yet again.  Who will the next three be?  We will keep our eyes and ears open cause Death waits for no celebrity.

      The next batch of three has begun.  Eugene Roche, a paunchy character actor who played the kitchen-cleaning âAjax manâ in commercials and had memorable roles in such television shows as âAll in the Familyâ and âMagnum P.Iâ has died at age 75.  Who will the next two be?  Place your bets.
