       Wh en i was 16 i lost a dear lover in a herindous car crash that happened out side my fathers house. I was transformed in a loner and a careless searcher. My world had crumbled in my hands and i didn't even know it. My benevolent lover had been thrown out of the windshield of a 98 Ford Mustang Gt. You see i think that the lord leads us unto people by using people. I believe that my story is meant to be heard. It opens up new wounds every time i talk about it but it is beter heard and learned from then not.  Take my advise:       If you have something Special to you don't take advantage of you either else the lord will take it from you Period. Live and Learn.

      Live and Learn from my mistakes...    Every one finds what they think to be a true lover... Well, I thought that too. I believe that even the best of the Romantics have faults... I am what you could call a HOPELESS ROMANTIC. I can give all of this great advise, but i can't use it. I need to find out a way to tell a certain girl that i care for her but i dont know how to tell her i care for her. But i can give advise to people how they should do it. Strange huh?

          This is   the home of all things that are mysterious and strange; Painful and pleasurable. If you have a question leave me a way to return you an answer. I am a very intelligent person who will take every thing into consideration... Trust me with your thought because I trust you to tell me. I am a lonely walker of the night. I am Atlas the god who holds the world upon his back... Sometimes I can be Aries the god ready for war at a wink of an eye... Only you can set the mood... Trust my words because they have helped many... Remember I may walk the night but I can also ride the blazing sun. I was told that the world would love a man who could RENDER THE MOON... Well, You tell me should I try to render the moon or should I just continue my quest as Oz unto the little Dorothy?
