        just ended a wk of fun n siong orientation...    met new frens and fostered stronger relations with old frens... but din really get to know any freshies leh... how sad... mayb getting old liaoz... generation gap getting wider between the 81's n the 85's.    ithink most Sg gals can be materialistic or should i say more practical... theres this incident in camp where my fren got to pair up with a cute freshie forhis SP (Special Partner ) nite...    SP Nite is a program during our camp where the all freshies will be paired up to form couples and the guys will have to treat their gal partners to a romantic dinner out. being in a camp where the population of gals was twice tat of guys... the poor seniors (like me) would have to "top-up / sacrifice" their wonderful nite for this event so as to pair up the remaining gals (haha).    blind dates... tats watwe called it... kinda SDUstuff but heySDU pumped lots of $ for our camp leh... so ok lah... win-win situation mah :)    as i was saying... when my fren met up with his SP tat evening, the first question his female partner asked was  "Do u have a car?" Woa... tat was kinda shockingfor the"first impression"...my frenwhos a nice guyanddoesnt drive was rather sad when he heard tat... hmmm maybthere was a slight drizzletat evening when they met up... having a car to drive her for dinner was definitely a bonus... but hey dashing in the rain to the bus stop to catch 179 could be as romantic as well... hmmm errr mayb not in NTU bah... too many slopes in campus... hahaha    sometimesi just havetobelieve tat cars are the babe magnets... its not surprising to see gals crowd roundguys who drive... tink theres just too many examples out there tat show cars are great tools to woo gals...     no cars = no gals   i've stillgotprobto prove tat its wrong...
