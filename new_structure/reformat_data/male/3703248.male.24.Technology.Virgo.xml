      When I first started using the World Wide Web I started on Netscape v. 2.0.  It seemed fantastic at the time, but I was even more impressed when Netscape v. 3.0 was released.  Finally after I met my wife and used her old x486sx with Windows 95 I first laid eyes on Internet Explorer v. 3.0.  I have used Internet Explorer from v. 3.0 to v. 6.0 and now once again I believe it is time for change.  While Internet Explorer is a fast, free, and  a reliable web browser, it has one HUGE HUGE HUGE problemâ¦.. SECURITYâ¦.  For the past several hours I have been using Mozillaâs FireFox 0.9.1 and have visited sites that would have just demolished my computer if I viewed them with IE.  Also during this entire time I have not received a single popup.  Even with a popup blocker while using I.E, I still had a tremendously hard time completely avoiding popups.

      I must applaud Michael Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11.  I saw the movie on opening night in Tupelo Mississippi 6/25/2004 at the 7:35PM showing.  It was a powerful movie that dragged me through an entire range of emotions.  It would take through both laughter and extreme sadness.  For the first time ever I saw an audience applaud a movie.  It was a superior documentary and I believe everyone age 13 and up should see it.

      Today was a magnificent day.  For the past several weeks my wife has been on dialysis due to poor kidney function.  As of today her creatinine levels have returned to almost normal levels, she currently has 50% kidney function and does not need dialysis.  At this point I am ecstatic and I am hoping for a full recovery.   I feel bad for anyone who has to endure dialysis.  Imagine three times a week, having to go sit in a chair, unable to movie for five hours while every drop of blood in you is removed, filtered, and reinserted into your body.  That to meâ¦would suckâ¦â¦!

      Today I weigh 255.5 pounds.  Thatâs a far cry from what I started at (315 pounds) a little over a year ago.  My goal weight is 200 pounds; anything below that I believe will be too thin.  During the past year I have gone from a person who couldnât run 1/8th mile, to someone who could run at my highest 10 miles.  Currently I am able to run 2 miles, but my goal is 26.2 miles, so I have gone in reverse far as my training.  Losing weight is hard for me, but gaining it is easy.  I donât have a fast metabolism, but running helps make up for my cursed genetics.  My goal is to lose the 55.5 pounds extra by Christmas, but doing that will fairly be difficult.  Everyoneâs body is different.  It is this fact that no diet will work for everyone.  I enjoy carbohydrates too much to punish myself by eating the Atkins diet.  My method of dieting is to rapidly try things and adapt to what works.  Sometimes it is successful, sometimes it is not, but the body seems to change so what works now, may not work in two or three weeks.  Damn.

      People need to protect themselves.  I donât understand how in todayâs age people can have promiscuous sex and not use protection.  My wifeâs best friend now has herpes.  Why?  Because she met someone online, they met offline, and he shot his load inside her.  He infected her with herpes.  When she confronted him through AOL Instant Messenger he just laughed about it.  Meanwhile she was forced to go from someone who was having sex with thirty different guys to having sex with none.  Some people say it doesnât feel natural to wear a condom.  My response always is, âSo does the burning itch of herpes feel natural?â  Other people say, âIt canât happen to me.â My response is usually, âBullshit!â  I am not opposed to having hot steamy casual sex with everyone you can get your hands on, but by refusing to use protection you are saying you donât give a fuck about yourself or your partner.  The worst kind of person is one who takes the risk, contracts the disease, and then spends the rest of their life bitching about it.  My wifeâs friend does this constantly.  She wonât shut up about how sheâs infected and how her life is ruined.  Take your chances if you want, but just remember, having an STD is not sexy, it doesnât feel natural, and it can happen to you.  Care enough about yourselves to use protection.  If you do contract the disease due to your own stupidity, donât bitch about it.

      For the past month or so I have heard a lot of buzz around the new mail system that Google has come out with in beta called GMail.  I anxiously awaited my invitation to join and finally it arrived.  The thing I notice first and I assume everyone does is the 1000 MBs of storage capacity.  This and the clean look is what sets Google apart from the rest of Web Based email.  In my opinion the most important thing about GMail is not the 1000 MBs of storage, but the clean look to it.  Opening GMail, Yahoo, and Hotmail side by side, GMail is the only one not plagued with tons of banner ads.   In the near future GMail will start with the Google Adwords, but AdWords in general are much less annoying than banners, popups, and popunders.  They allow me to focus more on the content than the ads, but at the same time AdWords are more relevant than the normal banner ad which means sometimes even I click on them to read their content.  In summary GMail is the Ferrari of web mail services.  Itâs clean, fast, reliable, and good looking.  The only thing I see lacking is the inability to use POP3 email which is why GMail could never be my primary email service.

      I have never used a blog before.  I donât really read them often, but some people have some interesting ideas.  I really donât think I am a person with interesting ideas as much as they are unique.  I am starting this blog mainly to keep up with my day to day happenings as a memory tool kind of.  Just something so I donât forget my entire life.  I could care less if anyone ever reads this.  Truly my life is not all that entertaining so anybody who does read my blog will probably fall asleep.  Iâve often tried to keep Journals in the past.  They either get lost or destroyed.  Sometimes they would go months or yeas without being written in.  I am going to try to continue posting using the blog, but if I donât.  Iâm sure it will just be another thing that will be lost in time.

         I thought I, Robot is a decent movie, but not a great movie.    It has a shameless product placement ad for Converse All Star Sneakers.    In the movie the shoes were âVintage 2004â.    If Will Smith had focused more on the task at hand and less on the damn footwear it would have been a much better movie.      </post></Blog>
