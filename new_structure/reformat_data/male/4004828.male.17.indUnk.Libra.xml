       Moving from Dublin, Ireland to Bulgaria is a drag so what pick me up is better than starting a new journal? Well, I can think of a few like drugs, sex, and rock and roll, but this'll have to do for now. Dad moved us all here because being the President of O'Grady Pharmaceudicals Inc. he has to supervise and take part in all the research. They're testing a new drug which could be a breakthrough in the field and requires some rare fungus. The only probably is that the damn thing is only found in Bulgaria. Oh well, might as well make the best of it. At least we've moved into a bigger house. Things should go nicely moving here except a few minor details...  The first few days of school have been eventful to say the least. Promptly upon walking into the Entrance Hall I have girls falling at my feet. What can I say? I know I should be used to it, but one does love to be flattered. Okay enough of the ego booster, but seriously, in no more than five steps into the hall, I had two girls fall to my feet...literally! One busted her head open and the other spilled her belongings all over the ground. Being the gentleman that I am I of course, helped them get their stuff back together and made their aquentance. Both are very nice and attractive girls, except I think I fancy Ginny better.  Then I met the only male on the face of the Earth to PMS. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, a priick with mood swings wider than the Pacific Ocean. He made a very odd impression on me and it seemed that as soon as he came everything went from odd, to odder. First he went around coldly looking down upon me and then he completely lost his head and kept sneering at me. Later he went further to be apologetic, and finally he adopted a nervous attitude and asked Ginny out...right in front of me! I certainly hope his parents aren't paying too much for his psychologist because IT ISN'T WORKING! I wonder how many bi-polar people there are at this school.  Speaking of bi...I met a set of twins. Neither of them bi-polar, just 100% bitch. Pureblood elite, and as you can imagine, neither of them fancied me very much. My first encounter with them happened while I was exploring the dungeons. I was hoping to find something of interest, but only managed to get myself lost. Of course the twins should come to grace me though. Did I mention that they're hot though? Well, they are, along with every other girl in the school... ::droolz:: I think I'm gonna like it here! ;)  But anyways, back to my story, later I found them in the forest plotting some sadistic scheme of theirs and when I harassed them a bit, the elder one thought it would be fun to punch me, kick me, and then curse me. With a bloody nose and boils popping up all over me there wasn't much I could do. Besides, I would NEVER hit a girl no matter what she did to me. Limping back to the castle I tended to my bloody nose. At least it's not broken and it's not swelling.  That's all so far from the crazy life of Brenton O'Grady, so until quill meets parchment again, I'll be out finding more haters and getting into more trouble. See ya.
