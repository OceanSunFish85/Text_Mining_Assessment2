      Dear Beloved,   Forgive me for resorting to putting my words down in black-and-white, but it is really the only way that I can find to push myself into saying to you the things I need to say.  As much as Iâd like to  be eloquent and expressive and handle this perfectly, this is just coming from deep down inside of me.  From a place that has been unbelievably hard for me to get in touch with lately.  Loving you is a fulfillment of a lifetime of hopes, dreams, aspirations, goals, etc.  There are so many cherished moments that we have shared over the years that sometimes it overwhelms me to think of how much we have been blessed.  But we both know that along the way somewhere Iâve become lost.  Emotionally Iâve become more and more unable connect to the experiences of my life.  Spiritually Iâve become distant and disconnected.  Physically Iâve become anxious and susceptible to illness.  The intimacy of our relationship has suffered as has my ability to express love to you and the boys.  Years of built-up pain and fear compounded by the processes Iâve developed to cope with specific emotions make it nearly impossible for me to experience emotion at all â or remember if I ever did â or feel like I ever will again.  Over a long period of time and specifically at critical moments in time Iâve lost hope.  Lost it to the point that life has often felt almost unbearable and the contemplation of death has hovered terrifyingly close to me.  The continuum of these emotions â joy and despair - have led me to this place where it has become obvious that to regain the ability to experience joy I must allow myself to experience the pain that brings despair.  Iâd do almost anything to avoid this process.  My days are a mixture of attempts to bargain and plan and struggle to find a way to heal, to keep moving forward, without facing the things that brought me here.  The result is that Iâm not able to be the man that Iâve strived to be all my life.  Not the man that you imagine me to be.  Iâve struggled for years to be that man, but in the end Iâm just a shell of the man I want to be and completely out of touch with the man I truly am.  Iâve somehow managed this charade through a great deal of denial, manipulation, deception, and living a set of somewhat parallel existences.  One is the man you see.  One is the man that lives deep inside of me; the one Iâve never wanted to be, but the one I face in the mirror every morning.  At this point Iâve not really come to grips with how Iâve gotten here â but the reality is Iâm here and you are here with me.  But it is crystal clear to me that Iâve got to deal with these issues to be whole, and I need your help.  Iâve now reached the point that Iâm able to admit that his can not be done alone, in darkness, but must openly exposed to the light.  From the time I was a small child Iâve been a complicated bundle of contradictions.  It has always been so important to me, even as young as seven, that I do the right thing and be responsible.  But at the same time there has been this deep, powerful, painful internal conflict between what Iâve wanted to do and how I feel about my sexuality.  Every single day is a struggle with the guilt and shame of my physical attraction to men.  Iâm desperately sorry for the pain this revelation causes you, but I can no longer live with the denial that this is something that isnât going away and that impacts every other aspect of my life.  My primary desire to work through this with you and restore myself to the person Iâm meant to be.  The last thing I want to do is to injure you or the boys or to destroy what weâve worked so hard to achieve.  If I could avoid this event in my life, or delay it, or fix it, I would do anything to make that happen.  The only thing Iâve realized is that Iâve not found a workable alternative that moves me toward the ultimate goal â to be the man you and the boys need me to be.  Sincerely, Your Husband
