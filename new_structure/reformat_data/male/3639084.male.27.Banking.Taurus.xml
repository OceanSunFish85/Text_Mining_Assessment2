       i have resigned from my current company. a bit "dont know how" feeling.  anyway, quote a passage from my frd. i think he also copy from elsewhere. it should reflect my reason of resignation.   I would rather be ashes than dust!  I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze  than it should be stifled by dry-rot.  I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom  of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.  The function of man is to live, not to exist.  I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.  I shall use my time.
