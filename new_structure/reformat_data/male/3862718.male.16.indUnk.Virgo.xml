            Television is a part of my daily life. Without the constant chatter from the television set, I think life would be too quiet. In the present society, most families have at least a television set. Therefore it is impossible to miss out the advertisements.         There are many types of advertisements and the most prominent is of course from that of television. An advertisement can be considered to be a paid announcement specifically designed to attract public attention or patronage.       With such easy access to advertisements, I believe that there is a need of some form of restriction. This is because there are some advertisements that carry undesirable content, such as violence,that might influence people, especially children. There is a need to shield children fromthese advertisements asthey are susceptible to their influence. In Singapore, there is the Media Development Authority (MDA) to deal with such cases. Either these advertisements are censored or they are played at a later time slot so that children are less likely to view it.       Furthermore, there has been cases of advertisement fraud. Some people are wooed by the idea of high paying jobs without realising the trap they fell into. In the end, they are not only jobless, they lost a large sum of their money. Such is due to advertisements and its catchy terms, fooling the innocents. Therefore, there is a need to ban such advertisement to prevent innocents from getting cheated.       However, advertisements are not all bad and schemeful. There are some creative advertisements that are educational. For instance, advertisements telling people to drink more milk so as to reduce the chance of getting osteoporosis. Such advertisements promotes healthy living and should be encouraged.       On a last note, advertisements canbe good and bad. It depends on you reading in between the lines.

       I would say that the one belief I hold on to in life is the famous Nike phrase, "Just do it". This is simply because no matter what we do, we should not think too much into the matter. Instead, we should just go ahead and do it. If we ponder too much about the matter, we will start weighing the pros and cons. This is time consuming and in the end, we may not be doing what our heart really wants to accomplish. Even if we do it after much consideration, the joy of it is already gone.Furthermore, I believe that if we were to be too careful about things, we will never learn any mistakes. If such mistakes do happen in the future, it might be too late to correct them. Lastly, this will test our flexibility and acceptance ofnew things andalso how we handle them.Therefore, if there is any opportunities, we should "just do it".
