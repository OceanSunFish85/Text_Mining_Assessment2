      A good friend of mine has had a visitor for the past two weeks. Joy (the visitor) is a professional in the mental health community. Joy is also a 60 y/o lesbian. Finally, Joy is a dedicated hater of G.W. Bush. Now, I must admit that in my mind the sum of the former pretty much equal the latter. Stereotypical thinking on my part? I suppose it is. I'll happily go on record as saying that stereotyping people is pretty stupid, but as my old man used to say (before he left this shitty world) if its stupid but it works, it ain't stupid. When prodded into a political discussion, Joy armed herself with all of the weapons that I've come to expect.  "Bush lied about WMD"  Last word that I got, enough sarin and mustard gas to kill approximately 200,000 people has been found in Iraq. If that ain't "Mass Destruction" well I just don't know what is. Saddam killed untold thousands with such weapons already. Pres. Clinton (why do liberals admire this fellow so damned much, anyway?) admitted that Iraq possessed such weapons in 1997. The "Yellow Cake" conspiracy? Well, if Saddam was not pursuing nuclear weapons, he must have been more of an idiot than a strongman. Read up on the Niger connection, and pay attention to the details behind Joseph C. Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame. Use some uncommon sense.  "It's just another war for oil"  How many of Iraq's oil fields have we confiscated? The turn over to indigenous rule proceeded sooner than expected and we don't have rights to a single Iraqi oil field.  Let us lump the next two together.  "Innocent Iraqi Civilians are being murdered"/"American soldiers are dying".  People die in war. It's unfortunate, but it is true. How many people would Saddam have murdered by now, if left to his own diabolical devices?  "But war never solves anything."  Nothing except slavery, the Nazis, oppression, genocide, and many other things evil enough to stir the hearts of men who believe in justice and liberty.  It was the same argument I've had hundreds of times before. Nothing new, nothing radical, nothing what so ever based upon experience, logic or even obvious truth.   This isn't really about the war, it's about stereotypes. There is a reason why humans get stereotyped, and apply stereotypes in such large number. Probably many reasons. Why did I assume that someone of Joy's bonifides would cleave to these tired old arguments? Why did I succumb to stereotypes? Because they often, perhaps usually hold true.  "I am a woman, so I am anti-war"  "I am a lesbian, so I hate Bush" (ooo there's a pun there somewhere!)  "I have enjoyed higher education, so I am liberal"  Is it wrong to hate Bush, or be liberal or anti-war? Obviously not. Differing opinions lend to social Darwinism and make us stronger as a people. Is it wrong to be a woman, a lesbian, or educated? Just as obviously not. It IS wrong to automatically be one just because you are the other. We'll never stop stereotyping people, because the technique is handy and often effective. We CAN however make stereotypes weaker. We, all of us, can stand out as individuals and shed the chains of our stereotypes. Thinking for one's self takes a little work, and a LOT of uncommon sense.
