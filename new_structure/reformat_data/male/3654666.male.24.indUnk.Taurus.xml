       Everyday is the same.  I wake up assuming that I'm going to have a good day.  It never fails though, by 10AM, my stomach is in knots, my heart rate is throttling about 30% above average and I'm lighting another cigarette.  I've thought about this for a long time and I really don't think I'm over-reacting or delusional.  I seriously think that, at minimum, five people out there exist for the sole-purpose of pissing me off.  What a conspiracy theory that is.  The other question at hand, are the motives of these people deliberate or sub-conscious?  Either way, I'm starting to wear very thin.  I need to find some way to channel all of this negative energy into something good. Is that possible?  I really don't know.  What I do know is the countless nights I go home and just want to be left alone.  Now, this wouldn't be such a problem if I were the only one affected, but there are other people in my life that suffer from my inability to be content.  Oh, by the way, all of you self-help gurus out there, who have suggested breathing exercises to me, screw off and get a life.  Those remedies only work for the poor f*ckers who can't breath and hyperventilate when they get upset.  Yes, I'm thankful that I'm not prone to wheezing.  However, I don't want to live my whole life this way.  Will I ever be completely content?  Am I really asking for too much?  I don't think so.

       Am I the only person who feels like I'm surrounded by nothing but stupid people?  Have you ever stopped and counted the number of stupid people and then the number of intelligent people you know?  It's completely insane!  Now, I know that I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm constantly being tortured by the misdeeds of the special people, as I like to call them.  They're everywhere you turn.  It does not matter where you are, your bound to be subjected to their unintelligible ways.   And it just so happens; the greatest concentration of these people is your place of employment.  Now, I'm not asking for everyone to have an IQ of 145, but can Wal-Mart or Target please start selling common sense.  I don't know, I always thought that intelligence and common sense came hand in hand.  Maybe I'm wrong, but is it really too much to ask for everyone to at least have one of these traits?  I'm tired of cleaning up after the mistakes and misadventures of these cracker jacks.  What ever happen to the thought of working hard and doing your best?  Of course, maybe they are doing their best.  If that's the case, I pity the children of these buffoons.  Another thing, have you ever noticed that the moron or dumb ass that you went to high school with has not changed?  Is there not a rule somewhere, describing survival of the fittest?  If there were such a thing, wouldn't you think that all of these half-wits would be squashed out?  Or maybe we're spending all of our time and energy catering to these people.  What a concept that is.

       What a divine pleasure it is to be escorted by a child through the grocery store, well any store for that matter.  Those of you without children have no idea the pain and frustration we go through just to pickup a few items to prepare dinner.  In fact, I envy those of you who are completely oblivious.  Before I had children, I was also unaware that any such phenomenon existed.  For those of you unaware, I have provided before you an enlightening experience.  The excitement begins right after you proceed through the doors.  Instantly, you have two bogies streaking off into different directions.  You catch back up with them and have this crazy idea that you will be able to go about your business.  This is not the case.  You get the two year old into the cart, no problem. However the four year old is a completely different story.  The imagination and level of excuses that he bestows upon you are unprecedented.  He either wants to ride on the end of the cart or walk, promising to behave and not to unleash his wrath upon you.  You have heard this before and make an attempt to levitate him into the cart, big mistake.  You have now awoken what I like to call Satan's minions, because nothing else could create such a horrific sound.  Oh, by the way, this is the part where everyone in the store has now paused to see who is beating there child.  Be smart, give in, and let him walk and be on your way.  First stop, the produce department, you couldn't forget bananas for those little monkeys, could you?  Your thinking now this isn't so bad, right?  Just what you thought, the infamous cereal isle is right around the corner.  This is the second worst area in the store, we'll get to the first later.  A kids dream, more chocolate, marshmallows, and sprinkles than you can shake a stick at.  Did I mention that all of those items are placed on the bottom shelf?  Geez, I wonder why.  Now your being bombarded by two high pitched screaming voices who feel that their world is going to end if you don't get fruity pebbles, cocoa puffs, and crunch berries.  Being the diplomatic guy you are, you attempt a compromise by allowing one box of the sugar filled toxins.  This idea does not go over well.  What do you know?  You now have one child imitating a screaming fire truck and one trying to show MJ a few new dance moves while spinning on the floor.  Once again, you are looked upon as the evil parent abusing his kids.  At this point you throw all three boxes in the cart along with the squirrel, which has been rolling around on the floor and make a mad dash to the check out.  Just when you thought this nightmare was almost over, you've arrived at what you perceive as the light at the end of the tunnel, afraid not.  Not only are you subjected to evil marketing schemes throughout the store your are now faced with and endless array or candy bars, suckers, gum, you name it.  It not over yet.  You now have to children hurling themselves fearlessly over the sides of the cart to get their hands on anything possible.  You try as you might to contain the little monsters while giving the cashier the look.  To those of you who are not parents let me describe the look. Imagine a face filled with helplessness, anger, and anxiety all rolled into one.  You struggle to reach your wallet without releasing your new found prisoners, and hand over the cash.  You are now on your way out the door with two wiggle worms in hand, 3 boxes of cereal, and a bunch of bananas.  In to the car they go, when you know realize that you'll be making an emergency stop at McDonald's, because you somehow managed to leave the store without dinner.

       Does anyone really know where they are going?  I'd really like to think that someone does.  However, I go through this state quite frequently where I feel lost and destined for a higher purpose.  Right now, there are only a few things that I'm sure of.  I know that I am a father of two beautiful boys that have been an exhilarating force keeping me headed in the right direction.  I don't know where I would be without them.  But once again, I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life.  I have been separated from my wife for a year now and the divorce has been initiated.  This last year has been such a weird experience for me.  Iâve always had this perception that I was a completely independent person and now Iâm not so sure.  I really have to say that up until about two months ago I was unable to embrace this new life of freedom.  I was unable to escape this endless feeling of loneliness and boredom.  Iâm finally to a point where I feel like my true self again.  Itâs funny how one person can mold you into something you donât even know you are.  Actually its scary, the whole thought of our lives and existence being so strongly influenced by people who come and go.  Itâs not really a new concept.  I just never thought about it.  So here I am now, feeling free, focused, and more powerful than ever, but what now?

       If I could pick one movie to portray my workplace it would be Office Space. If you havenât watched it, I suggest you drop everything and go rent it. Iâve worked in a lot of different environments, but Iâve never experienced so much bureaucracy and confusion in one place. Most chaos can be attributed to our ownerâs habitual nature of changing job duties and authority on an almost weekly basis. At this point in time I am the poor fool in charge. This will last until someone else has some bight idea on making the company profitable or until our fearless leader gets pissed off at me again. Either way, Iâll accept this mission and be happy that Iâm not currently on his shit list.  Our office is made up of a variety of annoying personalities, one of which, a man I like to Mr. Limp Dick. He possesses the most annoying personality of all. He wanders around the office aimlessly, putting his nose into everyoneâs business, and tries to convince us all that he is the office manager. In reality, he is nothing more than a brown noser and tattletale. He possesses absolutely no leadership skills what so ever and is unable to handle any forms of pressure being bestowed upon him. Iâm not complaining about his inability to lead, because this company would be the next titanic if he were in charge. It just kills me that people like himself, one of the special people, have brainwashed themselves into thinking that they know shit, when they donât know jack. Iâm thinking that the majority of his malformed personality stems from the fact that he inhabited his parentâs house until the age of 40.  I also have the pleasure of working with Amnesia Man, another delusional personality, who makes my day almost unbearable sometimes. He was sane at one time, yet here we have another man whose mind was fucked up by a woman or should I say by her rejection of him and his mommaâs boy tendencies. I would really feel sorry for this pathetic soul if he didnât piss me off all the time. I have never known anyone who could fuck everything up beyond recognition in the half-hour between him and I coming into work. I depart in the evening and everything is chronic bliss and I arrive in the morning to nuclear meltdown and upon questioning his actions, he remembers nothing of his foolhardy demise. I just really hate it when I am trying to take a proactive approach and trying to make things flow more efficiently, and I have to step back and react to an unneeded disaster and waste of time. It wouldnât bother or surprise me so much if he wasnât at one time a great guy to work with, but heâs inevitably lost his mind. Picture a grown man, in just a diaper, curled up on the floor, sucking his thumb and you would understand my frustrations.  Six months ago, I would have complained about working with women. However, we are now only graced by one female presence. You can all say what you want, but when you have two or more women working together in a small office, there is bound to be trouble. Donât get me wrong, when they were friends all was well, but women are always conspiring against each other. I would get one day of peace and then act as a mediator the next. I finally got fed up with these frequent occurrences and let the claws fly. Needless to say we no longer have the afternoon catfights.  Anyway, though this place drives me crazy on a daily basis and Iâm constantly scanning the web for new employment, I do realize that no workplace exhibits an aura of perfect harmony. I have accepted this hell for the time being only, because of the experience and knowledge that I might gain and who knows one day I might be the all-knowing one.

       I canât wait to pick up my boys tonight. Itâs only been three days but I feel empty when there not around. I canât wait to see Chrisâs constant smile and Mikeâs scheming face. Iâll arrive at their momâs apartment. Mike will run out the door with cars and trucks in hand yelling some line from Fast &amp;amp; the Furious. Chris does something extremely different yet interesting. Heâll run towards me doing a combination of running, jumping, and skipping. I really donât know what you would call that, but I know heâs happy to see me. Their mother weâll be trying to make small talk, but Iâm completely oblivious to anything she has to say. Iâll walk them down the hall and out the door to my old Chevy beater. Theyâll fight over who get to sit next to Dad in the truck, but before long weâre on our way.  Itâs crazy how much excitement they get from my driving. We wonât even round the first corner and mikeâs screaming for me to squeal the tires. Drive faster and rev the motor up are among other requests that I receive. The funniest part however, is the fact that they think that old truck is the fastest vehicle around, believe me its not. Iâd be lying if I said that I didnât enjoy it. It kind of makes me feel like God, toying with their reactions.  Iâm not sure what weâll do tonight. Iâm excited to see them, but tired as hell. I really hate having them one day at a time. I always want them to have the best time ever when there with me. I guess I sort of feel like if they donât leave happy that unpleasurable thoughts swirl in their minds about me. It wouldnât be so bad, but when I pick them up on a weeknight and theyâre tired, cranky, or just plain evil, itâs hard to have a good night and then theyâre gone in the morning. Iâm trying to get something arranged with the EX as far as having them for a few consecutive days during the week, but obviously have seen no success thus far.  I know that I shouldnât worry so much about it, but Iâve always wanted to be the best dad possible. I want them to know that Iâm in their corner and that Iâll always be here. The divorce has really got to be confusing for them. I donât want them to feel like I did and think their dad didnât love them. It was a real eye-opener to me when Mike was born. At that point, I realized just how much of a piece of shit that my father was to me. I never will understand men that donât take and donât want any part in their childâs life. Those kids are a piece of you that will be here long after your gone.

       First of all, sorry to those of you who have read this blog on a regular basis and have seen absolutely no activity, but I have been busy as hell for the last month. God that was a long sentence! I just moved back in with my parents. Out of all of the things, Iâve had to do this year; it was definitely the hardest. I felt like a looser at first, knowing that I havenât had to run back to mom and dad, since I moved out, 6 years ago. I just couldnât make it anymore, financially speaking. Itâs funny how you go through life, honestly believing that you can make it through any obstacle, untouched and unscaved. It just isnât so. Through the course of the last year, I have lost my house, car, financial stability, and pride. I fought for every one of those things and inevitably lost. What can I say? I have been struck by the joys of divorce, among other things. Oh well, such is life. I havenât given up though and I donât plan on it. So, to all you motherfuckers out there who are trying to break me, itâs not going to happen. Iâve come to the understanding that anything that holds me back or wears me down only makes me stronger. Iâve also acquired a new outlook on life. Itâs time to focus on the important things. Iâm going to slow down, absorb as much as I can, and try to live everyday as if itâs my last. My first two priorities in life are Chris and Mike; everything else is just detail. All I can hope for is to influence their lives like my dad influenced mine. Its kind of funny, how I realize now, how much my parents are responsible for who I am today and what I have accomplished. I wouldnât be anything without them, thanks! Thereâs also another moving force in my life thatâs helped me keep my head above water, she knows who she is, thanks to you also. Its hard to say how the last few months would have fell into place without your reassurance and support. Another piece of enlightenment that I have acquired, is the fact that life means nothing without your friends and family. So here I am ready for anything, refreshed, and never more confident.
