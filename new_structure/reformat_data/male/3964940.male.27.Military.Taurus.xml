      Well another eventful Friday... I guess. Actually did something worth some time and effort. Delivered some furniture to Becky and rolled in some dough at the same time.   It was a long day at work but I had fun tonight. Ran around town with the dubbers and went to Buffalo Wild Wings for some drinks. Of course I didnt drink because I refuse to drive even after one. So I just drank my sweet tea . The exciting life of Preston. Well that's it for now. Going to a welcome home fromAfgan party tomorrow. Probably have a few drinks and have a good day. Talk to you all in the future.

      I don't seem to have any pictures of my mom.  Guess I've just always been used to her taking pictures of me since that's how I grew up; was in front of the camera.  Sorry Mom.  I suck.

      Saturday had to go into work.  Blah I hate work.  Anyways.  Just a few more days and I'm back at home for a few weeks.  Dreading the drive but it always seems to pay off in the end.  I'll probably be leaving early in the morning around midnight.  Ok that's really early.  Hopefully that will  put me home around noon and I'll hit my mom's Ice cream shop first.  Good ice cream after a long trip should do me justice. Anyways.  Life around here is just full of drama so I'm glad to be getting out of here for a while.  My new room mate will be moving in some of his stuff today.  That'll be cool he can help look after the animals.  I have to take some stuff to Becky so she can watch the cat while I'm gone.  I'll be taking the camera with me and will post what I can from my dads lightning fast connection (dial-up).  If I have problems posting I'll just update this way for now until I get back.   urlLink
