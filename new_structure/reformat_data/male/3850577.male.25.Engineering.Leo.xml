      Tonight I yearn the healing waters...  Sleeping at night is becoming difficult...for some reason the night wakes me.  I don't sleep as much as I use too...I tend to forget that sometimes...problems stay with me...until I find solutions...I hate headaches...  Solutions...why is it that I always seek some solution.  I don't admire those who go and just run without solving anything, but sometimes I wonder how can they live...without find some resolution.  Sometimes I think they wonder how can I live...trying to solve everything.  One of my favorite quotes in a good movie of mine is "When I thought I was out...they pull me right back in".  I feel that way right now.  During the night when I sleep...I start to see demons.  But the demons I see...try to be my friend...some even think they know me.  For years I have tried endlessly to slay the demons...but they only want more of me...they want me...in pieces...    Tonight I will invite the demons...I want to see who wears the masks.  I am looking forward to L.A. this weekend...for some reason...I find L.A. to be the place where once...I found myself.

      June 25, 2004  My work so far is intense.  Yet I accept the challenge.  Challengesâ¦itâs what life is about.  I have many challenges here in CA.  I donât understand how people fail?   When people fail or give up, or get scared, what goes through their mind?  What substance of failure do they feel?  Failure is not a medium.  Itâs not a physical thing.  Itâs only one manâs opinion.  I have learned how frail men can beâ¦.  June 28, 2004  I went to the city this past weekend.  One thing is for certainâ¦I am disgusted.  Someone in my past told me once, that San Francisco will make me softer.  I beg the differ.  It only makes me harder.  I walked the street and I see people who are caught up in a grid.  The SF peninsula is beautiful, yetâ¦I find that it is infested.  This entire area is infested with rats, its only a âvessel of seagoing ratsâ.  People here thrive by a daily machine they cannot turn off.  These people are said to be âsuccessfulâ full of âlifeâ and âexperienceâ.  Yet these people know nothing of civilization, survival, independence.  I wonder sometimes how San Francisco is perceived as a âMeccaâ?  Itâs really an urban sprawl full of lifelessness.  Partying, buying stuff, seeing who is out, drinkingâ¦this is not lifeâ¦  June 29, 2004  I think of home, I close my eyes and I see my grandfatherâs mountain, the desert, the woods.  I am thankful of where I come from, where I will return soon to come.  Blood is thicker than anything elseâ¦it is a fundamental I hold true.  I feel the bond in my family growing stronger.  I am very pleased with myself; I did not extend my blood to anyone elseâ¦.I never will.  Why pollute my motherâs blood with anyone elses.  I was once told by a wise bro of mine âMen are like buses, when one goes, another comes alongââ¦it is trueâ¦but I do not want another bus ride.        July 2, 2004  Have you ever watched a moon rise over the Napa valley?  I could not sleep this nightâ¦.instead I cried.  The tradeoff with selfishnessâ¦is that you will be alone.  Tonight I only smoke and watch the moon rise.  I think of my recent past, what I said, what I did, what I wantedâ¦what I left behind.  For the first timeâ¦I cried.  I wonder I cried?  Do I truly miss something besides my family, my homeland?  I guess when time comes for an end, it comes to you like fire.  So âlet it burnâ.  I truly believe that the element that thrives the most in my heart is fire.  I admire the energy of fire the mostâ¦its really the most feared.  The most powerful elements in this universeâ¦.lightning, stars, the sunâ¦.are all fire.  I hope the sun sees me from time to time...and embraces me.  One thing that someone doesnât know is that:    The stars that tell him âwhenââ¦.are mine in the first place.       July 4, 2004  Here I am sitting in my apartment.  Have you ever seen a sunrise over the SF bay?  For the past 2.5 weeks I walked this area seeing what I could find to intrigue meâ¦.so farâ¦I have found nothing.  Nothingâ¦..I donât fear it, yet I do fear the consequences of letting nothing enter your life and making your heart empty.  One lesson I have learned, but will probably never embrace, is that selfishness will leave you lonely.  Selfishnessâ¦itâs not a bad thing.  How else will the world progress without the few great selfish men?  Even my own people understand thatâ¦why is it that even fewer people make a great deal out of that concept.  Is it because they are incapable?  Two weeks have passes since I drove into the sunset from Ft. Defiance, Arizona.  Itâs ironic that darkness fell that night for myself and anotherâ¦. emotions and hearts went dark.  I crossed the desert full of darkness and nothingâ¦and came across a beingâ¦.I saw its silhouette in the night.  It was the western mountain.  Once again I made another promise:  to gain strength in CA.  This promise is for me though.  No one will live my life except for me.  I thought about the last promise I made to another mountain:  the Northern mountain.  But that nightâ¦.it told me âNoâ and now I wonder Why did that mountain say that?      I made my journey to the great western oceanâ¦.maybe today I will visit my mother?   I did indeed visit mother in the ocean...and I saw her signs...being alone is always good...finding yourself over and over is always for the great.  The fireworks by the Golden Gate was enchanting...seeing the glows in "Stans" eyes...was like seeing the sunrise at night...
