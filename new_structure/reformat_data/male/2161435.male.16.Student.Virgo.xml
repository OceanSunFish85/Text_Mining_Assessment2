      ...find what you all desire/need, and only then can you go home and avoid looking eachother in the eye afterwards.' The group stared at eachother, all felt that they were happy so what could they possibly need? 'How about looking in the mirror from Harry Potter that showed your hearts desire?' suggested Vicky 'And where is this mirror?' inquired Rob 'We'd have to ask Dumbledore' 'But...' and so on and so forth Rob destroyed Vicky's logic till the Davemother who knew Vicky to be right, stopped Rob by giving him blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a cute little dog to complete the sissy look. Rob hid behind a tree. 'Now listen,' the davemother said, 'i will give you a clue for what Rob needs...or I shall just tell you cause he really needs MODESTY!' 'Do not, Im perfect!' Rob proclaimed The others looked at eachother and agreed first get the modesty before midnight (well you know that someone would kill Rob if he didnt have some by then) and then after to search for this mirror and seek what each desired. The fairy davemother was to come along to, to finally rid her/himself of this cross dressing curse bestowed by someone with a poor sense of humour. And off they went on their journey but had not gone far when...

So, quickly restyling his hair, Rob asked the fairy Davemother what their quest was to be.   "Well," he said  "what you must do is..."

They all looked around in amazement, it was all there, the little yellow bricks, the house that crashed there cause dorothy hadnt passed drivers ed. and rob...in the red sparkly shoes which oddly suited him with the little pig tails and checkered dress he was wearing, however, thought Bri, red lipstick just isnt his colour! Rob blushed and a tear fell from his eye! Then bubbles began to appear and the fairy came to tell them their quest. You guessed it was gonna be Dave right? well you were completely....

Suddenly, Vicky flew in through the window, proclaiming:  "Put your fingers in your ears, hold your nose, and swallow three times!"  Rob did as she said; the result was instantaneous: Everyone started laughing, which didn't help.  Rob continued hiccuping, until he stopped.  Then he pulled out a...

Rob looked out at the empty, birdless sky and raised an eyebrow. Meanwhile Emily woke up in the back seat and saw that as the other two were arguing they were rapidly approaching a wall. There was nothing else she could do but...

He stared out his window and looked at a blue speck approaching him. As it got closer it grew in size till it became the car out of Harry Potter. With Bri in the driving seat Rob was apprehensive, but with a final look at his mess...cough...room, he got in the flying car which flew to the clouds, and was looking out the window once more when he realised there was another in the car. It was none other than....

      Once upon a time, Rob was really damn sexy. Lots of women had commented on this. They siad to him:   "Rob, you are a sexy bitch"  "thank you" said Rob  "Thou speakest truth" Said God.  And so, sitting in his enchanted glade, Rob was quite content with life. He just been sailing with a happy goblin, who was very happy.  In the heat of the day, Rob dozed off. He awoke a few hours later to the sound of smashing. Looking into his portable welsh dresser (where he kept all of his chinaware,) he saw something smashing. It was a piece of paper that said:  "Congratulations, Rob, you have won Â£1,000!"  It was the first time Rob had ever heard paper speak.    Reaching behind him, he picked up his phone, and rang his bank manager to tell him the good news.  They were celebrating together when suddenly...

      ok this is the random story 2 For this you cant post anything two times in a row, you have to wait for someone else to continue. comment on how good/bad the story is, the titles are the story. ALWAYS have a cliff hanger ending! here is the first random story so you get the idea: 1.	One day in chemistry Briony was trying to correctly wire up a plug. It then fell apart for the tenth time. She gave up and was staring out the window when... 2.	suddenly, an unconscious pupil fell through the roof, who was then followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun (oh no, it was actually Mrs Goodchild) 3.	The unconscious person remained still. Briony realizing it was Emily Cried out a prolonged Noooooo!!! When Emily got up and said why are you doing that? Briony fell into a shocked Huh wad-ju-yer-du-in-mmeh and was silenced by the nun... 4.	then, Briony thought of something. She hadn't done her massive 500-page essay, so (in her physics lesson, remember) she decided to get on with it. What was the title? Oh yes, "How to say hello in 500m words" Hmmmm.....she thought. Well, hello, guten tag, bonjour, hola,......um.............hmmm......... 5.	Briony spent the rest of the lesson pondering this strange task of hers. Emily personally thought that the essay was just created by the teachers as revenge. Briony was bought back to reality by a flying blue car outside the window, which had come to save both her and Emily. 6.	who was it? she wondered? Uhhh! It was Harry Potter in his flying car (remember the chamber of secrets?)! Wow! MY hero! Sighed Emily. How I do love you so! Oh get on with it said Briony. She was missing Adam. Sigh........... 7.	Harry turned to Briony and said 'I know that Emily is drop dead gorgeous but I'm afraid I can not date her due to a curse created by Voldemort. You how ever can both come with me and I will take you to Hogwarts where Adam is a pupil. Briony looking both sceptical and worried climbed into  the car, Emily took the front passenger seat, Briony the Back. The car then took off into the skies ... 8.	All of a sudden a strange knocking was heard apparently coming from nowhere. Briony still worried turned to Harry and asked what on earth it was. Don't worry said the alien as it turned around it's just my pet human Becky! 9.	Suddenly, Harry grew two ex-TREMELY large tentacles and started to eat Briony! Luckily, Adam was around to save her, and killed Harry. Meanwhile, Emily was fast asleep and dreaming of sticking pins in Daveâs privates. She woke up to find herself with Becky, Briony and Adam, in the sky, resting on what looked like a cloud. Have I died and gone to heaven? Wondered Emily. Meanwhile (again) Briony, Adam and Becky were all wondering what to tell Emily. Could they tell her that Harry Potter, her long loved lover, had turned into an alien and they had to kill him? Worse still, there was the matter getting down from the cloud; they thought they had killed Harry, but he was well enough to drive off after leaving them on a cloud in the sky. Hmm.....this was going to be a long night.......... 10.	Adam walked around pondering what to do and then fell through the clouds in a puff of smoke with the words 'oops I hit a soft spot'. Emily caught his wand in a flash and cast the wingardium leviosa spell saving Adam. She thought to herself well that shows my brother that the Harry Potter books ARE educational. Adam stuttered thanks, Emily put up hand and cast a spell to take them all to Hogwarts- unfortunately she sneezed part way through and they actually ended up at the worst possible place. You guessed it there were at .... 11.	Voldemorts secret palace in the middle of mount Doom where he was secretly conspiring with Sauron to take over the world. Briony on seeing such evil collapsed elegantly into the arms of yes youâve guessed it ADAM. Who on seeing her almost dying (well he thought so) declared his undying love for her, but fate was not looking fondly on the two young lovers as Sauron swooped down in a rather vampirish way to steal his love from Adams arms. With a cry of anguish Adam....... 12.	...........punched Sauron in the fangs and grabbed Briony. He pulled her (nicely) away from the evilness of Sauron and made sure everyone was alright (aww, isn't he nice!!!!) Anyway, back to the story....Adam quickly chanted a spell that took them all to a very magical romantic place. Everywhere they looked, there were very wonderful things that were so wonderful they couldn't be described. Adam decided to seize his opportunity and whisked Briony away from everyone so that they could be alone. Finally! But, just as they were about to go into the best snog ever in the world,.................................. HAVE FUN!!!

      ....the really spooky house on spooky island, she muttered something bout some clutz of a dog who somehow helped to solve mysteries and a bunch of kids who were so tacky that even the 60's rejected them. Vicky realised that if she was telling them not to go, of course that meant they would go, but she probably knew that they would do the opposite of what she said cos she was evil, meaning that she did want them to go cos perhaps there was a trap there like in Hanzel and Gretal, but if they knew this then they wouldnt go, but if she knew that they thought this, perhaps she was just trying to make sure that they didnt go cos she was hiding something there that she didnt want them to see. Vicky tried to explain this to the others and then proposed that they should go to the spooky house on spooky island. The others were to bemused to argue. The evil fairy tried once more to stop them saying, 'but i told you not to go!' Vicky started her explaination again but the fairy stoped her and said 'I'm going to classes now to be good, this was my good deed for the day!' Everyone looked at Vicky who said 'well so what, you dont get to meet a mystery solving dog everyday!' The others nodded and left the fairy woth her mouth hanging open behind them as they walked towards the port that had the boat to take them to spooky island. When they got there they looked at the boat, it was empty except for the captain who was a ....

      Huh?  Hmm.  I heard that Yellowcard backed out. This is a bad thing.  On that night, me and Penmo had fun scaring little children and acting like morons. It was much fun.  In about an hour I am going off to camp with Robbo and Penmo and we will have tremendous fun with Vicko and Brio (not to be confused with pens..) and whoever else who can be called "entertaining".  If they aren't as much fun as they're cracked up to be (I'll be the judge of  that ) then I'll just sit on my own playing pick-up sticks.  I am bringing pass-the-bomb with me.. That's bloody brilliant.  This is a long post. Probably because of the double linebreaks. Hohum.  Raawr!  Let's make it bigger.  Yes.

Some of those security dudes were harsh, they threw some of my mates around and stole one of my mates! Capdown and the AKA's rocked too! Although I thought capdown were alot better than the AKA's, but they were really good for supporting bands. But the bad thing was I came out covered in beer, water and ice cubes down my top. But it rocked!! \m/ Anyhoo..I'll shutup now. Today I had my literature exam, it sucked monkey butt because I didn't manage to finish it all :-( it's not right that we only have 1 hour 45 minutes to write 3 essays...grrrrr! I really hope I didn't do really badly. Tonight I'm watching the last ever friends god I'm excited. I'm getting ready to cry already...and it's 3:20pm!

And Vicky, but vicky has not actually written anything on here, so you don't really know her either. suffice to say ive known her for about 12 years for about 11 of which we never said a word to each other. Anyway, ive just been talking about photography with Tom, and also i can assure you that no procupines were invovled.

      I had a twin once.. Let's just say he's in a better place now.  I've noticed lots of moaning about exams. I will take this opportunity to say:  I have only four exams.  Yes! I only have to do four exams! Isn't that great? Though, uh, I do kinda have to go back afterwards to start doing A2.. :S

      awww I thought we were a team *grumble* Study leave is pretty sucky...and how come your exams start later than ours? That can't be fair. Oh well, less moaning, more pretending to revise... Lol, Dave smacked you in the eye? was it like a girly smack? I hate being hurt in the eye, it's never FUN! I went to watch Twin Wars at the school today, two hot, sweaty extremelly attractive twins fighting each other? (Might I add they were MALE!) It was pretty damn good...

Anyway, today i got study leave. my first exam is on tuesday, and my last on the same day as yours. hah. dave smacked me in the eye last night. it was fun.

The blog is a very important part of our friendship and ... how could she call herself a friend now? *a tear rolls down my face* We must make her! But how? I propose we set a wild porcupine on her until she writes something. Although this isn't too practical an idea. Any more?

      Well to be fair, I don't need to pull I have a whole load of guys lined up waiting for me to go out with them. I also lie. Maybe you guys should do what most low-lifes do online and make up a whole new personality. Not that you need to...err...hmm. I'd sleep with a guy that moaned about their day because that's what you call a turn-on. We love it when guys talk dirty...

      Yeah. Pulling was the idea I had in mind when I created this. I figured that if women saw a couple of people moaning about their day they'd go "Hey, he's moaning about his day. I like to sleep with people who moan about their day."  It hasn't worked yet.

      Im still at school, but today i had a funday. In fact, the only fun bit was listening to my own cds that i took in with me, but it was good nonetheless. Also, i got to show off my diaboloing skills at lunchtime, and you all know how great i am. My first exam is not til tuesday, and im not on study leave yet. Grrr. Probably tomorrow.

      Phew...at least that CD mystery has been solved, I couldn't sleep at nights! :-( So yesterday was my last day at school, and they decide to give us our first exam on the first day of study leave. So instead of making excuses about no exams yet and causing chaos on the streets, we have to stay in and revise. Je ne c'est pas juste! I write so damn much everytime. I went to pizza hut last night, hurrah! And...erm...no more smelly Lee or crazy Armstrong!

My french listening exam is soon and I'm pretty darn scared. Listening to the French is never fun. I'm going into town tomorrow which I'm going to have to make the most of as I have to see my Grandma on Sunday. She's lovely but she's so slow and I'm so impatient!

Ju Jitsu, Jujutsu, Jui Jitsu etc. The fact that there's so many variations is fucking shit. And I don't mean educational.

      Yep, seagulls suck, right enough. Some guys went seagull fishing on our field at school sometime. It was funny. I would like to hit a seagull as hard as I can, and then, when all the others swoop down for the body, I would detonate it, killing them too.  BTW, sadism toward animals is wrong, don't you think?

      Gluttons of the world, i ask you: how much easier is it to cram a handful of chips into your mouth without choking than it is to eat (looks haughtily down nose) potato wedges? chips! truly english.   Chips, chips, bad for your heart  but as for wedges, where do i start?  they are bad for you in the extreme;  they'll turn your insides to clotted cream  no-one will hear your silent scream  as you eternally sleep, of chips you shall dream.  Why did i eat wedges? why oh why?  you'll sit down there and start to cry  wedges are truly traitorous  a horrible use for the honest potatorus.

      But you see, it takes more effort to wash a potato and cut it into "wedges" than it does to make a rectangle. Also, the skin is left on jacket potatoes. Anything wrong with that? Potato wedges: perfect size for eating. Also, wedges can have a variety of flavours. With chips it doesn't seem to go down as well.  There could always be a new kind of shop:  "POTATO AND FISH" , hosting all kinds of potato products, including moonshine vodka. Yum. Vodka and chips. Or wedges as the case may be.

<date>03,May,2004</date>
<post>

    
       
      Well, thats as may be, but quite frankly the only purpose of the skin on a potatoe is to keep the earth out. The bit you are eating has been in direct contact with the soil, or it would have been if they were actually british, and not grown by some poor third worlder, with less income even than you. Also, i have yet to come acroos a chip that i could not fit into one mouthful. Of course, i cant be right. Because you see so many wedge and fish shops, but fish and chips... pah, its got no ring to it, you know?

      Chips better than wedges? I think you are wrong. Often, a potato wedge is better than a chip by far. Note: -The absence of potato skin on chips. This means that, not only is it better for you, but there is a holding property on the wedge found only on burnt chips, which are icky. -The "wedge" shape. Unique amongst potato based foods, the potato wedge's "wedge" shape grants consumers a far more stable structure. This means that not only is chewing more enjoyable as there is more to bite into, but also the surface means that it is better to get sauce onto.

      Well, today, I have done very little. I watched a film about some guys who were trapped in space and got rescued by Russians. I also gave not unconsiderable thought to how capitalist bastards are destroying hippies like myself. Admittedly I have only been a hippy for 3 days, and I don't smoke, or chain myself to trees, and casual sex... well, I just don't get the chance. But anyway, I was thinking about how we could make the insurance cheaper, and I have had the following idea, assisted by my wonderful mother. What we do is: Designate 2 drivers, and I would go for Vicky and Bri, since they are learning to drive even as we speak, but also because they have less insurance to pay because they are female, and also by the time of the trip they should, with care, have a few months of no claims too. Then we get my mum to by the insurance in her name, and nominate Vicky and Bri as drivers. We are not sure if this will work, but it might, and she has lots of no claims. This should lower the price considerably. Then, we divide the cost between everyone concerned, and life is good. After that, I may be able to foot the bill for most of the van, since this years EMA was mostly going to be saved up for a car, and a hippy van is far better. If anyone else, such as Penman actually manages to find a good job and wants to go parts with me, that's cool. Very few people could have thought this far ahead in the space of 2 days, so kudos to me for being obsessed  and  bored. What a long post that was. Apologies to anyone who this doesn't concern and just came here by accident, the rest of the blog is far more interesting, so read that. Cheers.

      I have some good and some bad news. The bad news is that i don't think we can borrow the vw. The good news is that we can buy a van for porbably under Â£50 each. Then we can paint it with sunflowers (yay) I admit this is a little more costly, but Â£50 is not that much. I may see some of you tonight, so I will talk more then. Also, my firend has a paintball gun, so we can be really  original  in our decorations. But, I don't know for sure that we can't have the VW, so we shall see.  Anyway, here is a logo I made in a moment of boredom:   Thanks to Olly for posting it, because Hello doesn't work for me.  Also look  urlLink  here  for a list of some festivals we could go to.   I am not obsessed, just bored.

      Well, today, me and the Dave's continued to hatch the daring scheme which I had on firday night.  The Gatevaulters' 2005 "Damn Vodka" tour. The DV tour will consist of the five of us  Vicky, Dave, Bri-y, Rob, (that's me folks), and Penmo.  We will go round various small music festivals and fields, in a VW campervan with lots of beer and other alcohol, being Hippies, and generally having a good time. Atm it rather dpends on me learning to drive and on something else which I can tell you but cannot write on here. Anyway, it should be a gd laugh. Start saving now, and learning to drive and other such things. We are about to venture onto the interweb to find some festivals which we can patronise. More details will follow... Money is important. Get a job if you are me, Dave, Bri, or Penmo, and get another one if you are Vicky.  PS, Carly, we have one more space for a woman on this tour. would you be interested..?

      So last night, Vicky and I went to the cinema at 'The Vue' (not Warner Village anymore folks). On the way there, we walked by some scary drunks and plenty of bastards from Plymouth, but that's to be expected when you wander through Plymouth anyway.. We got to the cinema, paid our money and went upstairs to queue for Shrek 2 in screen 9 (it starts at 8.00)  *90 minutes later, the film ends*  That film was damn good. The character depth is, once again, explosive. Puss-in-boots was a fantastic addition to the team. Usually when a character is added in a second movie, they tend to be a bit... shite. Shrek 2 kept its 'Shrek-ness' with its fairy tale gags.  All of the songs and singing worked very well. I have never heard 'I need a hero' work so perfectly :D  For the nerds: Shrek 2 kept the high standards of CG set by the original. At times you can swear it's real. The giant cookie guy (forgotten his name :S) was fantastic. Especially when he was sinking in the water.   All in all, a very good film.

      OMG, JAMIE CULLUM IS A GOD! he is sooooo damn god. Incredible. Support was good too, but the Cullumeister was just incredible!!! I loved it! It was amazing! if you ever get the chance to see him, do it! he is a legend! I am all happy, and it's all good. The intervals were a bit short though, which meant I had to down the best part of half a pint of Vodka and red bull. As Olly put it: "There's a straight line down there, and you're avoiding it at all costs."  I'm not lightweight though, no no no! Bri-y is, but that's not my problem. It was great, anyway. We stood up and clapped lots! He did high and dry, which was the most F**cking incredible thing ever. He had the whole crowd singing in three part harmony, and it sounded incredible! He kept running out ad touching a bit of carpet too, which was mental. he is a legend. I want to have his children. Yes Vicky, that means Dave is safe from me, at least for now... but as or the future, who knows? Anyway, enough of this kinda gay thing, but Jamie Cullum is a legnd. Yay! Yay! Yay! It was sooo good. And I met up with Carly, who, by pure coincidence was at the same bit of the bar as we were. Did you enjoy it CArlos? I thought it was f**cking incredible, which you may have guessed by now. Then we came back and watched the best bits of Glasto. If anyone saw Franz Ferdinand, I WANT HIS SHIRT!

      hello there! I haven't been on here for a while cos my pc has been playing up. But now 'm at Olly's house, so I'm typing form there. Anyway, last night I slid down a bank and landed (literally) flat on my face, with 11 stone of Rob behind me. It hurt, and my nose is now an interesting new shape. Admittedly, all members of this blog apart from Carly already no this, They were all there cept for Vicky, who said she wished she had been, because she is very nasty. Very nasty indeed. Horrible.   Anyway, Bri-y's frisbee throwing abilities have increased supremely, even with her dislocated elbow, which I am sympathetic about, even if people like Vicky aren't, because she is nasty. Very nasty. Nasty as hell. And that's pretty nasty. Anyway, Jamie Culum tonight! Woooo! Yay! If I see you there Carly, I will buy you a drink, because I am nice.

      Hello, I'm here to moan. I HATE THE PROM! God it's awful, and I haven't even been yet! I have a crappy dress I really do not like, I have to buy bloody heeled shoes and some dinky bag. I can't do it. Ok, I'm not some kind of tomboy-girl but I'm certainly not a girly girl and this prom is doing my nut. I'd rather have the money from this prom and go get myself a new phone or an MP3 Player (I could probably get both looking at the cost of all this)! Now, ok, it was my choice in the first place whether I went or not. But they are so good at persuading you - for a short amount of time you think it' will be great so you hand in all your money and grin for hours. The suddenly you realise, you're going to end up killing yourself. I'm just looking for the alcohol provided at my friends house before and after the prom. Boo hoo hoo! :(

      So, hello. It's me...grooowl. So a run down of todays events: 1) I woke up, ate, had a shower and headed to school for my history exam. The history exam was piss easy because it was a source paper and there wern't too many questions unlike last time &gt;:( ! 2) I went to see Mr Mathieson (or however its spelt) to get my sixth form induction sheet. Yeh thats right! I'm going to sixth form! ^.^ Hoorah! But now I'm not sure if I want to do french or not. Maybe I'll do biology? 3) I went to Pete's house (as if you all know him...) with Brownie, Dave, Kirsten and Steve. I don't like Steve much. We then travelled to Daves house to retrieve my monkey hoody...and then to Steves to check his dog wasn't dead ;) 4) We all went into plymouth, managed to get child tickets and headed to subways (mmmmm!) we then went about the shops and I got mocked for working in freezeways :( argh! 5) We went to the guitar shop and I sat there all jealous and grumpy 'cos I can't play. I really wish I could, I must learn. But first I must find enough money to pay for my guitar...and my new phone...and my MP3 player...and my Green Day T shirt. Life is SOOO unfair! - Kevin stylee 6) Came home, and wrote on here.  Now, I know that wasn't interesting but I'm bored as fuck, so live with it!

      I am lovely and Yayish again now. Listening to happy music has cured my depression. Yay! I am saying that a lot now. Some may say it is camp, but not to my face. And besides, it is no more camp than my shirt, the one with the pink stripes. Only 2 exams left now! Nearly there!

      Time to write some more stuff. Yesterday, Vicky and I walked the dogs. My dog surprised me. For some reason, she stayed next to me most of the time, wasn't too badly behaved and was just generally unusual.. Very odd. It was really weird when a very old dog with scabies or something, wandered past and the dogs went ballistic. Very odd.  Tomorrow I am going up to Waitrose for a job interview. (Wai'rose) Hopefully, tomorrow I will walk out of Waitrose with a job. I very desperately need it; I'm getting fed up of mooching off my parents. I also want to learn to drive, but I want to pay for lessons myself. Dilemma indeed..  Today, I had one lesson because I'm dropping maths and my sociology teacher went on an art trip... :| Right now, I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand and eating lollipops. Hurrah!

      Had no sleep last night, and three science exams this morning. What a great combo that was. I am pissed off with boats. Just as Penman is getting used to how to sail it, and I am too, it fucking breaks  again . Oh well. I  hate science, but if I have passed them, I have just done my last ever peace of science. Yay! Kind of yay anyway, cos if I fail I have to retake them. Cue ppl saying, it'll be fine and I won't fail. God I am pissed off with exams. Grrrr! Damn them into hell, or hades or some other rather unpleasant place. Birmingham, for instance.

      Today I had my Home Economics exam. Simple pimple. I then went to find out if the school had got off their arse to get the bastard who stole my mobile phone. The receptionist looked nervous and told me she'd ring me at 11.30am, it is now nearly 3pm and she hasn't called. Grrrr! So anyway I'm grounded (stupid time and it's stupid...time) so I'm sat here in my duvet wishing my life away...  I need some non-kinky entertainment right now...

      This morning I had breakfast at 12:15, which was in fact the aftrenoon. it was, however, almost exactly 12 hours after I went to sleep.  Hooray. My dad is just making me some cofee. What a nice chap he is.  Anyway, I noticed this morning, that since I put my hotornot pic on here, my rating has gone from 8.9 to 7.7. I do not know who I have to thank for that, but I  will  slap them. They clearly don't like Orlando Bloom. God I am rambling. I should really stop now, but when I do, I will have to start revising, so I'll keep on a bit longer.  In 48 hours  I will have just 1 exam left. Yay! Here are my exams: Tuesday morning: Seperate Sciences Wednesday Morning: History 2 Tuesday afternoon: RE that is a total of 4 hours left. Thats all! Yay! Woo! etc.   Thank you for taking the time to read all that. I appreciate it.

      I prodded Dave! ^.^ right in the arm!! thats the most exciting thing I did all day as I had to work...OH DEAR GOD! I really was not made to earn a living. I work in the new Freezeways shop in Fore St. I have to work on my own with a bunch of old people who want cheap frozen goods. gah! It was so boring and so hot and I had to tidy and do boring, boring things. I love to rant! Also, my boss is a mixture of David Brent and Wallace from Wallace and Gromit. It cracks me up! so anyway life is boring at the moment. My mobile phone got stolen :-( I can't remember if I told you guys before but I'm SOOOOO annoyed!!! Damn Saltash Community school bastards. I cried - and I NEVER cry! Sorry I'm blabbing, but, shush. There are some really good films coming out which I must see at some point - Shrek 2, Garfield the movie (he rocks ok!!), Spiderman 2 (better be better than the first) and Thunderbirds the movie (come on, you can't say your not a little tempted?) Oh and one final point. I HATE THE BLACK EYED PEAS!!!! ARRRGRRHHGHHHHH! Au revoir

      I am also not hungover! No surprises there.  I can honestly say that I am not going to be going to bed at 2.30 ever again; I don't go to sleep until about 4-5 o'clock. For shame.  I am still waiting to see this reminder that Vicky put on my phone last night (I haven't looked yet!) and really can't be bothered to eat anything.. Damn alcohol.  In other news, I managed to actually tell my dog to bring me a lollipop about 10 minutes ago. How good is that? She didn't refuse to give it to me or anything! Now I just have to get her to bring me drinks.. Â¬_Â¬  Also, now that I have my computer back, you can all start sending me stuff. Like photos :D

      Yay! I'm not hungover! Woooo! I have mysteriously cut my knee though. Last night was very good. We filled a water cooler with beer, but Vicky would not let me drink out of the tap. Grrrr. Anyway, It was good. Briony is clearly the legend of Twister. (she actually fell over  before we started and that takes skill) Hope your parents don'tread this though Bri...   Also, what the hell is up with John Smith's? It has one of them widget things in it, so the can froths all over the place, and then when you drink it, the first 2 inches or so is head. It's ridiculous.  Ho hum. I'm going out now, so I will see you all later. It's raining.  Oh and kudos to me for writing so much so early in the morning.

      Hello party people in the house, as some kinda rapper probably once said. Me and Penmo went sailing this morning, and it was very fun. The boat broke a bit, but we'll fix it. It was soooooooo fast. we only capsized 5 times though!  Tonight I will drink a fair bit, and I have eaten little all day, so it could be quite interesting.

      What's that sound? Could it be cheering? I hear a celebration!  Yes! That's right folks, I'm back!  No more boring evenings without me!  The full blogging team!  And best of all!  Lots of linebreaks.  What have I done this week? Sat in a boring house mostly. Monday was the first day back at school. I was not happy.  On tuesday I went up to aylesbury to see my brother's RAF passing-out parade. It was good. There was a nice travel inn that we (me and my family) stayed in the monday night. We had a nice meal and there was this huge dessert thingy! Yum. Ultimate Chocolate Challenge, I salute you.  Wednesday I was back at school again and at Ju Jitsu, as he has already said, I nearly killed Rob! Take that you bastard! Or, y'know, don't.  The rest of this week I have been thinking about dropping Maths and picking up Art or Psychology. Both would be fun.  Party tonight at Bri's house. I don't know where it is! Huzzah! Vicky's hand will guide me true.   Is this a long post? Yes. Is it because of the double line breaks? Yes. Do I care? Not a great deal, no.  Yum.

      Last night I had JuJitsu. Dave threw me badly, I landed badly, and almost died. My eyes stopped working and so did my breathing. Remember this, people; Breathe out when you hit the floor.  Aside from that, I have 4 exams left, Namely RE, Science, History, and RE. Damn catholic schools. My last exam is a week on tuesday, and I will slap anyone who takes the piss because they finished before me.  Wow, three sections to this post. I am going to see Jamie Cullum live at the pavillions a week on Friday. He is so good. (I will also slap anyone who takes the piss out of Jamie Cullum.) Then my exams finish on tuesday, and it's time for me to go sailing, everyday, 9-5. While you damn As people are still in school.  HAHA . Apologies to Vicky, That laugh was mainly aimed at Bri. Even though she was actually quite sympathetic last night when I told her Dave almost killed me. So, I am sorry. I take back that laugh. It was nasty. Bad Rob...

      I just had french too. Some guy shouted something out and got us kept behind for an hour afterwards, so I am going to have words. Harsh words. Words backed up by the blunt boney things I carry on the ends of my wrists. What a twat. Some swills did it too, but wouldnt admit, and now our head of year is calling up the exam board. Grrr, Rob is  ANGRY

Ah well, a game of footy tonight and a "end of exmas" celebration on Sunday with plenty of alcohol and my favourite lame-ass lads ^.^ YAYYYYY (even though my last exam isn't til next week...but shhhh!)

      Well, today I had my English exam. My last English exam. My last  EVER English exam. Hooray! Unless I have fail and have to retake it of course. It's irritating, I keep coming home and saying "That was my last bit of (insert subject here) ever" and he keeps saying "unless you fail". It's pissing me off. Anyway, today I spent lots of time diabloing, I'll put some pics on here sumtime.

      Yesterday I played football. Thats right..I..played..football! I surprised myself. Obviously I wasn't good at playing football, but it was fun until I cut my leg. Ouch. A "male friend" of mine went away this morning to France :( damn France, they take everything! Its going to be weird not talking to him every night and now I'm feeling kinda lonesome *looks around for sympathy...gah!* But anyhoo, today I've been revising out in the sun for my darned science exam tomorrow. I've never really been able to REVISE so to speak, I've merely just skipped through the pages and remembered random sentences such as "polar bears have large paws to spread out on the ice and snow". Maybe this is why I suck. Wish me luck for tomorrow *laughs nervously*

      Okay. So last night went off without a hitch. We probably should have played far more games than we did, and getting more drunk would have been a bonus. But I had fantastic fun so I say it was successful  Rob throwing up was funny though. And the smelly place was cool. And skipping around is always entertaining.  There's plenty of leftovers too. Yum.

Last night me and and my friends had a BBQ on chapel field with some drink...well maybe alot of drink. I pleasantly enjoyed it. Well...until I fell into a bush of stinging nettles with my friend Pete. Yeah, we're in pain...it's not funny! What else? Ohh..I'm still doing the ol' GCSE's. You know what? In the past 5 years I think I've meant to be learning about all the religions out there. I still know nothing about any of them. So anyway, basically, I failed my RE GCSE *laughs inside* yeah...maybe I'll regret that. But I have history coming up which is quite worrying because I want to do well in that...A* people!! And someone said something about penis enlargements?? I think I'm going to need that...(don't ask) Anyhoo there is your blab, I'll have a whole bunch of additional blab for next time Warly xx

I love them to death.)  Save Ferris  ... ... (Dermot O' Leary was wearing a t-shirt this morning. Hmm)  The Toasters  ... (Yum. Talk Is Cheap makes me leap. Heh. Rhyme.)  Ska-P  ... ... ... ... ... (for Cannibis mostly.. crazy Spaniards)  The Hippos  ... ... (Though they seem really "skatey", they're quite catchy.)  Sublime  ... ... ... ... (Oooh. Versatility! Though most of it's ska, they have other stuff too. Sexy, no?)   Other stuff that's fun:   The Donnas  ... ... (E2: "They're called a metal-inspired punk band and a classic rock and roll band." All women? Yes. Live with it. They're hot and good.)  Elastica  ... ... ... ... (Anybody here who says Connection is rubbish can burn in a fucking hole.)  Yellowcard  ... ... ... (Not a lot of bands have violinists. Yellowcard do. I like them. Powder. Mmm.)  [spunge]  ... ... ... ... (There are a lot of square brackets on this forum, so embrace [spunge]. Where the hell did you think I got my name from anyway?)  Monster Magnet  ... (Maybe they aren't everybody's cup of tea, but Heads Explode makes me laugh. Powertrip just makes me go "woooh".)

Isnt it terrible when you come out of an exam thinking "well that wasnt too bad" and everyone else is like "Omg, that was crap" and you're thinking... I must have got it all wrong. This is not a good thing. Still, I only have 20 mins of exams tomorrow. then i will do something else. God knows what... just hope my dad lets me go to ju jitsu in the evening. Good god, that was the most boring post i have ever written.

      *gasp*  I finally got round to posting! It took a whole night for me to feel like doing it, but I'm doing it again. Take THAT, Rob.  What's this? Films? Well, guess what I've heard! A new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film! The old one is rubbish.. In this new one, Johnny Depp stars. Hurrah! We like him. He acts like some kind of good actor or something. Tim Burton directs! Sha-pow! Do I think it could be a good film? Yes. It could be the best film ever if the A-Team appeared though. "I'll just have a glass of milk, foo'" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA DO YOU SEE? MR. T!  Ahem.  What other films... I look forward to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy too. It looks like it'll be good maybe if possibly it works just a little bit well.  Shaun of the Dead is your god. It is quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. Though the Matrix still has a special slot in my heart.  Bruce Almighty should have been better. (They used up all the good jokes in the trailer really..)  Hannibal is fucking weird. (Puffy men and people eating their own brains.. You tell me that that's a normal film..)

      I've never heard of new found glory. Would I like them? The BBQ was good :-) not much news there to be honest. But...today I went to see Harry Potter with my friends Joe, Tim and Andy. I was yet again disappointed. It might be because I think the books are over-rated but meh. Ok, actually, I think it is the acting. God that Daniel Radcliffe can't act for his life. I have to say he has improved slightly but I still want to steal his big thickly-rimmed glasses and play Harry myself. It frustrates me! Also, the guy that plays Ron. I have to say he was pretty good in the first two films he over-acted at just the right time. But in this film he does it constantly.  The direction was better though, thanks to the new dude. He should re-do the first two films again that direction really did need improving. They should replace Harry potter too! The guy that plays Sirious Black was great though! in fact, fantastic! Maybe he jsut made everyone else look shit? Oh well.

Those of you who know me may think this is not my kind of music, and those of you who don't may also think it out of pure spite. Anyway, i like them, and the next time i get some money, I will get one or more of their albums. Or maybe I won't there are only 2 songs that ive heard, after all.

What do you think my weakness is? 9. Whoo you think I'll get married to? 10. Where do you see me in 10 yrs time? 11. What do you think is my ideal occupation? 12. What reminds you of me? 13. If u could give me anythin, what wud it be? 14. When's the last time you saw me? 15. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 16. Describe me in one word. 17. Do you think our relationship is getting stronger, weaker, or staying the same? 18. If it were to 2 b da last day of my life..wad wld b da last thing u wanna tell me  Seriously, why do people have time to writ this kinda crap?

That means keeping my revision notes by my side at all times but kind of forgetting they're there. Oh well. Tomorrow I'm going to my mates birthday BBQ/Partay. The problem is it's a birthday and I don't know what to get him. Plus...it's TOMORROW! any ideas? I'd be very, very grateful! poor you Dave...get well soon!

But when my mum saw me she instantly asked if I was unwell, because I had funny coloured skin or something.  Damn vodka. Damn it to hell!

      Yeah, it was good. And, if anyone ever tells you you are a lightweight, say unto them:  "Look at Briony!" hehe anyway, im not hungover and thats the main thing. hope i get my cds back off dave. Life is good, and so is jumping across streams. But Briony could not hug me because my phone is not a pencil.

      Ok. Last night, I feel, went very successfully. I can't for the life of me remember how much I drank; I wasn't keeping track. Though, judging by the bottles on the floor, I must have drank a fair bit. The worst bit for me was when I got into bed though. That's when the vodka kicks in and I start rolling around all dizzy. Then about an hour after I threw myself towards the toilet to chuck it all out again.  Lush.  Damn vodka..  Rob sent me interesting texts. "Ok. In away now in tryna sleep", "Im ducked. You shoulda got pissed.", "I finl in ripped ignore o."  I think he was pissed.

      If you are doing a case study on Rio de Janeiro, you should talk about Duran Duran's Rio. That has everything you ever need to know about Rio.  *dances* Tonight will be fun. Unless, y'know, something lame happens. Like a... car!

      I have a case study for Rio de Janeiro. Anyway, i have just been outside sitting on an uncomfortable fence, doing bugger all. But there we go. I am bored. Anyone who sees me tonight will have the privilage of seeing me in my incredibly camp shirt.

      Gosh. That's a lot of posts. Last night I  did  go to Jujutsu. It was very exhausting. Especially after putting up tents all day. Then afterwards I went to a party. There was not nearly enough alcohol as I returned home sober. Once again. Though there was a guitar to entertain myself with.. If only the alcohol hadn't nulled my senses enough to make me forget how to play everything I know. I have trouble remembering without being intoxicated.

      Wow! So much posting! Amazing! IncreablÃ© as the french would say if they had any sense. Anyway, i couldn't go to Ju jitsu last night which was a shame. Damn thumb. Anyway, tonight i shall drink, and those around me shall drink and there shall be much rejoicing. (unless you are all manic depressants.) and yes, it is very brave of you to keep writing, Ms Squires.

      Hmmm...I feel like an outsider yet still I continue to write! How brave am I? *cough I agree with Briony, that alcohol has to be shared Rob...it's just not good for you! well, I suppose we have other girls now that write on here beside myself. Kat could never really bothered and her lack of effort was getting me down. Really down. Anyhoo, today I revised science and let me tell you that there are 23 pairs of chormosomes in each cell, and in each gamete (sex cell) there are 23 chrosomes. Interesting huh? I also went to my local (crappy) youthclub and...well...blabbed on for rubbish for hours. Life is good, life is fine.

      And I found my CDs. And pass the bomb. All is good again. I will copy ACDC later on too..  Tents was tremendous fun, though I sense all that time in the sun has gone to waste.. again. Damn near untannable, muscular, sexy, toned body...

      Today we were taking down tents. owing to a miscalculation on my part, my thumb has been sprained and i can't go to ju jitsu tonight. how annoying. anyway, we also bought copius amounts of bacardi, smirnoff archers and reef. those who know what its for know, those who don't do not. long may this happy state remain.

      Hey hey kids! I am saying that sort of thing a lot these days. I will stop, unless anyone likes it.  Anyway, I have Ash's new album, and it is absolutely great! Buy it, or you shall perish! Ahahaha!  I also have the audiobully's album, but I don't expect you to have heard of them, because you think dance is $hit. (VICKY!) ahem.  That is good too. I also got the last Discworld Novel that I haven't read, and one of those cool  urlLink  Airzooka  things. It is very cool, but my dog doesn't like it.     In 2 days The Daves (like the hives, only different) and myself are off to Campedowne, which I cannot spell. There we will scuba dive, mong, talk and miss you all terribly. For those of you who wish to get in touch, our mobiles will be turned on on the evening, but not anytime else to conserve battery. If we do not reply, assume one of the following:       We have no battery left     We have no credit left     We are dead         Our phone has been stolen     We hate you (only joking, hahahahaha! Had you for a minute, but I can see we didn't fool you really, you canny bugger. :-D)    Anyway, you will be without us for 9 days! NINE WHOLE DAYS! We will miss you all terribly, and I'm sure you will pretend to miss us too.    Rob  xXx      </post></Blog>
