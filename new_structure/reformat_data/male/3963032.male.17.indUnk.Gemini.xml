      After a three-day hiatus, I have returned to you all. With nothing good to say. I spent a couple days in Niagra Falls visiting colleges and staying up all night on the Canadian side of Niagra Falls. God, I love Canada. Now I return. Tonight I spenta lot of time in front of the television. First, I watched a lot of the Democratic National Convention. I watched all of the speeches (I watch on C-SPAN so I don't get any of those CNN or Fox News morons cutting in on the speeches). I seriously doubt John Kerry's skill at public speaking, but he has a good enough record to get my vote, if I were just 7 months older. If anyone reading this lives in southern Illinois, go vote for Barack Obama for Senator. This man deserves not only to be in the Senate, but if he ever runs for President, I'd vote for him. Unfortunately, unless this ignorant country can overcome their racial problems, he may never get that opportunity, although he deserves it. I then watched the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, which was funny, as usual, and at the Convention. I'd reccommend it to anyone... Monday-Thursday @ 11:00 P.M. on Comedy Central. Then I watched The Tonight Show, where Jay had Michael Moore was his lead guest. Michael Moore is my idol. I definitely don't want to look like the guy, but he has the best message in the world. Go see Fahrenheit 9/11 if for any reason you haven't at this point. It will win Academy Awards, so at least you can say that you saw it.

      I can make jokes. Oh, man, could I make jokes about Mike Tyson. But I'll spare the guy. After watching the ESPN Outside The Lines show and witnessing how bad off Mike's got it, I'll spare the guy. Everyone should do the same. This guy is an asshole. I'll give you that. He's arrogant and ignorant. He's a money-grubbing scumbag. But he doesn't deserve what's happened to him. Mike Tyson is now living in a house smaller than my own. That's strange. Mike Tyson. The same guy who had more money than he could count a decade ago. Now he lives in a modest three-bedroom, two-bathroom house like you and I. Except he is in millions of dollars of debt. Millions. Not hundreds or thousands, but millions. Poor Mike. Of course, that could all be part of Mike's plan. This guy is smarter than we give him credit for. Now he's "Poor Mike" and not the rapist asshole Mike that we're accustomed to. Now millions of people around the world (including myself) will pay the ridiculous fee of $45.00 to watch Tyson humiliate himself on live TV. The match might not even last ten minutes. British heavyweight champion Danny Williams has a pretty damn good chance that he will completely kill Tyson. Possibly even literally. At this point in Tyson's life, he shouldn't be out in the ring fighting. He's not physically prepared, and certainly not mentally ready. It's too late for Tyson to quit while he's ahead. Mike Tyson just needs to quit while he's not dead.

      I don't fucking have any idea what's wrong with me. I'm always anxious... I guess that's the word for it. I always have the feeling that I should be doing something other than what I'm doing at any given moment. Like there's something more important that I'm always not doing. It's fucking insane, and it's really getting to me. I've had problems with depression my whole life, and took meds for it for a while, but I don't anymore. They never really seemed to help, they just kinda fucking knocked me out. Basically, they gave me the same kind of feeling I have when I drink too much alcohol. I don't know if this is depression or fucking what... I just am counting down the days in my head until I go back to school, my final days of freedom, and I'm dreading school. It's not that I don't have enough friends, or I don't have enough stuff to do there, it's just the whole atmosphere of it is what gets me. I can't stand it. I keep telling myself it will get better in one more year, once I'm at college, but I know it fucking won't. College will just be the same thing with more sex and more work. I'm in no need of more of either one of those. I don't know what it is I need. Maybe medication. Maybe just... I've got no clue. I need to see a psychiatrist or something. It's like I'm constantly angry with life, I'm always mad. And I'm really not, but it just feels that way. It's not teenage angst or any of that bullshit. I'm just not happy with my life the way it is, and I don't know how I can change it. Geoff tells me this is just my post-breakup stress, but I don't buy that bullshit because I only went out with her for a month or so. I'm just sick of life. I don't contemplate suicide, or any dumb shit like that, but I just get angry with myself sometimes...

      ... Music piracy to be specific. Isn't it fucking awesome? Yet even now I'm somewhat afraid that those RIAA Nazi-like evil dudes are gonna hunt me down eventually. My excuse will be that even since I started downloading music I've purchased hundreds of albums, even more than I bought  before  I started downloading music. The main stuff I download is stuff you can't buy in stores around here in Cleveland. Stuff from Canada, Australia, etc. Things like Powderfinger. For example, today I was searching online stores trying to find Powderfinger's most recent album, 'Vulture Street.' No such luck. Well, kind of. Amazon has it, they're just charging $33 for it, and I personally don't think each song on the album is worth $3 apiece. So I resorted to downloading it. See? If stores would carry more variety in their music, I would buy more music, and therefore download less. It's simple, guys. Until then, WinMx is my best option.

      I thought I might keep arguing with those ESPN morons... This week they're debating who is the greatest coach in the past 25 years. Sincethey limit themselves to the last 25 years, Red Auerbach is out of the discussion. Dean Smith comes to mind as the best college basketball coach, with Mike K from Duke being a close second. The best baseball coach has got to be Joe Torre, whether I like it or not, although Tom Kelly is one of my personal favorites. In pro basketball, I think Phil Jackson deserves the honor, although I am a huge fan of Pat Riley. In college football I think Joe Paterno is the hands-down favorite. Pro football is probably the most difficult, though. Bill Parcells, Bill Cowher, Joe Gibbs and others have to be considered...

      You tell me to bust a flow  But I tell you I gots to go  Yet you still insist  Watch out cause Iâm gonna get pissed  Iâm gonna blow up like Chernoble  Cause thatâs how the cookie fucking crumbles  I donât pack a gun cause that shitâs for pussies  You wanna fuck around, you worthless rookie?  You just messed with the master  Fucking get your face plastered  This is how it comes out  When youâre hearing it from a dude with clout  You better not stand up and shout  Cause Iâm superior without a doubt    I told you to back down  But youâre looking with a frown  Youâre looking like a clown  You need a fucking nightgown  And a blanket to keep you warm  Cause you ainât had a bitch since you was born  And if you still wanna fuck around  Iâll beat your ass down  Iâll mess up your fucking rack  With only a thumb tack  You better fucking watch your back  For this massive attack

      Fuck the CIA, man. What the hell do they do that actually helps this country do shit? Fuck âem! They give us all this âintelligenceâ on terrorists, which now seems to be somewhat of an oxymoron, with the emphasis on the âmoronâ (George Tenet). I have a perfect idea for the government. Screw the CIA. Get rid of âem. I got your number one spy: My Grandma. Goddamn yes! Sheâll fuckinâ hunt down any terrorist you want with a pair of fucking binoculars and a chair. She is incredible, man. She can tell you everything about her neighbor across the street. She knows his name, his friends names, what he does for a living, where he is, what heâs been working on in his house, what he needs to do outside, where heâs been, how many people are in his house, who is dad is, what he does for a living, where his dad lives, who his girlfriend is, what kind of car she drivesâ¦ ANYTHING. And sheâs never even fucking met the guy. Goddamn it, if the government only figured this one out. Grandmas are all you need. They got some of the best fucking spy skills in the world. Theyâll lure the terrorist with COOKIES!!!    Another thing Iâve been thinking about is the Cold War. I saw this thing on NOVA today (YES, I proudly watch PBS every once in a while) about all of these submarines that went down during the Cold War. They were all of these spy submarines, and we had them, the Soviets had themâ¦ What did we really get from them? What intelligence or secret stuff did we get from the Soviets? What did we ever do with it, if there was any intelligence? Because it appears to me that all of those hundreds of billions (with a B) of dollars were spent on listening to the Soviets talk about hockey. The Cold War was the biggest waste of time of any historic event in the history of the world. We spent half a century basically peeping on each other.    I got the diet plan for you guys. Caffeine. Hell yeah! See, let me explain. I have figured out that caffeine is a hunger suppressant, so hereâs what I do in the morning: I get up; eat no breakfast, but suck down three or four highly-caffeinated beverages (coffee, Mountain Dew, iced tea, iced coffee, or mix and matchâ¦) and thatâs it. Iâm good to go till about 9 P.M. Itâs the fucking miracle diet, guys. Screw the pills, just buy some Jolt.

      ESPN, in their neverending series of lists entitled "ESPN 25," posed the question of who was the worst sports flop in the past 25 years. I had to think about this one, but I think I've got a few. Jim Druckenmiller comes to mind to kick things off. Man, I bet the 49ers fans just cringed. Ryan Leaf is another one of the worst. The comparisons to Peyton Manning straight out of college probably sucked for him, because Peyton's probably Hall Of Fame bound, and Leaf is already out of football. Michael Jordan as a baseball player might also top the list, because he was just so bad. He struggled to bat above the Mendoza line (if that reference doesn't register, look it up) and he was only playing for the lowly AA Birmingham Barons. If you were supposedly the greatest basketball player ever, would you waste one of the years of your prime playing a sport that you sucked at? Or how about Sam Bowie, the guy the Portland Trailblazers took just ahead of MJ in the 1984 NBA draft? After about half a dozen surgeries, Bowie was essentially out of basketball ten years later, after only playing about four or five injury-free NBA seasons, basically as an average center. Rick Ankiel (remember him?) has to also come in near the top of the list. After being hyped up to unbelievable levels in the minors, he didn't disappoint during his first year in the bigs. However, when crunch time came later in the season (I believe it happened in the playoffs) Ankiel couldn't find the strike zone. He could barely even find the catcher's mitt, setting all kinds of records for amounts of wild pitches. He kept this up the next season (2001) and was demoted to the minors, and has yet to return. Or how about Ryan Anderson, or the so-called "next Randy Johnson," the 6'11 skinny kid the Mariners hyped up in 2000 after they selected him with the first pick in the previous year's draft. He blew out his arm and has yet to make it to the majors. Or how about the overhyped "clean-cut kid" Josh Hamilton, who has struggled with drug addiction and has yet to make it to the bigs for Tampa Bay (although he may still do so, and the recent signs are promising.)? The list could go on and on. I'm not going to waste my time waiting for ESPN to tell me who they think is the biggest, though.

      Life fucking sucks. I will present you with a situationâ¦ For example, I paid 39.99 for a new basketball, a really expensive cool one with the pump built in. So my brother thinks itâs real cool, right? So I let him use it. So what does he do? He loses it in a fucking rosebush. Then I climb in and get it out for him. Then he loses it again in the same rosebush and âforgetsâ to tell me. Then, three weeks and countless rainstorms later, Iâm looking for my basketball. He pretends not to know where it is, and then is surprised to find it exactly where he left it three weeks ago. Thanks, bro. I only got one more year with these people, and then I am moving my ass out of here faster than you can say âlife sucks.â    In other news in my lifeâ¦    MUSIC! I was watching MTV2 last night (okay, I admitted it). I only watch one show on MTV, and thatâs âSubterranean,â the show for all the music MTV classifies as âundergroundâ or âindie,â or in other words, the good music that they never play on any of their normal shows. So anyway, there were some especially good music videos last night (if you can catch it still, I recommend you do so). I am a big fan of the Onelinedrawing song âWe Had A Deal.â The show also rekindled my love for the Sam Roberts song âWhere Have All The Good People Gone.â I found it strange that Roberts made it onto an MTV show, since I donât believe his albums are even available in U.S. stores. Roberts is an âindieâ rocker who is immensely popular in Canada but has gone unnoticed in the U.S. (similar to artists like The Tragically Hip, Powderfinger, and Matthew Good). I was also surprised when a Matt Good video popped up on Fuse last week. It was âHello Time Bombâ off of âBeautiful Midnight,â Goodâs only attempt at success in the U.S.  I smell hot dogs, and I really have nothing left to talk about, so Iâm outâ¦

      Cell phone companies. My God, are they bad. It is to the point now where, during the middle of a weekday, it is cheaper for me to send a text message than to make a phone call --- enough cheaper that it actually makes it worth the while. Which is saying a lot, considering that on my cell phone you actually have to hit the '1' key twelve times just to get a period. Straining like that is bound to cause laziness. However, some of us have become excessively lazy. For example, when typing an instant message on the computer, most people feel that it is SO much easier just to substitute the number '2' for the word 'to'. As if the extra keystroke would kill us. We have become so lazy that 'you' has become 'u'. I do it too, so I'm as guilty of this as the next guy, but it just doesn't make much sense.   But back to cell phones. What gets me is the cell phone plans. Nights and weekends... You know when I make my calls? DURING THE DAY! Have you ever heard of a day plan? No? That's because they don't exist. Hey, I have a life on nights and weekends, and I don't really want to spend it on the phone. But, alas, all of those free minutes will go by on weekends and nights without me using them and I will continue to pay 30 cents a minute during the day to make my phone calls. They're raping us and we're letting it happen, folks...

      Summer... It's supposed to kinda be care-free, right? That's how you envision it throughout the entire school year anyway, but once you get there, it ain't so fun. Maybe I have some type of anxiety problem, eh, I don't know...  In other matters...  Anyone out there thinking of buying shit from MapleMusic... fuckin don't. Back on June 16th I ordered two Matt Good t-shirts and the new Matt Good CD and a CD from The Trews. I paid a total of CDN$67 (I don't have any fucking clue what that is in US dollars...), and that includes premium shipping. So... a box finally shows up TWO WEEKS later with a packing slip stating that all of the shit is in there. Guess what? It fuckin isn't. The two t-shirts are there, but neither CD is in there. So I assume that another box is coming, right? So I waited... and waited. And when I finally got fed up I sent MapleMusic emails. Four to be exact. That was two weeks ago. They never responded. I left two messages with them on their overpopulated voicemail, receiving no response. So finally one day I managed to corner them, and I explained my situation and they finally fucking shipped the package YESTERDAY. That's right. I ordered June 16th. It shipped July 18th. Ouch.

      Now you're reading. Why are you reading this? Either I pissed you off enough that you finally gave into my demands and came here or you're just as boring as I am. My opinion is that boring people should come together and be boring together. Power to the boredom.  Okay, enough of the bullshit. Here's what I'm gonna do. If you expect to find out everything about my life in here, you've come to the wrong place. Just give up. If you're bored, stoned, drunk, sleepy (asleep possibly), pissed off, angry, sad, happy, or anything else, you've come to the right place. I'm probably gonna ramble on about random shit, so be ready for... random... shit. Politics are bound to creep their way into my ramblings, so be ready for that too. I will ramble about politics, music, movies, my life, etc.  Bored yet? If you're not, you're better than me, because I'm bored out of my mind. I PROMISE it won't suck this bad all the time.

      The Olympics are a special time, arenât they? Only during the Olympics does NBC drop their entire late night lineup for water polo and synchronized diving. Whoop-de-fucking-do. And at any hour of the day (or night, for that matter) you can catch some Olympic action on TV. The TV schedule for yesterday was such that at any given second during the day there was a minimum of two different events on at the same time. NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, USA, Telemundo, Bravo and all sorts of NBC-affiliated networks carry the Olympics at different times of day. Who cares? After watching the USA Olympic basketball team lose to an island roughly the size of Delaware (Puerto Rico), I am officially disinterested. 92-73 was the final score in a game brought to you by the words âselfishâ and âIverson.â AI needs to get benched. Itâs all his fucking fault. Allen Iverson is a cancer on any team, and we really donât need him to win. A backcourt of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James is better than one with a selfish player like AI, who managed to hit five of his many shot attempts today (I believe the final count is fourteen). Plus, the reunion of coach Larry Brown with AI cannot possibly be a good thing. Since they fought in Philly, who is to say that things are any better now? Perhaps the reason is the style of play is different elsewhere, and we don't play it well. But you simply just can't tell me that Puerto Rico has better basketball than the USA. So, in that case, what's wrong with the team???

      I am finally back. My triumphant return from a week in hell. Vacations suck, donât they? All of mine have this year. My week in Canada was full of rain, boredom, and frustration with the people around me. My week in the Adirondacks was just full of rain. Tons and tons of rain. I had been looking forward to being able to kayak around Lake Kushaqua and the surrounding areas, but was not able to do so, thanks in large part to torrential downpours that never seemed to end. I did manage to summit one mountain (Mount Azure), where I discovered an awesome view (if you can withstand the wind) atop the fire tower on the summit. I brought a bike, which, due to the rain, I was only able to use a few times. In ADDITION to my wonderfully awful week, during the middle of the trip my CD player decided that it wanted to cut its life short. For some fucking reason, it just decided to stop working. I bought the thing on July 30, 2003 and it lasted me approximately 375 days. Thank you Sony, that really was worth my 70 fucking dollars. One fucking year. Thatâs all their quality products manage to last. And since it was an âATRAC3â CD player, Sonyâs special format of audio compression that lets you fit oodles of music onto one CD, I am forced to really only consider another Sony of the same kind. And itâs still gonna put a 60 dollar dent in my already-empty pocket. I was hoping to purchase Madden NFL 2005, the Kill Bill Vol. II DVD, and new CDs from Nonpoint and Clutch in the coming weeks, but now I am going to have to do some serious money management. I figure Madden and/or Kill Bill will come first. Of course itâs just my luck that something like this would happen in such an inopportune moment. In other less-depressing newsâ¦ I was watching Subterranean againâ¦ Onelinedrawingâs video seems to be making a weekly appearance on the show, which is definitely good. Other highlights from the show included Piebaldâs new video and some MTV airplay for The Thermalsâ video âHow We Knowâ (I HIGHLY recommend this song, and also the bandâs latest album, entitled âFuckinâ Aâ)â¦  â¦  I also had a lot of time to think about shit while sitting in a tent getting rained on all week. Amongst the things I thought about was my fucking awful love life. Iâm in a serious drought, if you know what I mean. Letâs just say the bat is swinging and missing lately. I havenât had a girl in a while, and I need to change this. I think Iâm getting really desperate though. I was contemplating calling up this girl I havenât talked to for nearly three years, after a less than perfect Homecoming at Hawken (I would call my whole Hawken experience âless than desirableâ). It definitely wasnât what I envisioned, but since then Iâve gone through a lot of relationships and nobody has ever come close to making me as happy as she did. I had a great friendship with her and decided to fucking blow it and ask her out. Sometimes some people are just meant to be friends and nothing more, and I think that was the case. But sheâs the one person that I canât forget after all of these relationships (Iâve had a total of 4 girlfriends, none of which really lasted too long). I wouldnât ever say that she was my girlfriend, because I donât think it ever really got to that level. I wish it had, but unfortunately it didnât. Ahhâ¦ teenage problems. Fucking bullshit. Iâm sick of it. Why is the heart so retarded? I can go out with a drop-dead gorgeous girl and it does nothing at all for me if sheâs got a lame personality. I guess thatâs a problem. Anywayâ¦ I doubt Iâll call this girl, after all, itâs long over and sheâs moved on in the three years since then probably. And besides, that might be a bad thing. Right around when she stopped talking to me she appeared to be getting involved more heavily in drugs (I suspected). I knew that she already smoked regularly, and even I did occasionally at the time. That didnât really bother me, though. I guess itâs a lost cause. I donât know why people hang onto shit like this. People are just weird sometimes. The heart is a fucked up thing. Of all of my relationships, the worst of them all is the girl I liked the most. Doesnât that suck? Sometimes life just sucks.  Iâm gonna start recommending certain songs hereâ¦ Trust me, they rockâ¦ If you want any of them, just IM me on AIM and Iâll send them to youâ¦ Today Iâll list a few of my current favorite songs and a little description for each.  Alexisonfire â âSide Walk When She Walksâ --- This band fits into the new hybrid genre of âscreamo,â along with bands such as Brand New, Atreyu, and My Chemical Romance. What sets this band apart is the singerâs vocal range, demonstrated here on this song, my pick for one of the top songs of the summer. If only radio could catch onâ¦  Matt Mays â âCity Of Lakesâ --- Mays is a loner, a Canadian who doesnât give a shit if he reminds you of other singer/songwriters. His lyrics set him apart, and he sure can play the guitar. Heâs been placed in the Rock/Country genre on  urlLink www.maplemusic.com , however, I donât really hear much country in him. How to describe Mays? Heâs kind of a Jet meets Jack Johnson type of thing, though his songs canât be mistaken for either. He transcends genres, and can crank out one hell of a catchy tune, as evidenced on âCity Of Lakes.â On this one, I must emphasize contacting me on AIM if you want this song, because it may be kind of hard to find. However, itâs worth it. Trust me. The riffs on this song will have you tapping your foot in mere seconds, and singing along not long thereafter.  Atreyu â âRight Side Of The Bedâ --- Earlier I classified these guys as âscreamo,â but they really should be considered metal. Atreyu benefit from having multiple members who can belt out vocals, with the so-called lead singer just basically doing a lot of screaming, with other members of the band working the more musical chorus. It makes for a great song, worth a listen for sure.  Stabilo â âEverybodyâ --- Yet another Canadian. I donât know what it is with Canadians, but they sure can crank out a good tune. This one sounds pretty damn simple, with an acoustic guitar and vocals to start. Then the drums come in. Then, eventually, the electric intstruments come in, making the song a keeper. This one isnât loud, but itâs easy to relate to and VERY easy to like. Good song from a GREAT band. Support Canadian music, folks. Itâs worth it.  Zebrahead â âHello Tomorrowâ --- These guys typically sound like your prototypical punk-rap group with little zest at all. However, with âHello Tomorrowâ they come up with a true gem of a song; a well-written, well-played song that might be enough to rocket Zebrahead into the mainstream for good.  Muse â âHysteriaâ --- I wasnât a huge fan of Museâs first single (the name of it escapes me at the moment) so I didnât really pay much attention when their album was released last year. This song, however, has rocketed their album, âAbsolution,â to the top of my most-wanted list. You canât possibly mistake this band for any other, as they are truly unique in every aspect, especially vocally.  Burden Brothers â âShadowâ --- These guys released a single entitled âBeautiful Nightâ that got medium airplay at a few modern rock stations across the country. Mostly it just made it onto a lot of ânew musicâ shows and never really got added to their playlists. These guys rebounded with an outstanding new single that packs an awesome punch. With eerie lyrics and outstanding vocals, this song is HIGHLY recommended.

      Hey, folks. For all you fat guys like me, the Atkins diet works. Let me tell you though, you better have a lot of free time on your hands. Let me explain. See, artificial sweetener has a lot of things in it that your gastrointestinal system doesn't like. So, for example, you have to make EXTREMELY FREQUENT bathroom breaks. And don't bring your newspaper because it won't be a relaxing bathroom stay. A very painful one, instead.
