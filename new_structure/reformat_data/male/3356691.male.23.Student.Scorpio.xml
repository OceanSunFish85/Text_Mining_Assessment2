       The study skills depend on one thing, and that is your willingness to WANT to improve and do well in school. If you really don't want to make the effort and sacrifice, no amount of suggestions, ideas, or outlines can help much. You are the one who is responsible for your education, and effective study skills can help you.

       I was in a restaurant for a birthday party, then suddenly, breezing through the doors from the entrance I saw her. A vision in pink. I said to myself, "Who is this vision? Surely, she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star. Look at her skin. Who does her hair?" In that moment, I knew that someday we'd end up like this, like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza. I said to Lolo, who was supposed to be one of my friends, "Dude, I'm in love. Could this siren love me? Are the gods that kind?" Lolo turned to me, opened his drowsy eyes and said, "Who you think you are? A knight in shining armor, riding a white horse? Why don't you just go to sleep again and stop exclaiming from you god damn dream?"

       Henry the Fifth was talking to his men. He said, "From this day to the ending of the world, we in it shall be remembered. We lucky few, we band of brothers, for he who today sheds his blood with me shall be my brother".

       In the world war II, paratroopers of the 101st Airbourne were totally surrounded by the Germans in Bastogne. They were short of food, equipment, ammunition, and even lacked winter clothing. So two days before the Christmas of that year, which I think is 1944, General Mcauliffe received a letter from the German Commander demanding the 101st's honorable surrender, the only way Germans offered to save the USA encircled troops from total annihilation. Guess what, the German Commander got the following reply, "To the German Commander,  NUTs !" On December 26, General Patton's Third Army broke through the German lines, allowing supplies to flow in and the wounded to be evacuated. But no member of the 101st has ever agreed that the division needed to be rescued.

       Children who watch a lot of television produce less melatonin, new research suggests - the "sleep hormone" has been linked to timing of puberty.  Scientists at the University of Florence in Italy found that when youngsters were deprived of their TV sets, computers and video games, their melatonin production increased by an average 30 per cent.  âGirls are reaching puberty much earlier than in the 1950s. One reason is due to their average increase in weight; but another may be due to reduced levels of melatonin,â suggests Roberto Salti, who led the study. âAnimal studies have shown that low melatonin levels have an important role in promoting an early onset of puberty.â  Salti and colleagues studied 74 children aged between six and 12 years old, who normally watched an average three hours of television in the evening between 2000 and midnight. The youngsters, from the Tuscan town of Cavriglia, were encouraged to watch more TV than usual for a week preceding the study.  From: urlLink Television watching may hasten puberty

       For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.    1. Tolerance  This is often interpreted as "sympathy to scheduling issues during football season," but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like â whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy â and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.    2. Compatibility with friends  His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.    3. Honesty and decency  Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.    4. Independence  This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his "space" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.    5. Comprehension of differences  Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose.

       Most computer companies are saving money by outsourcing the majority of their calls. This is actually not new, for a long time Dell outsourced its calls to local companies that did the hiring and firing and training, the service was actually better than Dell reps alot of times. Then Dell decided to "cut costs" and started outsourcing their calls to India, support has definitly gone down. I really don't have a problem with sending jobs somewhere else, I think it helps the global economy, but if your job is to talk on the phone having a heavy accent is usually not a good idea.  Recently Dell had to pull a large amount of it's support from India because a super large corporate customer was threating to switch because the support was so bad. But don't get confused, if you are not a huge company, chances are your call is going most of the way around the world.

        urlLink Gmail Filter Tips : "I haven't seen anyone cover some of the undocumented filters trick you can do with Gmail. Gmail doesn't even have a 'how to' on filters yet. The reason they don't have a 'how to' is because it's pretty dang simple (oh yea, and its in beta still). You can setup a filter to automatically do actions on an e-mail such as: Skip the Inbox (Archive it), Star it, Apply a label, or Move it to the Trash. These filters can be based upon a combination of: From, To, Subject, Has the words, Doesn't have the words, and Has attachment. I haven't pushed the limited, but from this tricks 'n' tidbits page I see that Gmail currently has a limit of 20 filters. So I offer the follow tip for creating less filters: Use '|' (OR) and '*' (wildcard) characters to catch multiple e-mail addresses and apply a general filter.   Example 1:  Starring and Labeling e-mails from specified buddies of mine. I setup a label called 'Buddies'. Then I go and create a new filter. The 'From' field can contain multiple e-mail addresses, but not a comma delimited list like one might first expect. You need to separate each e-mail address with a '|' (pipe) which means 'OR'.   From: joe.shmoe@hotmail.com|Bob.Dole|geek@foo.com   The above example will catch e-mail from either joe.shmoe@hotmail.com, Bob.Dole@gmail.com (notice in my filter I didn't specify '@gmail.com', this is because you don't need the domain when referencing other Gmail users - same for when composing an e-mail), or geek@foo.com.   Click 'Next Step'...   Then just select the "Star it" option, and select the "Buddies" label. Now all new messages from these three friends will be starred and labeled automatically.   Example 2:  Very similar to example 1 but now using "*" wildcards. This filter catches all e-mail from vendors I frequently make on-line purchases with. Some vendors like Amazon.com will use multiple e-mail addresses when I make a single purchase - one when I first place my order and then another when my items ship.   First I create a filter "On-line Shopping". Then I go and create new filter with the following...   From: *@amazon.com|*@paypal.com|*@ebay.com|*@thinkgeek.com   The above covers a few places that I purchase items from - your list of course will vary, but you get the idea. And depending upon how avid of an eBay seller/buying you are - you may want a separate label.   Personally, I "Star it" and apply the "On-line Shopping" label to this filter as well. Then, when an order arrives and the transaction is complete, I manually unstar and "Archive" the e-mail, and it will always be available by the label search.So, I hope I was able to open a few eyes to the possibilities of using filters. Now... to test Regular Expressions in filters???

        urlLink Wi-Fi finds the way when GPS can't : "In the concrete canyons of city centres, GPS satellite positioning systems often fail because high buildings block the signals they rely on. But an unlikely back-up for GPS is emerging: Wi-Fi.  A Wi-Fi based positioning system developed in the US and the UK works best where GPS fails: in cities and inside cavernous complexes like shopping malls. And because cheap Wi-Fi technology is already appearing on a raft of gadgets like PDAs, cellphones and laptops faster than more expensive GPS receivers are, the developers predict that Wi-Fi could become central to new location-based applications. They say emergency services in particular could find the system an essential back-up. Wi-Fi allows people to connect devices wirelessly to the internet. Base stations are springing up in coffee bars, libraries, universities, airports, phone booths and other public places. Each base station broadcasts a radio signal to announce its presence to devices within a range of around 100 metres. This signal incorporates a unique network address code that identifies the base station. Anthony LaMarca of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues at Intel's research labs in both the US and the UK, have developed software that constantly records the radio signal strengths from nearby base stations.  It can identify the origin of the signal from a database giving the location of 26,000 Wi-Fi base stations in the US and the UK. Using the signal strength from at least three base stations, it can then triangulate the user's location. 'This is a poor man's GPS,' says team member Bill Schilit of Intel Research in Santa Clara, California. "
