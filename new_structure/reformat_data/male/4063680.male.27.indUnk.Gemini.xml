      I still have to think of a title for this tape I'm giving the Mae Shi tonight.  I'm pretty sure no one's reading this, but if you are, please add a comment or something with a suggestion, owe-que?  Anyway, here's the track listing, just cuz I'll forget it:  Side A: Push - the Cure Starbound - Disco Inferno Groovy Train - the Farm I'm Free - the Rolling Stones All the Critics Love U in New York - Prince It's Alright - Pet Shop Boys Why Can't This Be Love - Van Hagar Seventeen Years - Ratatat Kill Your Sons - Lou Reed Kingdom Come - Tom Verlaine V-2 Schneider - David Bowie I Know I'm Not Wrong - Fleetwood Mac  Side B: First Wave Intact - the Secret Machines Christine - the House of Love The Town Halo - A.C. Newman The Saturday Boy - Billy Bragg Mercury Poisoning - Graham Parker Going Left Right - Department S It Can't Come Quickly Enough - Scissor Sisters Driving Along - Harry Nilsson Ghosts of Princes in Towers - Rich Kids Here Come the Warm Jets - Brian Eno  I think I might also give them a tape that has the audio output of the first 45 minutes of  Velvet Goldmine  on one side, and  My Dinner With Andre  on the other.

      So yesterday Pitchfork took on the Mae Shi's   urlLink Terrorbird .       I kinda gagged on the review, so when I emailed Tim about it, he said to write Jamie of  urlLink Lunchboxing.com .  Turns out that site is way cool, and most cool of all, they're running  urlLink reactions  to Pitchfork's lazy hipster pose regarding the Mae Shi album.   So this is what I emailed to Jamie:   Hi Jamie:  I was bitching to Tim Byron about Pitchfork, and he directed me to your site and email.  I mean, yeah, the daily updates make Pitchfork an easy thing to check when I arrive at my day job everymorning, but this review pissed me off.  They'd probably be proud of pissing a reader off, but a bigger problem is that the review seriously undermined their credibility as well.   It was just so lazy and pitchformulaic.  I can understand the XBXRX and Ex Models comparisons (and to a lesser extent, Deerhoof) - the writer was trying to situate the Mae Shi as part of contemporary indie rock.  Fair enough... but 311?  Rage Against the Machine?  Besides the fact that those references are mistifying and irrelevant to the album being reviewed, the writer is well aware that those sort of references will induce snickering in the sort of readership that site gets.   When the writer eschews references to talk about themusic, it got downright hostile:  "That said, when these straightforward songs aren't up to "Power to the Power" snuff, all the guitar gymnastics comes off as talentless bullshit, drenched in noise to mask an inability to play."  I know the review got a 6.5, which is not"disastrous," and the writer pointed out several positive things about the album.  But to dismiss the ability of the band in that statement... it's haughty and curiously spiteful, it's a writer in love with his own rhetoric, and it communicates that the review clearly isn't about music.  In their positive reviews, Pitchfork often tries to position themselves as tastemakers, an alternative media source for (relatively) undiscovered new talent. While this is self-serving, it also allows people to hear about cool new artists they might grow to love. The unfortunate flip-side is that the site has constantly threatened to become a monolithic arbiter of cool, rather than a forum for reviewing music on its own merits. It's too bad, really.  I love this album, but even if somebody didn't, it would be cool to hear them actually try to engage with the music and figure outwhat they didn't like about it.  But then, I suspectthat if the writer let his guard down enough and tried to think about it, he probably would've liked it.  Anyway, cool site, and thanks for letting me air my grievances.  I feel much better now.-Alex.

       I suppose I should first of all mention that this my inaugural post. Seems self-evident, though.      So last night I went to  urlLink the Smell  downtown. Rock show /  urlLink Mae Shi  record release / requiem for the Manifolds. Met up with the lovelies Heidi and Bill Gray - their friends Danny, Frank - lots of other people too. Last summer (seems longer now), I would've said the residue of  urlLink Friendster  was all over everything, but for some reason, that schematic of webs of my friends, and friend's friends, doesn't seem to work. Everyone last night seemed like a free agent, rather than on so-and-so's roster of friends. More atomized, but less scene-y. Everyone should be their own person, after all.       The first "band" that played was Foot Village. Bill prefaced their performance by saying they were a punk rock drum circle. Which I reminded him was still a fucking drum circle. And okay, at times, I was into it - there was a mesmeric groove that emerged sporadically through the clatter. However, given that the saving virtue of the set was its brevity, I'd probably relegate this act to gimmick status.       Heidi became the beer-maiden, accompanying me and others around the corner to get beers to go. I went to the "sports bar." An odd quiet in that place. From my perspective, it's the strangeness of a tall white boy walking into their establishment. But I didn't ask them, so I don't know for sure.      Then the final Manifolds set. Goddamn. Since last year, my respect and love for this band have grown and grown. And now it's over. Curious, though, for the final show to be missing one member. Julian was typically hilarious in his banter. It reminded me of how my dad told me that surgeons crack jokes while they're pulling things that shouldn't be in bodies out of chest cavities, etc. Like assured, accomplished, in complete control of the monster behind him... he professed his love for jam bands like Phish and String Cheese Incident, and responded to quips from the crowd about the missing second drummer with dry authoritarian explanations. Oh, so yeah, the missing second drummer. Previous sets seemed to me to have this awesome militaristic quality. Like the band was inside a tank, orchestrating an onslaught. With only one drummer, everything opened up and became more musical. Still aggressive, but each of the four band members interacted with spontaneity and joy that wasn't as apparent before. The twin-guitar attack of Jeff Byron and Julian -- it was like Jimmy Page twinned himself. Man.       And then abruptly the set finished and the band unset-up rapidly while the crowd continued to applaud. An elegant finale.      Outside, what anyone who wasn't there would term a hipster convention persisted. I don't know, the invisible rules and minute corrections that govern this kind of behavior seems like a way to avoid being superficial. Which is good. But human nature means that things that one does to avoid  being  [blank] are quickly replaced by things which one does to avoid  appearing  [blank].      Tim and I discussed that hippies were back. Psychedelic jam bands,  urlLink animal collectives , drum circles. Since a large part of my job is revisiting the  urlLink lysergic haze  that I hadn't even thought about since  urlLink high school , I'm less than thrilled about this latest retrochurning development. Why can't  urlLink baggy  come back?      Next were  urlLink The Wives . I saw these guys... a while ago,I think, at Koos in Long Beach. And I was awed by their energy and  urlLink engagement with the crowd . This time, well, they started with an endless droney post-rock build-up that never really delivered. And it was so hot, and unfortunately, this show had that one asshole who flings himself all around people with no regard to how invited he should feel about that. So I was close to nub. But when they actually got into it with like songs -- "This one is called 'Wives hate police.' " (shrug) " 'Wives hate police'? Okay." -- yeah, okay, they rock. Visually, too. No gimmicks, just energy. Impressive.      Finally - The Mae Shi. Not one of their best sets. The heat was worse. And the moshing (yeah, for real, smelly greasy grunge man Cee-attel bullshit) was horrible. Jeff had this weird light-up thing on his guitar. There was a TV monitor. But none of things mattered, and in fact, all of them ended up being part of the glow that charged the moment of the show, and those that followed.  urlLink Ezra is such a distinctive vocalist - mad scientist, Old Testament preacher, archetype of alienation, post-adolescent inner child. He used to be defiantly awkward on stage - twisted, mangled in his microphone - and now he looks more assured and sexy. As the voice of the Mae Shi, that makes sense. They're a more mature band now. Where before using an Aerosmith riff in the midst of their spastic artpunk sound-collages seemed like smirking lunacy - now when Jeff lets loose some power chords, standing astride the stage, legs spread, it's Rawk. It all works because the band itself seems like it could dissolve into ones and zeros and twenty-threes at any moment. The set dissolved into chanting, and the band letting loose their instruments into the crowd for audience members to play, and then finally, peace, as Ezra crouched into his keyboard, clutching his microphone, and sang his heart out. Finally, the keyboards flat-lined into oblivion and it was all over.       I can't wait for the show Friday.

      I'm always fascinated by tragic tales of near-stardom:  from  urlLink allmusicguide , a biography of Jobriath.  by Dave Thompson   Widely acclaimed today as the first ever openly (and genuinely) gay rock star, an iconic status which only seems to harden as time passes, Jobriath can also be described among the saddest casualties in modern musical history. The two albums he cut during 1973-1975 are collectors items today and deservedly so. But for at least two decades after their release, their maker's name was more likely to be evoked as an example of the dangers of hype, than anything else, with the actual quality of both his music and his performance deeply buried beneath the avalanche of scorn which knowing critics still pour on his head.  However, both  urlLink Morrissey  and  urlLink the Pet Shop Boys  have talked openly of their admiration for Jobriath,  urlLink Jayne County  has described him as America's premier glam rock idol and  urlLink Mark Stewart  is an unlikely, but equally loyal fan. So, too, are the generation of young glam rock fans who were curious enough to look beyond the record company hype (and the music industry hatred) to investigate the intriguingly packaged, deliciously delivered records which bore the singer's name. Neither has been scarred by time, neither has been overtaken by age. In 1973-1975, Jobriath records were regarded as a waste of time. Today, they are simply timeless. A veteran of the original Los Angeles run of Hair, Jobriath then relocated to New York, where he recorded one album with progressive rock hopefuls  urlLink Pidgeon . The record went nowhere and Jobriath split for a solo career, managed by former  urlLink Jimi Hendrix  associate  urlLink Mike Jefferies . They parted company soon after and Jobriath soldiered on alone, beating his head against what was rapidly becoming a wall of unmitigated hostility towards his music. One of the most popular of the manifold legends surrounding Jobriath is the reaction which a set of his demos drew from Columbia Records president  urlLink Clive Davis  â "mad and unstructured and destructive to melody."   urlLink Davis ' disdain did not fall on stony ground, however. Indeed, Jerry Brandt, at that time manager of  urlLink Carly Simon , was so intrigued by  urlLink Davis ' remarks that he immediately set up a meeting with the singer, then signed him to a management deal. His enthusiasm was contagious as well. Elektra Records head  urlLink Jac Holzman  later confessed, "I made two errors of judgment in my days at [the label] and signing Jobriath was one of them." Equally incriminatingly, Jobriath doesn't receive a single mention in  urlLink Holzman 's official label history, Follow the Sun.  At the time, however, Elektra's belief in Jobriath appeared limitless. The label spent over $80,000 on his eponymous debut album, with almost half of that sum being poured into promotion. At the height of glam rock, Jobriath was being portrayed as the glammiest artist of them all â and when the inevitable comparisons with  urlLink David Bowie  were floated, Brandt knew precisely how to respond. "Jobriath is as different from Bowie as a Lambourghini is from a Model A Ford. They're both cars, it's just a question of taste, style, elegance and beauty." Full page ads in Vogue, Penthouse, and the New York Times forwarded such claims into areas that had never previously been courted by the music industry. A 50-foot square billboard in Times Square saw his visage glowering over New York's daily commuters; posters on the front of London's bus fleet ensured he dominated that city as well. Both Cashbox and Rolling Stone ("Jobriath has talent to burn") gave the album rave reviews, while an appearance on TV's Midnight Special raised the singer's media profile even higher.  Unfortunately, the record simply didn't sell, at home or abroad. Such was the enormity of the hype built around Jobriath, so vast were the promises which his backers were making, that when the album finally hit the streets, there was no way it could live up to its billing â no way, in fact, that any record could. As  urlLink Jac Holzman  later reflected, "the music seemed secondary to everything else. It was... lacking in any sense of reality. It's an embarrassment." A proposed European concert debut at the Paris Opera House was canceled and though Elektra allowed Jobriath to record a second album, they already seemed to have washed their hands of him.  urlLink Creatures of the Street  received little promotion, poor reviews, and near-zero sales. A U.S. tour during spring, 1975, drew little attention (and even less applause) and it was only towards the end of an utterly miserable and apparently drug-crazed venture that Jobriath and his band,  urlLink the Creatures , finally began winning over audiences. Their last ever performance, at Tuscaloosa University, ended with five encores and a near riot.  It was too little, too late.  urlLink Brandt  dropped Jobriath from his roster midway through the outing and immediately the tour was over and Jobriath announced his retirement. He retreated to the glass pyramid he had erected on the roof of the Chelsea Hotel in New York, where he would remain for the rest of his life.  He attempted to break into Hollywood, auditioning for a role alongside  urlLink Al Pacino  in Dog Day Afternoon, but was passed over. Attempts to record a third album never got beyond the demo stage; there was also talk of a presumably autobiographical rock musical, to be titled Pop Star. It, too, never came to fruition, and by the early '80s, Jobriath was working as a singer in a New York cocktail bar. He passed away in July 1983, of AIDS-related illnesses.

      From  urlLink Soxblog :    THE KERRY BRAIN  Somethingâs been bothering me about John Kerry. I just donât think heâs that smart.  One of the axiomatic dynamics of this presidential race has been that Bush is a dolt while Kerry is highly intelligent. But if Kerry is so bright, where has he been hiding his allegedly fearsome intellect? Does âI voted for the $87 billion before I voted against itâ sound like the workings of a brilliant mind? And yet the Adam Nagourneys of the world continue to insist that Kerry is remarkably âcomplexâ with an uncanny sense for nuance. But Iâve come to a conclusion: Heâs not particularly smart.  Letâs take a look at his academic record for illustration. As a control for our study, letâs use another party who for the purposes of this analysis weâll call George W. Bush. As we all know, Ivy League admission back in the 60âs and 70âs was highly political. If you had the right connections, your ticket was all but punched. Thus, Kerry and Bush had no trouble gaining admission to Yale. Both hailed from the same prestigious prep school and had a surfeit of family âpull.â  At Yale, Bush was a famously indifferent student. Once out of Yale, Bush was an even more famously indifferent national guardsman. And yet a few years after emerging from New Haven, Bush gained admission to Harvard Business School, no doubt thanks to family connections and an academic performance that though quite unimpressive suggested that he would be able to handle the work at HBS.  Now the allegedly big-brained Kerry graduated Yale a couple of years before Bush. Kerry, unlike the President, is not a famously dunderheaded student; he was supposed to be blessed with his preternatural sense for nuance in the crib. After graduating Yale, Kerry burnished his resume by being a war hero first and a media star second. So after this impressive performance, where did he go to law school? Boston College.  (None of what follows is intended as a slight towards Boston College or its law school. B.C. is a wonderful institution that has produced many wonderful graduates including Michael Adams and Doug Flutie.)  If youâre not from Boston, you might be unaware of the following truth: No one here, in spite of Boston Collegeâs undeniable strengths, would eschew an invitation to attend Harvard Law School to attend B.C. Itâs simply not done. Thus we can reasonably infer that Kerry did not get in to Harvard Law.  And thatâs remarkable. Given his family connections and his post graduate work both in the war and later protesting it, his admission should have been a given. The only thing that would explain Kerry not getting into Harvard would be that he performed dreadfully at Yale. Indeed, he would have had to perform at a level that would have raised the prospect that he couldnât handle the work at Harvard. His efforts were probably so weak, they could even be described as sub-Bushian.  The reason this matters is because a key subtext for the Kerry campaign is that heâs smarter than the incumbent. The Senator, with his ear for subtlety and his eye for complexity would have seen through intelligence errors that fooled the rest of the world. Or so his campaign would have you believe.  Iâve scrutinized Kerryâs record searching for evidence of his purportedly giant intellect. Iâve found none. His academic biography includes no Latin words like âlaudeâ or âmagna.â Who knows? Maybe Kerryâs just being modest and doesnât want to boast about decades old accomplishments. But I doubt it.  Of course, the Kerry campaign could prove me wrong by releasing transcripts of his time at Yale and Boston College. What about it, Kerry campaign â care to weigh in on this?(Correction: Bush and Kerry did not go to the same prep school. One went to St. Paul, the other to Andover. I can't keep straight who went to which - sorry.)      It's always good to take apart assumptions, but I had to add a wrinkle, so I wrote soxblog the following email:   Interesting unpeeling of something that's generally assumed about the two candidates.  Lest we forget, though, Bush being dumb did him no harm in the 2000 campaign.  His inability to cogitate actually worked in that genial, Reagan-esque way of deflecting any serious analysis of what he stood for. Which is why that "Compassionate Conversative" and "Uniter, Not Divider" bullshit mostly went unchallenged.  One other thing: a comparison of Harvard Business School and Boston College Law School isn't entirelyvalid.  Law School is, in general, a more rigorous experience than Business School, even at the most prestigious universities.  I'm substantiating my claim anecdotally from my friends, but the meta-evidence is that this fact is also widely known.    Anyway, well-done post.  I came to it from  urlLink slate .  Cheers,  Alex

      Joking.  I hate that term.  Funny, though, how people don't ever bother with "This Band Will Change Your Life" or "This Band Will Change the World" anymore.  Hype is fatigued and losing its ambition.  Maybe it's smoking pot.   urlLink And but so , I had lots of reasons to resist liking the Secret Machines:  1.  They're on a major label.  I know, I know.  It seems like a silly objection these days.  What's indie?  What's a major label?  Actually, the distinction is crystal fucking clear.  Sony just merged with BMG, so now there's four major music groups of labels.  Those are majors.  Everything else is an indie.  Whether it's  urlLink Sub Pop  or  urlLink Retard Disco .  I'm not saying that good music can't come from major labels... but there's an aura around this band that's diminished by it not being on an indie label.  Invoking Walter Benjamin here doesn't seem out of line.   2.  They're from Texas.  Like Our President.  This may be unfair, but America is a big country, and  urlLink regional biases can be very helpful .  3.  They moved to New York.  Fucking hipsters.  4.  I just saw them on MTV, playing in a darker version of what look like the studio for TRL.  Ugh.   Despite all that, their first album is very promising.  Aw hell, it's exciting.  For starters, it's ambitious as hell.  The first track is a nine minute epic that moves with the efficiency of a Phil Spector single.  And elements from that song reappear at the end of the album.  It's an easy trick to make something seem bigger than it is, but it works here.   Mostly because their sound is already pretty huge:  Martial drums that attack in formation.  Keyboards that arpeggiate beautifully but also blare like depressed sirens. Guitars that stab the sky without losing the plot.  Most critics have pointed out that these guys sound like a punk-y Pink Floyd (or, uh, the Flaming Lips) but to me one thing they really do have is their own sound.  I just wish the music was enough.

      It's almost too easy to be a frothing-at-the-mouth liberal these days.  Look at the press coverage.  From Salon:  But if you think the press rushed in to follow-up the Journal's report about Berger being cleared by the 9/11 commission, guess again; the press' subsequent silence has been deafening. "Ever since they invented ink and paper, charges have got more space than the truth," says Joe Lockhart, the former Clinton press secretary who has been acting as Berger's spokesman. "Am I disappointed more people haven't picked this up? Yes. Am I surprised? Absolutely not." Not one major newspaper, including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, or Washington Post, has reported on the Journal's 9/11 commission findings. And in the four days since the Journal report, CNN has aired just 6 very brief mentions of the development. None of CNN's reports lasted more than 60 seconds, and none involved CNN interviewing experts to get their take on the news. Stitched together the six mentions totaled maybe four minutes of TV time. Compare that to two weeks ago when the Berger story was first leaked and CNN aired more than 40 in-depth segments, covering hours and hours of airtime. Then again, CNN's six mentions is five more than the NBC/MSNBC/CNBC news team has managed to date. That, compared to the 22 Berger segments it ran. Fox News has not reported the Journal's finding, despite the fact it ran more than a dozen Berger stories/segments two weeks ago.

      1. Wes Anderson has become the Quentin Tarantino of this still-young decade.  Or at least this summer.  Everyoneâs got an indie soundtrack, a muted color palette, and depressed young people these days.   1a.  Fortunately, âGarden Stateâ is a much less obvious and much less spiteful variation on the Wes than âNapoleon Dynamite.â  Perhaps as one should expect from a writer-director-star, Zach Braff is a much more emotionally invested storyteller and storybeing.  1b.  Itâs curious that Wes Anderson should become a template.  His films seem so handmade and, well, singular.  Iâd go on, but I donât want to betray the list of this list.  2.  Peter Sarsgaard is my new favorite actor.  Playing a yuppie editor with morals in last yearâs âShattered Glassâ was when I first really noticed this guy.  In âGarden State,â he plays the definitive intelligent rogue.  Yes, heâs still living at home at 26.  He keeps perpetrating these stupid schemes to make money.  He drinks, smokes pot and aggressively slouches.  But Sarsgaardâs nuanced performance enables this character to notice the limitations of his life, recognize that he should move beyond them, and decide that itâs not really worth it.   3.  That specific character and performance perfectly hit what the film was clearly trying to do the entire time.  To Make a Statement through its mid-20s protagonists about its generation.  Did it work?  Wellâ¦ Making a Statement is an ambitious act, but this film proposed that a lack of ambition is one of the defining characteristics of This Generation.  Fair enough, but the result was that the medium and the message were at cross-purposes.  The result: lots of wonderful little snapshots of recognizably authentic contemporary behavior, followed by embarrassing âcatharticâ moments that you can find on âOprahâ or âDr. Philâ any day of the week.  4.  Iâm sure someone has commented on the proliferation of both Prozac and Ecstasy, and the correspondence of each pillâs effects on its users.  And Iâm sure someone has also brought up Brave New World in such a discussion.  But seeing it dramatized on the big screen was new for me.  Playing it for a joke with characters talking about that book by âAldous Huxtableâ (sic) undercut the filmmakerâs ambition.   5.  But then again, Zach Braff is also a sit-com actor.  I like sit-com actors:  John Larroquette, Tony Shalhoub (yeah, OK, âMonkâ is a one-hour, but câmon), Steven Weber, Tim Dalyâ¦ maybe I just really like âWings.â  Ooh, David Hyde Pierce too.  Heâs great.  6.  Natalie Portman was doing that quirky hyperactive bohemian thing that Kate Winslett did in âEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.â  Huh, this must be some new actress trend.  Thatâs really awful.  Stop it.  7.  Lawrence Sher, the d.p., deserves a lot of credit for this movie.  It takes a lot of courage to just go with a muted color palette.  It could turn out just boring, but if you have a lot of confidence with your shot composition, wellâ¦ you can almost be as nifty as  urlLink Robert Yeoman .  Yay for you.  1c.  I think Iâm going to watch âThe Royal Tenenbaumsâ again this week.
