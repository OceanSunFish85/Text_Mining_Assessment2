      Hello how are you? Bring it to dinner, anything you want. Whatever you feel like talking about. Personally, I feel like bringing the masses in here and finally getting a tap on the voice of all you jokers. You've got to have an opinion on something, anything, LET'S HEAR IT!!!!!!! Whatever makes you happy, sad, knifeslashingthroatcuttinglyrepulssed, bring it on brother!!!! Like how 'bout them gas prices??? We have hundreds of thousands of troops over in the middle east the flipping Mecca of the oilworld and I'm still paying$2 a freakin' gallon! I understand the fact that we have to control the production of gas andthe comparison between rising steel prices and possible gas prices and China and India mating like crazy (yes, I said mating ) eating up all the resources,I'm all for itman I really am. I Dig it. BUT LET'S GET A MOVE ON THERE BUDDY!!!!! The elections in November, time to pull up them boot straps and take control of the situation, pard. Forget the United Nations, forget the sissy French (they're still pissed about their oil refinery), and start thinking about us. You know whoI'm voting for? The guy who promises .99 a gallon for premium. That's where my hanging chad is going. Hey people it's been real, thanks for coming, I'll be here all week.  - Cabre
