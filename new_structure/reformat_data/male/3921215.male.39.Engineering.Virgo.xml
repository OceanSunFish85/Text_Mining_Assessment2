						   It's tough being a Christian liberal in Oklahoma. When I tell a fellow Christian that I vote Democrat, they look at me like I am a turd in a punch bowl, Satan incarnate, or another reality TV show. They look at me like I am some fetus-hater or flag-burner or like somebody dare think that Kenneth Starr did 1000 times more to hurt this country and 1/1000 as much to help itthan Bill Clinton. Well, 1/3 guilty. I've taken my hit-and-run shots like "Democrats support anti-Christianlegislation"... (insert the first half syllable of my retort here), then... "oh, I don't want to talk politics". And I've reacted with my fair share of hatered and venom, I confess. (See theaddress of my blog page for crying out loud.) And I really don't hate anybody, not even Georgie. But when I ask someone who likes Bush what he's done, they say it's just good to finally have a moral man in the White House. Great. Let's send a couple hundred grand a year salaryto every man in Promise-Keepers and let them all have the Oval Office. That would be fifty-thousand times better, wouldn't it? And still cheaper than the war on Iraq...   First, I am going to try to stay on the high road here. No (more) cheap shots on the GOP unless it's really funny, I promise. But I am going to explain to you (fully expecting that you are capable of understanding, my intelligent religious-right brethren and sistren) (tip the hat to W. on the made-up word) how a man with the same Savior as you could vote left.   I am for the separation of Church and state. I capitalize Church, the body of Christ, and not state, a body of men. I am for it in every instance.For example,no Nativity scenes orcrossesat places supported by tax funds. I love Jesus; but Jews, Muslims, atheists and a people of a zillion other isms pay taxes. I don't want to payfor a Wheel of Enlightenment or a Star of David or a cross upside-down shaped like a question mark or a Buddha or anything like that. And it does not advance my belief to force the symbols of my beliefs on their sensibilities (or lack thereof, in cases). And I believe that all non-Christians should become Christians, but that's our job as Christians and as the Church. And itis  our  freedom of speech that is protected, to speak our minds anywhere we peacefully can, and display our symbols proudly, at our Churches, on our properties and on our persons. And the biggest pinko liberal commie (I) wouldn't stand in your or anyone'sway of doing any of that.   Just as badly as I do not want Judaism, Mormon, Buddhism or any other religion taught to my son as equally valid alternatives for to his current belief, I don'twant even the most trusted public school teacher trying to explain Christianity tomy son.That's MY job, with the help of well-chosen teachers in mychurch familyI don't intend to shelter myson from other beliefs, and I intend to raise him as a free-thinker who is true to himself, and to be a Christian example to him, so that if (WHEN, I pray)he accepts Jesus Christ in his maturity it will befrom his heart and of his own will, and glorious(!), not a formality or another (yawn) ceremony. And if you wantto protect your child from any belief, including Christianity, public school should NOT be a place you need to avoid. (This is off the track, but Darwinism is a scientific theory with enoughmerit to make it worthy of scientific study, NOT a religion. If you find it offensive, tell your child that scientists used leaches as medical treatment in Darwins day, and that some science is false, and that the scientific method is by its own definition cyclical and neverending and never claims to arrive at any truths, only eventually eliminate the disproven. Also that Darwin was a Christian, and had his theory published only after his intellectual peers convinced him that his theory would not harm Bible-based belief systems.) Teach your child to befriend non-believers, and to be an example. Teach them to talk about Jesus whereveranyone will listen. Teach your child that school prayer is NOT illegal, that he may pray as openly and freely as he wish. Teach your child that it is wrong to force our beliefs on others, but that it is our job to always be examples and to persuade when we can.   Our government should NOT govern using the New Testament. (What!!??!!! Yep, you heard right.) Nor the Old Testament, the Koran, the Book of Mormon. If you think you want a Church run state, please name an example of a peaceful, graceful, non-opressiveone in the past. And if you think that democracy will guide your Church-run state to peacefulness and prevent it from being opressive, please remember that the winds of politics shift often, and that eventually the majority will be offensive to you. Yes, we are a mainly Christian nation, and yes, our founding fathers were Christians. But our founding fathers  fled  a Church-run state. They had the wisdom to not make a different Church-run state. They decided, that we, as individuals, families,and sects could believe whatever or whomever wechose, wherever or however we wanted, and that no one should feel that it is proper, nor should it be allowed, to prevent anyone else from doing the same. And if we as Christians want to convert someone toChristianity, it is OUR job, not the government's. It is not the government's nor any man's job to enforce the law of God, it is God's. It seems to have worked so far, and by definition you will always have the right to believe the Absolute Truth, you will always have the right to do your duty as a Christian, and you will always have a mission field instead of a battlefield, right in your own neighborhood.   The Republican party has done a brilliant job of convincing you that you must be a Republican if you are to be a Christian. Most of the people who sell that to you don't believe it themselves. It's an anything-for-a-vote world, and I don't claim that Democrats historically have takenmuch higherground, except that we won't try to tell you that Jesus Christ was and is a registeredDemocrat who votes straight ticket every time the polls open. So puh-leeeeez, be a Republican if you wish, and disagree with me if you want to be wrong, but don't tell me that you're any closer to Jesus because of your particular beliefs on how mortal, feet-of-clay man should run a government, unless you really want to explain that when it comes time for us to reckon with the Lord.

						   If you loaned all your old Firesign Records to somebody who never returned them (Mark you dopehead scoundrel) or if your old records (or phonograph) are finally just worn out, you need to know this. Laugh.com has reprinted them. "How can you be in two places at once when you're really nowhere at all" and "Don't crush that dwarf, hand me the pliers" are my favorites. To the best of my knowledge they have them all. I was only hepped to this recently. I have suffered needlessly for years.  And here's a bonus for you... the  real  fab four are recording again, and they're as sharp as ever. "Give me immortality or give me death" focuses on the end of the world/turn of the millenium and the world's ludicrously overzealous love for Di. If you don't know Firesign Theatre, and your interest may be piqued;they have the pace of a young Robin Williams (x4 of course), the timing of a young Steve Martin, the dramatic narrative of early nineties Garrison Kiellor, the unpreachy disgust for whatever of Dennis Miller (without the conservative politics), more characters than Laugh-In with the added bonus of some quirky non-sequiter and puns that you are not ashamed to laugh at. I've been recently crushed and I am depressed as hell. Too personal for here. (See "patriarch" if you must) I wanted to share this with whomever may stumble across it, and resolve to lock myself in a room and listen to every F.T. disc I have (you didn't think "turn on the gas", did you?) Georgie Tirebiter for president!

						   To my beloved aunt, my late father, and my late grandfather; I love you and want to be like you in more ways than you'll ever imagine.  To my late grandmother and her living sons; I dont need your superficial, token affection, nor your lip service. Nor do I want to be your orphaned nephew-bastard.  I declare myself the living patriarch of my own bloodline. I keep my name in memory of the deceased Charlies, and out of convenience. It's a sad irony to share that name with you. S is for the shameless self-promotion T is they talk behind your back U is for under the table dealings B is for a bitter bitch attack B is better off and best without you S is for selfishness and smack  I wonder can you decrypt the message  When your morals and your brains are out of whack?

						   George W. Bush has spent more in one term than any other president has.  It sounds obscene, as our nation is still gasping at the astronomical deficit in the wake of the Reagan years (keep your rose-colored glasses on...  I'll roast that astrologist-consulting arms-trader-for-hostages, budgetless, forgetful, but very charming old fart some other day).  But maybe it's as it should be, after all the dollar is worth less as time marches on.  But $120,000,000,000 of appropriated funds spent on "Operation Enduring Freedom" plus $2,000,000,000 into the additional $67,000,000,000 he hasn't even been granted yet.  I'm no isolationist, and relative to people who routinely read other people's blogs, I may be a simpleton, but is Iraq free as we speak (the war is over but the allied casualties and our deficit are still rising)?  I've heard plausible arguments that it is better, but that is at best subjective, at worst ludicrous, and absolutely positively temporary.  If anyone thinks that Al-Qaida is going to shut down because Lunatic # 1 is shut down, does he also believe that the US would shut down if some foreign power imprisoned our president?  No, they're licking their wounds, brainwashing new soldiers that America is Satan, which we make easy by standing around with M-60s with 55,000 of their countrymen having met untimely deaths.  And if you insist that Sadam's regime being ended is a glorious improvement of the world's state, please recall that the man who masterminded slaughtering us on our own soil is alive and well and rich and powerful and maybe feeling a little neglected (and hates Sadam also, because Sadam doesn't hate Americans bad enough.)  And Muslims who hate us are organizing and gaining momentum, and we make it easier for them to hate us. It's fine for them to hate me.  Iraq's able-bodied men have largely been soldiers since they were plucked from what should have been their school days to learn how to kill.  The literate population is largely women, powerless.  The brainwashing is easy with people who cannot read, after all, killin' is fun (ain't it W).  Truth is, we have lost the battle to terrorism, and we always will, because we refuse to be terrorists.  We can crush them with our might and our wealth and our willingness to be even more bankrupt than we are... but they are willing to live in holes, accept defeat, surrender, hate us more, even DIE and reorganize with their wealth from oil.  Oh, if One-Term Sr. would have told W what he done figgered out!  We should be proud of our reluctance to kill civilians to advance our cause, keep our guard up on our own soil (cavity searches at the airport are a bit excessive), travel judiciously, and live with the risks.  Occasionally we need to keep an evil dictator in line and extend some humanitarian gesture, on the scale of the Kosovo invasion, which was effective for a mere couple billion dollars. Bush gave a rational, impassioned and effective speech to the UN as to why the world needed to restrain the mad Huessein.  I listened to the whole thing on NPR and I was impressed.  (No tongue in cheek.)  I felt that multi-national (not unanimous) financial and military support was ours but for a little patience.  A more sober approach, with a sensible budget was assured.  The radical Muslims's hate for the US could be partially absorbed by more significant allies than hapless England.  Still nothing would have improved in the long run, but my son and grandson and great grandson and their generations would have been a hundred-odd billion less in the red.  But Bush's spurs jangled, and he exercised the "clear and present danger" clause in international law and declared war unilaterally.  He said "weapons of mass destruction" and "post 9/11" about a million times, with that steely-eyed, I'm-serious, nobody's-home glint in his eye, and you all bought it.  Okay, I bought it, too, until he asked for $60,000,000,000.  Holy crap!  And on top of that, after no WMDs were being found, and everyone realized that Osama bin Laden was whose blood we wanted, our premise for war (presto-change-o) shifted to a humanitarian effort, oh, and we need $60,000,000,000 MORE for the blessed innocent souls in Iraq.  A post 9/11 $120,000,000,000 humanitarian gesture of futility.  Started by lying as to the premise.  We cannot afford to let this Yalie coke-snorter turned Texas hillbilly  run our country anymore.  Say what you want about Clinton, and he deserves a lot of his so awful it's almost comical reputation, and I voted for him and I'm a little embarrassed... but I think I'd vote for somebody capable of shooting porn flicks (for crying out loud) in the Oval Office, if he would spend money judiciously, inspire confidence in corporate and industrial America, and guide us to unprecidented prosperity.  That's what a president does. The polls are pretty sophisticated now days, hopefully not as sophisticated as they pretend to be.  I saw an outlandish projection that Bush lose the popular vote again and be relected.  Chilling and plausible.  Please, those of you who live in states where Bush or Kerry could win:  GET MAD AS HELL AND DON'T TAKE IT ANY MORE!!!!  I live in Oklahoma and we're a lost cause.  I will do my part, because I acknowledge the concept of noble failure.  I also acknowledge that my countrymen in other states will determine the  outcome of our country.  Pray reason reigns elsewhere.
