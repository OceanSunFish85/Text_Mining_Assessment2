          The   Landmark Education   courses I have, and continue to participate in, have provided me rich opportunities for growth and embracing the fullness of life.      All human beings seem to deal with a sense of resignation, and cynicism about anything really being possible in life. I deal with this on a daily basis. As I develop personally, I seem to be dealing with larger and larger issues in life. Faced with the enormity of some issues that seem out of my control, the first emotional place I visit is resignation, then cynicism (I call this R  C). A good example is my work.      I work at a corporation that delivers residential and commercial telecommunications products and services. The company has a mission for serving itâs customers that I found compelling and exciting when I was interviewing to work there. It took about 24 hours for me to see that this company is far from operating in harmony with itâs own standards. In the past, I would have given in to the human temptation and pull towards R  C. Resignation is in the form of thoughts like "I knew this was too good to be true"â¦Sound familiar? These thoughts are closely followed by "Nothing can make a difference", and "Right, these people are going to transform customer intimacy in the outside world? They canât even meet the needs of their employees inside. Itâll never happen, I might as well bail out while I can." Can you hear the R  C?      Itâs not that Iâm wrong. I have the agreement of every salesperson in this company. One of the greatest gifts Iâve received from Landmark is the ability to recognize the phenomenon of righteousness â LECâs jargon for this is "being right". This is not a personal phenomenon, it pretty much seems to cross all cultural barriers as the single-most important thing to us humans â being right. Almost everyone is right at work. The salespeople are right. We know itâs the fault of management. Managers are right, itâs the fault of a sales force that doesnât bring in enough sales. Everyone knows itâs really the engineerâs fault, because they canât install what we sell. So why should we continue selling?! The company is so divided, itâs hard to imagine this could go on much longer.      Normally, I would be pulled into this tug of war, and have little perspective of the bigger picture â and believe me, I think this way much of the time. Itâs really the ongoing coaching in dealing with tough, real-life situations like this that gives me the focus to go beyond surviving the "situation" at work. As a result of years of this coaching, I have had the courage to approach the CEO and VP of our company, and open a dialogue about addressing the paradigm we live in as a company. As a result, we are exploring the possibility of bringing in corporate coaches to work with management initially, then potentially the whole company. Whether or not that ever happens doesnât really matter to me. The important thing to me is that Iâm playing, engaged in the process of making a difference, rather than sitting on the sidelines, waiting for someone else to fix it.      Through examination, like in my marriage, Iâve been able to see how being right destroys the very relationship I got married for. My wife and I were having an intense argument the other night. It was so disturbing to me that I stormed off and went to sleep in the guest room. In the past, these feelings of anger would have lasted a good long while â maybe 2 weeks to six months â because they would remain unresolved. However, as a result of the powerful coaching we receive, we were able to turn this incident into a breakthrough for both of us.      About halfway through the night, I came back into the bedroom, and snuggled into bed with my wife. The next day, she asked me what gave me the ability to give up the anger and some to bed. I then shared with her the source of my upset feelings. Instead of being defensive, I was able to be vulnerable about how I feel invisible when she doesnât seem to consider me in various situations. I shared that I often feel alone in our relationship, which is the opposite of what I got married for. The insight I had was that it really wasnât her fault. She was being herself. When I withdrew, instead of sharing, there was no potential for both of us to be happy. When I shared, I found she was very open to modifying her behavior, because she is also committed to a loving, sharing relationship. Because we can now communicate like this, being right is less and less important. Having the experience of love and partnership is more and more important, and we can now access this anytime, even under very stressful circumstances.      I have spent many years practicing and studying these principles, and the payoff is that this sense of possibility and "joui de vivre" is throughout my life. Together, my wife and I are designing our lives. That used to sound very anal to me, and inauthentic. I now see that I have two choices in life â take the life that was given to me at birth (being right, surviving and fixing whatâs wrong in life, blaming others, justifying myself, etc) or I can design a new game in life. I can now see a different potential to life. Through the new filters, I interpret that I am the vessel to express creativity that was given to me as my heritage. Now, I see the world is my living room, people are my partners (underneath the barriers they have to experiencing that). I like that interpretation better. Knowing itâs an interpretation, though, gives me the ability to be empowered by it, and not be right about it. Itâs not right or wrong, itâs just a perspective. This also frees me to be aware of reality â others do not necessarily interpret life this way. If I were to expect others to feel the way I do, I could get into a lot of trouble. Walking down the streets of New York, I can view others as my partners, but I better look out for partners whoâd like to pick my pockets or mug me (I didnât say Iâd become stupid!). I more alert AND more happy and at peace with myself and others. If I never got anything else out of Landmark, that would more than suffice.       Rodger C     .      I took the Landmark Forum in 1996. At that time, I was 49 years old, had been married for 27 years, and my two daughters were 13 and 5 years old. I was completely preoccupied with my work. I was a doctor who took care of people who had had an illness or injury affecting the brain; my work included evaluating the particular ways in which the illness or injury had affected the person's abilities â disorders of attention, language, memory, and such. Designing rehabilitation plans to address their difficulties, and monitoring and guiding the ongoing rehabilitation work. Over the years, I had let my friendships slip away, and over the past about five years, it had become my habit to work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. I had gradually become less and less involved with my wife and daughters, and by the time I took the Landmark Forum, I had almost completely withdrawn even from those relationships.       I had thought of my work as a calling, but over time, as I had become more completely preoccupied with it, it had come to seem more like a great burden. And, there were parts of it, especially writing up the evaluations and rehabilitation plans, with which I had always struggled. A colleague at the hospital at which I was then working had, in an extraordinary generosity, taken on helping me develop a more effective approach to getting my writing done. She had herself taken the Landmark Forum and saw that there might be something of value to me in my taking it. Over the course of about six months, we had coffee and a bit of conversation from time to time, and she talked with me about what might be available to me in taking the Forum.       In the end, trusting her, I decided to take the course. The Forum takes place over the course of 3 consecutive full days â Friday through Sunday â and the following Tuesday evening. One of the conversations that takes place during the Forum is about making people wrong â blaming other people, or blaming yourself â when something seems to be going wrong in your life, how we fall into making people others or ourselves wrong, and the cost of doing so. Listening to this conversation, listening to what the Landmark Forum Leader and others saw and shared from their own lives, I came to realize that I had been blaming my wife for years and years for whatever didn't work in my life, and â in blaming her â had been gradually withdrawing from her, and everyone else, into my work. It was a shattering realization.       I also saw, out of the work that was going on in the Forum, that what there was to do was simply to call my wife, and tell her what I had discovered, and apologize. I did that. And in that single conversation with her, I transformed our relationship. Out of that conversation, I got back my relationship with a woman I had loved for almost 30 years, and got back my relationships with my daughters â whom I treasured above everything in life and from whom I had estranged myself. And, as I went on tobuild an entirely different life, with my family at the center, my work â the care of my patients â stopped being a burden and became again a vital calling.       Roger C.

       urlLink Loney's Show Notes : "Michael Frayn's 'Copenhagen'ï¿½ Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle on Stage!  Some Cultural Moralists object to spending tax-monies to subsidize Royal Shakespeare or National Theatre productions which later move to the West End. Some insist this is using the public purse to enrich the commercial theatre.  They argue that Britain's subsidized institutional theatres are in danger of becoming tryout houses for the West End. This controversy has been going on for decades now, but it is specious.  In the case of most transfersï¿½the best of which often reach Broadway as wellï¿½the plays would never have been considered by commercial producers. Both new scripts and difficult or forgotten classics have been brought to life for a much wider audience than those of the NT, RSC, and Royal Court.  The splendid, thought-provoking National Theatre production of Michael Frayn's 'Copenhagen,' now at the lovely Duchess Theatre, is a case in point.  Who would have thought that a play based on the relationship between theoretical physicists Werner Heisenberg and his mentor, Niels Bohr, could have a commercial run?  In fact, excellent as the performances are, handsome as the production is, this seems an unlikely candidate for a Broadway transfer. But it would certainly be interesting to see if it can find an audience in New York.  Heisenberg is knownï¿½if indeed he is known at all to the wider publicï¿½as the discoverer of the Uncertainty Principle. But to scientists and historians, he is also the brilliant mind who was helping the Nazis develop nuclear fission for wartime applications.  Bohr, on the other hand, was a Danish Jewï¿½and a father-figure for Heisenberg, his student and colleague. And he escaped the Nazi purge of Jews in Copenhagen at the last minute, to help the Allies with"
