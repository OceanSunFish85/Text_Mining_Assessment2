						   Complacency, here is what I am feeling. I have been single for a little while now, and almost happy about it. I enjoyed the life of un-attachment; I reveled in the illusion of total control over my little life. As I was walking home from the library tonight, a little in a daze and my mind full of acetal anhydride and other silly chemicals dancing around my brain. I came upon a realization, a grain of truth if you will. I was playing back past relationships in my head, I realized that part of what I enjoyed about the relationship was the chase, the hunt, and the all out pursuit. It was a challenge, it did not matter how much they did or did not want my affections. Once the challenge was over I felt almost a let down from it. I guess that is a lot like the âsearch for the golden hared womanâ out of Wild at Heart, you see someone across the room, you pursue until you find that she is not quite the perfect beauty you thought she was, than on to the next.   I do not like the idea of comparing myself to that kind of attitude or actions. It seems so negative and just downright mean. Sometimes the truth hurts. What I was feeling was a little different in that the change was not in her but in me. Once the relationship was well established, she no longer demanded the effort, so I no longer gave it.  As soon as this thought process, processed, an answer came to me. In the âperfectâ relationship, I would never want to stop trying, or perhaps she would never let me get away with less than 100%.  The question that I want to ask is âwhy divorceâ, or sometimes âwhy not divorceâ? Have you looked around the Christian bookstore lately? There is no shortage of books that tell you how to get the right person for example âHow to avoid Mr. Wrongâ or the ever popular âHow to find Mr. Rightâ. I think that these two are about my favorite. How much do these people actually know, how much of this junk is for me and how much is not. There has to be something going on, books get published just to contradict the last book of a different author. This is almost like school were big-brained people publish papers and other big-brained people read the paper with the intention of going out and disproving them. All this has left me a little confused, puzzled and even perplexed about who to believe and who to disregard.  All this point specific advice and still Christian divorce rates are about the same as the national average. Are we just not reading what we should, are they not telling us what we need to hear. Perhaps something entirely different, look at the attitude of most Americans, there is a level of complacency, laziness, and dispassion that is unsurpassed in history. From needing escalators to move us up and down stairs, to needing motorized wheel chairs for people who are to fat to walk. Lets face it we are just as lazy as we can be in our daily lives. We are thinking  Complacency = A feeling of contentment or self-satisfaction, especially when coupled with an unawareness of danger, trouble, or controversy. Not too many people go into marriage with the idea of breaking it up after a couple years of effort. Perhaps people enter this idea of marriage being passionate about the other person, soon the realization that the other person is just that, a person sinks in and the newness wares off. Than it is back to the lazy old self of not caring, not loving, not helping the other person, and all you are left with are two people who have to live together, and hate every second of it.  So I guess that I am worried about my history and pattern of complacency, and where that might lead me in my life. On the positive side, realizing the problem is the first step in the solution.    -âBe on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be men of courage, be strong. Do everything in loveâ 1cor16:13 (Gena)

						    So I am the master of the tangent, I have known this for a while but never really thought anything of it. Today I stumbled across something that I feel is note worthy so I need to share it. In a lot of settings I have always been a little out there, no not there, out there. For example in my bible studies this year, our fearless leader would come to the study with great ideas about where he wanted to go and what he wanted to teach. He would always have the hardest time because every five minuets someone would say something and I would be off like a rocket in a random direction. I really did not mind that much, but it annoyed the leader a little.   This brings me to something else I wanted to talk about. My whole life I have been the P.K. a preacherâs kid so honestly it was never OK for me to question things or beliefs held by the church, I was the good kid remember. So I always just sat there and nodded in agreement, but inside I was fighting the urge to jump up and say âbut snakes cannot talk they donât have the tongueâ. Or if I did, man, the tongue-lashing would start. Have you ever noticed that, how if you question any part of what a church believes the immediate response is anger and hostility? Why is that? Why if we are holding the truth of the ages, the rock and the foundation of the universe do we get so defensive if it is questioned? The beauty of truth is that it does not need you or I to defend it, it simply is the truth and that is enough. The sad part is that growth comes from questioning. So when we stifle questioning we stifle growth and all we are left with are short silent people.   So where do these random tangents come from? Something that I discovered today is that I feel like my questions and tangents are coming out of a search, and that search is for my heart. Again the ever so long process of owning my religion instead of just living the life put in front of me. I have to ask the questions, I have to challenge the established thought, and I have to dig, dig until it hurts. I have to learn to follow where my heart is leading. âThe glory of God is man fully aliveâ (Saint Irenaeous). The question here is what is a man that is fully alive? Is it a man that sulks in the back pew angry and disgruntled because the drum set is too loud? Is it the man who is convinced he will find God at the bottom of a bottle? Is it someone who thinks they will find fulfillment in the physical intimacy of a lover? Is it the person who hides behind work or school? Or is it someone who takes just the slightest second to listen to where his heart wants to go, and take that first step of faith along an uncertain path?   How scary, to live from your heart, when every input out there is telling you that your heart is evil, to not trust your heart to use your brain, think things through logically. I ask you this question, is your brain any more trustworthy than your heart? The big question, perhaps the only question is what does God want with me? I know a lot of Christians, good people, I am fairly certain that if God were to come down and say to them âTake the red pillâ or âchoose door number 2â they would. So why are so many of us asking what we should do, somewhere along the line we are losing that signal. I know that God has most excellent plans for my friends and I, I know that we are willing to follow. Stay with me here, what I am thinking is; that we have a full proof blueprint ready at hand. It is chiseled into each and every one of our hearts. All we have to do is filter out the noise that is so prevalent in our daily walk. I know, sounds simple but not so easy to execute. Here is a brain twister, live just a little, follow that random thought, question everything, think it through without trying to put it into a box before you start. Above all do not be afraid to look the fool, there is amazing freedom in chasing after your heart. Yes I do look foolish, scattered, and random, but the justification is in holding on to that little grain of truth pondering it, living it. Perhaps in stretching outside of our box just a little, following that little desire or thought we move ever so slightly in the direction we need to. God does not always need to tell us what to do with our life, he already has, and we just need to know where to look.  Caution here I can see this easily being a point of attack and defeat. Desire, so important and yet so dangerous at the same time. Our desire is so easily mislead so how do we keep to the true desire and how to filter out unchrist-like desire? I guess that this is where you have to truly trust your friends. Confide in them, speak the desire you are feeling and pray over each and every one. I personally know that sometimes I have a very poor judgment about some desires, but I have amazing friends who check me and if need be slap me upside the face and ask, âwhat are you thinking!!â  Well here is fragment of a glimpse into the mind-o-matt, chew it over and let me know what you think.

						   So last night Liz and I went to my friend Kimskiâs house to hang out with her and her coz from Chicago.  So we sat around eating pizza, sour patch kids, and peanut butter brownies.  I was a little dismayed by the behavior of some of the people there.  Everyone was a âChristianâ except the coz Rena.  Friday night Rena Liz, and I went out to dinner, than ice skating.  I thought it was great, we had an awesome time of fun food, and I felt like at the end of the night, we were friends.              Saturday night was the pizza feed, everyone was sitting around the living room munching on the pizza and having fun.  I do not think that anyone was trying to but the group came across as âChristianâ and it was not in a fun and pleasant way.  Rena said something like oh crap, and than felt bad and had to check to see if that was OK for her to say, as if by saying crap she might offend some of these âChristiansâ.  I just felt like that was so sad, that people have to change the way they act around Christians.  To an extent I can understand and applaud the effort if you can bring around change in someone elseâs attitude through witnessing to them through your actions, but why should we as Christians shame people into a place where they feel convicted by anything that comes out of there mouth.  If they have to adopt a game face just to be around us I say that we are presenting a wrong image.              Later that night, I was taking L home, we started to talk a little about that, L was feeling the same way.  She felt like a lot of the attitude was centered on one person, X.  X emanated an aura of âcorrectnessâ X felt that they needed to correct other peoples speech, Liz slipped out the big sh**, X corrected her.  It offended Liz that someone whom she had never met before, felt like it was their place to correct her.  In all honesty it could have been done with all the love in the world, but it did not come across that way.              I am just saddened by even the possibility that we reinforced any negative preconceived notions that Rena had about Christians.  Where is the line?  What do we demand from people and where is there room for grace?

						               That which does not kill us makes us stronger.  This may be sound advice, but if you die, sometimes that is the easy way out.  I read an interesting out-take from a sermon about J.C. hanging in the boat, the sea is rough but he is sleeping away.  The disciples all are having a fit and decide to wake J.C. up, his first response is to question there fear, and faith.   Why are you afraid? What are you afraid of?  He rebukes the wind and saves the day.  The thought trail went something like: look at your life and the storms that fill it, when the storm is bad we look at JC and wonder why he is sleeping.              I personally entered a storm recently, I know He is out there looking out for my every move, but the storm is a little more intense than I thought it would be.  This storm happens to be one that involves other people, which makes the effort all the harder.  I have the fear that I will fail, that I will not succeed to my full potential.  This morning I had my PT test for the AF.  I had to do as many push-ups as I could in one minute, as many sit-ups as I could in one minute, than run 1.5 miles as fast as I could.  I was a little excited, I have not had to have a test of my knee sense the surgery, and I have not been keeping up with running every day so I was a little slower than I would have liked in the run.  I did manage to do 48 pu, and 48 su.  I ran the 1.5 mi in 11min 19sec.  I was feeling good till this other guy started the run, I kept up with him for about the first lap, but fell a little behind after that.  I finished second, about 50seconds behind the other guy and about 60 sec in front of the next guy.  I know it sounds stupid, but I was a little disappointed I thought I was going to do so well, and I did, I just did not do as well as I thought I would.  I have this nagging fear that I did not try hard enough, that I could have done things better; I could have gotten a better score.  I do not like the idea that I settled with out accomplishing my best.  I guess that is my fear for my life in general that I will not accomplish my goal due to my own lack of motivation.  I am still plagued by my memory of high school football.  I played football from fifth grade till freshman year of high school.  I quit my freshman year, despite my coachâs attempts at encouragement.  I did not have to quit, I made the choice to be fat and lazy.  That choice started a very hard time in my life.  I got fat, I hated school, I hated the people at the school.  I know in my mind that these things might have happened even if I had made a different choice; still I can not help but feel that that choice was one of those major junction points in my life.  I want to think that if I had stuck it out, that I could have had an amazing high school experience.  I know this is spilled milk kind of stuff, but what are our brains for if not for remembering all the stupid stuff that we have done.  M@

						               Well, I had an interesting meeting with a close-nit group of co-conspirators this last Thursday night.  I was so excited to go that I started the day before making some âwicked good baked beansâ.  So the purpose of the meeting was to discuss what we felt about Church, and what we wanted to do about it.  I got there a little early to simmer the âwicked good baked beansâ and have a little catch up chat with Shrek and Fiona (the names have been changed to protect the innocent).             The night turned out to be something amazing, imagine a group of intelligent people sitting around, drinking some Rolling Rock, eating BBQ and âwicked good beansâ and discussing a common goal that they are all passionate about.  It gave me one of those full body shivers.  I feel like I am at the start of a grand adventure, one that has no clear end in sight, but the journey will be one of epic proportions.  I feel like I just woke up in a strange land and I find that I am not alone but have stumbled on a group of people who I have instantly bonded to.  This group is not afraid to bring up tough issues, not afraid to question the accepted norm, there was a level of deep honesty that I could feel.  Perhaps it comes from the outside pressure.  I can feel the tension also, we were afraid.  What were we afraid of?  We were afraid of what the response of Church would be, would they brand us heretics? Subversive, rebellious, impetuous youth?  Or just plan old church splitters?  There is always fear when you step out from the established way, especially when it comes to religion.  How many times has Church seen its youth swept off in some new craze only to end up drinking poison in some South American jungle?  I know the heart of this group, and I know that this is not what we want; we want a partnership with Church.  We want understanding, someone to say it is OK to pursue God in the best way you can, and if we are not helping let us know how we can.  What we fear is the reaction âthat is not the way we did it so that is not the way it is doneâ.  I think I had a little taste of this when I went home that night.  I played a ânoomaâ video for my mom and dad (you should watch them all if you have not yet) it spoke volumes about what I was feeling.  It sparked some most excellent conversation with my parents.  I am looking forward to just being able to speak my mind.  I want someone to question our goal and intention.  We will see where it goes from here.

						   So I am sitting in Real Life, it is a college ministry put on by Calvary Chapel Corvallis.  Mark, the head pastor guy is leading worship.  I have had my run-ins with him before, I have never been able to put my finger on why but I am exceptionally critical of everything that he does.  I am usually a critical person, more so than some people, but something happens when I am around Mark.  I enter a different level of critical, it seems that what ever he says, I automatically start to look for ways that he is in contradiction somewhere in the bible.  Even if I have to twist a verse or two, it seems that I have some desire, no need, to be abrasive to him.  The more I think about this the more I realize how sad it is.  He could have something amazing to share with me and yet something, (pride? Arrogance?) is keeping me from even talking to this guy on the same level as a random guy walking down the street.  I guess that I do not like the idea of someone adopting the attitude that they are superior in ANY way, especially in matters of religion.              What set me off tonight was Mark singing along in true form, I was in a foul mood to begin with, so at the insistence that everyone stand up I was hit with this thought, âWhy would I stand up? How does this make me more in harmony with God?â So after the first song I sat down and started to journal some of this out, which led me to recap this last weekend, I was feeling great, I was opening up some thoughts in my brain that needed to be dusted off and preserved in a leak proof container.  Needless to say my attention was not anywhere near praise or singing, than something happened that snapped me out of my little dream world.  Mark was singing than he said, âWhy donât you all get down on your knees and praise the Lordâ.  I was floored; I have always had a problem with the whole raising your hands in church, at least when someone asks you to do it.  This seemed to be a whole new level, everyone just sat there still singing a little or looking around.  Mark repeats himself; âyou can all get down on your knees now and praise the lordâ than a few of his groupies did as they were bid and went down on their knees.  My journal looks something like: bla bla bla bal why the f*** is mark asking for kneeling down??!!! Bla bla bla bla.  OK so that is a word for word translation of that little encounter.  I was feeling so bad that I just got up and left to go get some ingredients for the wicked good baked beans.  Mmm they will be good.              Something that hit me as I was riding my bike back from Winco was that I was just journaling about my short comings and failures when the whole little encounter with the kneeling thing happened so I went from recounting my failures to being upset with this guy who I know nothing about but puts a great game face forward and hides his sin very well.  It was totally a scene out of the Simpsonâs, where you look over at the Flanderâs and they are all holy and than back to the Simpson family who are dark and rotten.  That is how I felt, looking at this guy who is oh so holy than back to my own failures and shortcomings.  I guess that I just do not know what to say about that.             So I was replaying some of my lifeâs worst moments in my mind my great failures.  Something that I thought was how far does Godâs grace cover?  I know that I have messed up in my life, a lot, lots of times, different places, and yet still it does not eat away at me as it does some people, I remember it and try and avoid the pitfalls that took me to those places.  Still I can post an entry full of details about my past or spill my guts to just about anyone who would listen.  I have a friend who is constantly riddled with the guilt of some of the same sins that I have in my life, he is truly tormented by what he has done.  I do not know how to feel about this.  Should I feel guilt, should I feel shame, should I even remember? (not that I could forget even if I wanted to)  Or is grace understanding forgiveness?  Forgiveness is putting it away right, as if it never happened so we hold on to this in our minds, as humans we continue to torture ourselves with the incessant memory.  If the perfect God who remembers to wake you up every morning can forget something, you would think my leaky brain and I could do the same.  -âMen donât follow title they follow courageâ (Braveheart) M@
