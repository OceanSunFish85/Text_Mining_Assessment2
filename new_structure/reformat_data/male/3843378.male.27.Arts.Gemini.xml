          SEANS MOTIVATIONAL CORNER      "It is I" said the Sean.. Back in your face for our first writing of Seans Motivational Corner.. Today's motivation is going to be about positivity.. I know every tree hugging hippy and their mother is telling you "smile" or love one another. But it is true.. Going to the extreme may be just a little too much but you can still do your best to refrain from the negative. Take this exampleâ¦ Just today while driving to the library some guy in a corvette in front of me slammed on his breaks.. I almost hit him (the sun was glaring on his break lights so I didn't see them go off).. He got upset and flipped me the bird. I promptly waved at him and smiledâ¦ I could just see the look of embarrassment on his face as he was trying to figure out why the heck I was smiling (was he thinking that I knew him, that I had something planned for the corvette, etc)â¦ That truly did make my day.. I'm sure it made his also. So back to the basicsâ¦always remember "You can do it".. That will carry you a long wayâ¦                      SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAND      Hey guys.. I have many friends with local bands and we must do our part to support them. Me and my crew are going to see Rock Star Club next   Friday August 6th at the Double Door  .. Be there or be queerâ¦ Click link below for more details.   urlLink http://www.rockstarclub.com/                 THE LOST PHENONEM OF THE REPRESSED DISC JOCKEY'S      A very strange thing happened after work on Saturday. Our office (for DJ's) has about a staff of 20+ dj's that goes out every Saturday evening to ROCK the suburbs. When we returned from our jobs last Saturday all of our frustration's came to a hilt.. We ripped our shirts off, broke a bunch of glowsticks and donned hats to become the village people and dance the YMCA. That is true.. You are reading that right.. The YMCA is a song we have played 2-3 times a week, every week for the past 6 years (in some cases 10+ years) of our lives.. Yet we were compelled to dress up and BE the village people.. Much like drag queens like to impersonate women, we impersonated the VILLAGE PEOPLEâ¦ ahhhâ¦ and it felt oooo sooooo good.. I was meant to be a Village Person. And I am OK with thatâ¦ WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE !!!              </post></Blog>
