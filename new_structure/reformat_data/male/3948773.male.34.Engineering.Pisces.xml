      I'm a gamer, but I got sick of video games after high school. I play real games: chess and go. Or maybe I should say go and chess (the occasional game of checkers is cool, too). But go is my true love (well, Marylou is my true love, but we're talking about games here!). I only play chess because it's easier to find people who play chess than go. But listen, go is the best game in the world. Why? Because it is beautiful. Two players take turns placing a single stone of their color (black or white) on the board. Stones are captured when they are surrounded. Whoever controls more space at the end of the game wins. The rules are incredibly simple, yet even the best computers can't play it worth a darn. That's because it is deeply strategic (as opposed to chess which is deeply tactical). The richness of the game and the simplicity of its elements makes it beautiful. Dont' take my word for it.  urlLink Play it yourself!

      I'm currently working on a pair of lace socks for my 3 year old daughter, Gabriella. I made her some basic ribbed socks about a year ago, but she has pretty much outgrown them. I guess we'll give them to Maya (my 5 month old) now!   Gabriella's socks (July 2004)  Yarn: Fortissima Colori, Socka Color (75% superwash wool, 25% polyamide) in a self-patterning, variegated (red, yellow, orange, brown, green, bluecolorway) Needles: Dual Addi turbo circulars in size 2 (for ribbing) and 3. Pattern: Shell Lace socks from page 16 of the XRX Socks, Socks, Socks book. Picture: coming soon!  In addition to those socks, I started making a vest for Gabby based on an idea I saw in the Summer 2004 Knitter's magazine. Squared up entrelac. Worked back and forth diagonally on straight needles, I made little squares which are connected at the corners. A picture will really help here. Anyway, I made the front, but it looks to be a little big, plus she doesn't need a vest right now with local temperatures pushing 100F, so it's on the back burner...

      Yes, I'm a knitter. Yes, I'm also a guy. Don't knock it -- knitting gives me something to do when there is time to kill -- on the train, waiting at the dentist/doctor, or when watching TV just isn't sufficiently stimulating. More that that, though, knitting provides everything I need to stay sane. First, there are the left-brain techniques of knitting -- there's a lot more to it than knit and purl, let me tell you. Lace knitting is particularly fascinating to me right now -- the tension of increases and decreases combine with the slack from yarn overs to balance out creating complex, yet regular textures. Second, when the pattern is mastered, the simple, repetive physical motions of its execution induce a calming, meditative state.Third, there is a great sense of satisfaction from having created something -- a hat, scarf, sweater, socks -- from just needles and a ball of yarn. Not only that, but it provides a very tangible connection to garment making now and in the past. I am certainly more aware and appreciative of the clothes we have available to us, especially the products of handknitters. Lastly, there is the ultimate pleasure of giving a gift which you have carefully, lovingly, and often arduously crafted with your own two hands. I feel that I am truly giving a piece of myself to someone when I give them a knitted gift.

      Okay, let's just get this out of the way. I am a Software Engineer. My high school math teacher always told me not to become a programmer because it would rot my mind. Well...perhaps he was right, but I manage to maintain a fair amount of variety in my work, so I'm not completely brain-dead yet. Besides, I play Go and Chess to keep the 'ol brain whirring. Currently I am responsible for both 1) maintaining the Software department web site, which keeps me up on HTML/CSS, ASP, databases and such things, as well as 2) porting our primary software product to work with newer, better compilers. Currently I've been using Microsoft Visual C++ 7.  My day generally goes something like this: get up at 5:30 to catch the train from Tracy (in the central valley) to San Jose. Arrive at work at 7:30 and press a few buttons on the computer. Ponder a deeply cryptic error message elicited by the latest compiler for a few hours. Try a bunch of things to get the error to go away. Of course, nothing works. Go to lunch for an hour -- maybe play some chess with a friend -- then stare at the error some more. Give up and enhance the intranet with some nifty new features, answer a few emails. About 3:30, try one last thing to get rid of that error message...voila! Solved. 4pm: go catch the train home. Of course, not every day is like this -- only the good ones. Sometimes I don't solve the problem until the next day (or the next week).  Despite the dryness of the work, it does contain an occasional gem of a problem whose solution is frustratingly difficult to determine, but, when solved, provides an immense sense of satisfaction. Yeah, it's a good job.

      Well, I have finally succumbed -- I'm a blogger. Mainly, I want a place to store my thoughts and experiences related to knitting, but I'm sure other stuff will creep in. In fact, I hope my parents, children, friends and relatives will enjoy browsing what is effectively a public diary. If there is something you would like to see here,  urlLink drop me an e-mail !
