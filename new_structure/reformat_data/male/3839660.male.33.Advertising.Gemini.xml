      Modern society operates under many falsehoods - and one of the larger ones that has an extraordinary effectiveness at keepingChristians quiet is the "H" word...Hypocrite. Here's how it goes:     Those who speak about Christ and their faith in the public arena (that is, anywhere outside of the home or church)arehypocrites unless they, themselves, are perfect in their own lives.     Got that? In fact, sometimes a person doesn't even needto speak publicly about his or her faith.Many times one can merely be a committed, practicingChristian andyet be labeled a hypocrite....Why you ask? Well, many believe that the simple act of attending mass regularly- of calling oneself a Christian - is a pious statement of moral superiority over others who do not attend. And ifa Christian has the gall to bring his or her faith into a public forum - to talk about Christ or his teachings - that individual risks a severe backlash...criticism that they are attempting to force their values on other people, and scorn if they fall short of those values in any public way. They risk the dreaded label of"hypocrite."    We don't like hypocrites in our society - one of the rare Christian values that has taken root in secular society. It connotes tremendous phoniness and lack of authenticity - something Christ attributed to the biblical Phariseeswho preached the letter of the law while violating the heart of the word. In today's age, "hypocrisy" has become one of the more damning chargesa personcan hurl at another. So it stands to reason that most of us try to avoid the label, keeping quiet about our faith and Christ's teachings. We leave the preaching tothe perfect people - that is, the real hypocrites. The rest of usemploy kind of a"don't ask, don't tell" policy in our lives so as not to place ourselves on any kind of moral pedestal. We tell ourselves that we'll wait to spread the word about Christ when we're better behaved - when we come closer to being the perfect Christian.Only thenwill weshare our religiousfaith with others. Of course, that day will never come because sharing the word of God is part of BEING a perfect Christian. If we shut others out of our faith and religious experiences, we will neverBECOME more perfect.    Today, the"hypocrite" label is atrap that acts to keep Christians in the closet.Yet the bible never tells usthat we need to beperfect to share the work Christ is performing inour lives.It doesn't say that we have to be biblical scholarsto share one ofChrist's teachings. Consider the model of  Alcoholics Anonymous . The whole premise of AA isonealcoholic helpinganother. For those of you who don't knowhow AA operates, when a newbie attendsa meeting for the first time, one of the first thingsthat happens is the newbie gets paired up with aSponsor.The Sponsor is, basically, a more seasoned recovering alcoholic whosupports and guidesthe newbiethrough the ten step recovery process. Although the Sponsor has been dry for a period of time, he or she isSTILL very much an alcoholic - still temptedby regularurges to have a drink. YettheSponsor is placed in the role of mentor and teacher to the newbie - one alcoholic teaching another alcoholic how to be sober, passing along moral guidance (and, in some cases, moral judgement)on the newbie's behavior. Thephilosophy, of course, is that the act of teaching and sharingIS a learning process in and of itself - it helps to reinforce the Sponsor's own commitment to sobriety, as much as it helps the newbie stay sober.    The greater parallel to life is obvious. We are all sinners. Should this be an obstacle to sharing Christ's work in our lives? Take me for instance...Let's say onthe way home from work I flip off another driver off who is blocking my wayon the freeway - then, a little later, I catch myself fantasizing about a female colleague at the office. I then get home from work andtake a phone call from a friendwho asks me how I've been doing. I think to myself how much I want towork up the courage to sharethe great work Christ has been performing in my life. I want to tell himhow fulfilling church has become to me lately. I want to share all of this with my buddy, yet I know I just committed road rage on the way home while mentally defiling a female colleague who isn't my wife. So the moral dilemma is...Should I keep my faith to myself for fear of becoming a hypocrite? Or should I share my good news? How would Jesus advise me?    Well, I think the answer is obvious - Jesus would want me to share the good news. I serve the Lord much better by sharing his good work, so that my friend might find hisown way to Christ's mercy - an in addition, so thatmy own faith and journey to becoming a more perfect Christian is strengthened. Of course, I am not off the hook for my behavior earlier in the day - not at all. Additionally, if I were to have told my friend how perfectly I'd been behaving since growing closer to the Lord...well then the"hypocrite" label would surely apply to me. But the simple act of sharing Christ's goodnewswith my friend, one sinner to another, was the best thing I could have done that day - especially given my poor behavior on the way home from work.    There aremany in society who believe in moral relativism. Theybelieve values are conditional for eachindividual and culture. They don't believe in truths, and they don't believe in a God that would speak in truths and absolutes. In fact, theybelieve religious people - those that follow a biblical-baseddenomination(as opposed to a new-age offshoot) - arebackwards, weakminded, and old fashioned.Why?...Well, I will explore this topic in another post, but for now just take my word for it.    Don't listen to these knuckleheads. We do not have to be perfect to talk about Jesus.In fact, Christasks us to tell others about him - he doesn't want bystanders, he wants participatory Christians.He wants us talking and communicatingwith one another about his church. He wants us to have asense of urgencyabout how much time we have on this earth to straighten out our lives. He doesn't want you sitting on the sidelines waiting for the magical day you suddenly become perfect enough to talk about him. After all,  hecame here for the imperfect people. Hisdisciples were imperfect people. King David, one of the most celebrated figures in the bible, committed several notorious sins.    Once I was in confession telling a priest how I felt unworthy to participate in theservice because of how poorly I had been leading my life. The priest looked me dead in the eye and told methatI'm atough case, and that Jesus likes thetough cases - the hard ones.I have to tell you that hearing him say thatmade me feel so good. It gave me hope.Jesus told us that the heart of the law is mercy. He came here to changethe hearts of the people that keep messing up - the cheats, the adulters, the liars, theassholes, etc., so if that's you -if you'rea "hard case" - then you'reexactly who Christ wantsin his church. He probably figures if he can win you over then you'relikely to bring in morejust like you, and his church will grow.    Don't worry about what modern society deems appropriate. Many (perhaps, most) of Jesus' teachings run counter to the values of modern society anyway. In these instances, they would have you be quiet so as not to pass moral judgment over others. But that's not want Jesus wants. He wants usto stand up for the truth - not to condemn others, but to spread his word no matter who it offends. He wantsus to come to church regardless of howperfectwe've behaved the weekprior. He wantsus to shareour religious feelingswith others even ifwe don't have it all worked out ourself.I am, myself, a chronic sinner. Thisblog is my way ofconnecting with my faithand understanding my own belief system in spite of my chronicsinning. I ask that God give me the strengthto resist modern society's attempt toshove me into the closet. I know that the only way I can become a better Christian is to talk about my faith, damn modern society's labels.

      Welcome to my blog.  Jesus once said to his disciples  "be perfect, like your father in heaven is perfect."   Yet they weren't living in 21st century society, a system that by any standard undermines faith values much more than it supports them.  Religious principles are simply not discussed in most social settings.  They are almost anathema in professional environments.  In fact, the very act of religious conversation makes many (if not most) uncomfortable - myself included.  It seems too personal or serious during most occasions - an intrusion into our private self.  Jesus keeps getting shoved deeper and deeper into the closet.  We let him out when socially acceptable...such as at mass, or alone in our thoughts - what amounts to a few hours (maybe) during one's week.     Yet, most of us allow SOCIETY'S values to dominate our conversation and thinking throughout the week: sex, money, success, power.  We freely talk about them  everywhere  and at  anytime .  Society's values rarely make us feel uncomfortable.  They pervade our homes, our workplaces, our schools, and most of our social occasions.  They are reinforced on television, radio and on the internet.  They make Christianity seem so far out of modern context that it feels natural to sweep the cross under the rug for all but a few hours of the week.  Once more, certain societal opinion-makers actually go so far as to ridicule or put down faith values AND those who espouse them, calling them narrow-minded, or simplistic, or unsophisticated, or at times even bigoted or hypocritical.  The very act of standing up for Christ is, in their view, wrong and harmful.  Is it any wonder why the world seems so twisted and confusing at times?  Intolerance of Christ's teachings has cast a shadow over us all, and the downward spiral of indignity and inhumanity in today's society reflects this.  It's time for us all to collectively step back from the brink and assume some spiritual leadership over our lives, our families, our communities and our church.  I am 33 years old and I've let society drive a wedge between myself and Christ.  I'll get into the reasons in further posts, but the fact remains that I have been spiritually bankrupt most of my adult life.  I have not been able to get any sustained, spiritual traction.  I don't blame it all on society, but society sure made it easier to hide Jesus in the closet.  This blog is intended to be a tool for me to bring Jesus back out and into my public life.  Jesus told us that those who are embarrassed of him in this life will share the reverse fate in the afterlife.  How could I let 33 years go by embarrassed of Christ?  This blog will hopefully be the start of the coming-out party.  Along the way I will share with you my thoughts on the lessons I have learned on the road to being a true Christian in the modern era.  I am hoping this will be both therapeutic, educational and spiritually uplifting for me - perhaps it will also be helpful for others to witness.  And as I share my thoughts about Christ in the virtual world, may Jesus give me the courage to let him out of the closet in the real world.  On another note, I am going to talk candidly in my blog.  In many ways, modern society is an enemy to the practicing Christian - and when battling any enemy, a key rule of thumb is to know how the adversary thinks and behaves.  In other words, I have to get real.  I can't discuss the pitfalls of 21st century societal values without, at times, getting very graphic and specific about all of its tests.  I think a weakness of many of today's preachers is their inability, or unwillingness, to get down into the trenches of modern sin and temptation by talking its language.  But this is where the battle is being waged for the hearts and souls of the 21st century Christian.  So that is where I will go, regardless of the topic.  Please know this about my blog.  Lastly, I dedicate this blog to the Lord Jesus Christ, my personal savior.  It is open to all who know and love Christ, regardless of denomination, and especially regardless of how imperfect you are as a Christian.  God sent his only son to heal the morally sick, not the morally perfect.  If you fall well short of Christ's standards on a daily basis, you will be in good company here.  My goal is that the Holy Spirit will work through me on this site.  My blog, as is my life, will be in his steady hands.  God Bless.

      As I have mentioned previously, I have had a long-standing struggle coming to terms with my own faith. At various interludes in my life I have "dabbled" in Christianity. I surely have never been closer to Christ than I was as a child, when I read the bible and prayed nightly. At the time I could not appreciate the innocence of my relationship. As a 33 year old I still crave the purity and simplicity of that connection I had with Jesus. I prayed to him like he was my father, best friend, and creator all rolled into one being. I felt his spiritual presence in a manner that still alludes me to this day.  That all ended when I reached 15 or 16 years old when I began putting Christ on the backburner. Part of my motivation for this boiled down to a desire to be cool and increase my social acceptance. To this end I viewed my close, personal relationship with Christ as baggage - literally, I felt it was holding me back. Additionally, this was the age were I began connecting with my inner desire to conquest the female gender romantically and sexually. It began to override my Christian sensibilities as I thought about sex and girls nearly around the clock. I couldn't envision these feelings coexisting with my close relationship with Jesus. Nearly overnight he began losing relevance in my life.  From age 15/16, through high school graduation and into college, I barely paid lip service to Christ. Even as an adult I was preoccupied with the goals of being cool and "hooking up" with women. Jesus was completely on the backburner at this juncture. I attended church ever so often - typically on religious holidays with my parents. I led a sinful and gluttonous lifestyle that drove a wedge between myself and my faith - a barrier of my own making. I rationalized this barrier by declaring myself unfit for Christ... that I was unworthy of a relationship with him. I believed that my very presence in his church was hypocritical and insulting, given my past behavior and unwillingness to immediately repent and change my ways. I substituted a relationship with Jesus with guilt over my lapsed faith, yet all along I believed that he would be there for me when I was ready. I knew it was wrong to feel this way - that there were no guarantees that I would be around long enough on this earth to engage Christ on my own timetable. Yet I did it anyway.  After college I attempted a reconciliation with Jesus, which lasted about 4-6 months, after which I proceeded to return to my previous behavior (with a vengeance I might add). It wasn't until about 26/27 when I began backing off from my wilder ways, seeking a more adult pattern of behavior for myself that included a search for a more serious female companion. In addition, this was the age where I began searching for the religious path that I had abandoned so many years before, attempting to pick up the pieces of my faith. I found out that it wasn't that easy.  Old habits are hard to break. I had not gone to church on Sundays since leaving home for college at 18. I had conditioned myself to thinking of God only when I was troubled. I had conditioned myself into taking my very soul for granted, gambling that I would still be around years later to repair the damage. I had poor moral hygiene - I was used to doing as I pleased. I had also lost any shred of the spiritual intimacy I had once felt with Christ. Like all relationships, they grow stronger with the investment of time and effort, and grow weaker with neglect. I woke up at age 27 with the inability to put one foot in front of the other from a religious standpoint. I didn't even know where to begin, and I continued to let bouts with temptation and sin estrange me from Jesus. I stumbled and bumbled my way into my 30's.  After 15 years of weakness, indifference and stupidity, I am putting back the pieces. Along the way I have uncovered some truths about this process. For starters, I've learned that sin and temptation are prisons of our own creation. Jesus rightfully condemns behavior detrimental to the soul, including sexual dalliances. But part of the reason Jesus hates sin so much is because it drives a wedge between human beings and his mercy - often by our own choosing. Like a fool, I conned MYSELF (no doubt, with the help of the devil himself) into believing that I should stay away from Christ until which time I was more worthy of his grace. I was literally in a prison of my own creation, allowing sin to stand like jail bars in the way of my reaching the one thing that could help set me free - a relationship with Jesus.  I finally asked a priest about my theory of "unworthiness" within the state of sin. He stated that although Jesus hated the sin, he would NEVER want it to prevent me from coming to him.  He told me there was healing power to be accessed at church - as a Catholic, he specifically cited the sacrament of communion as a channel that Jesus could use to reach me. He also reminded me of something I knew as a child - that the heart of the law of God is mercy. Jesus came here to earth not to condemn but to save. He dined with tax collectors and prostitutes. I was right in one aspect - that Jesus would be here waiting for me because he has loved me since before I was ever conceived. Guilt is not a sufficient replacement for a relationship with Jesus. Guilt will not get you into heaven. Jesus wanted me in church in spite of my sinful ways so he could reach me in a manner of his choosing. Yet I felt I knew better. I stayed away and waited until my late 20s, wasting a portion of my life.  Today, I am a committed husband, and a struggling, yet determined, Christian. I will never let sin stand in the way of being in God's presence again. Yet I still deal with temptation... sexually and otherwise. I believe that this is one of the challenges Jesus has given me. He knows how I think and he knows what motivates me. I believe he expects me to exert my willpower and resist it. At the same time he is calling me to worship him, to help grow the family of believers, and to administer to those less fortunate. Along the path he will give me the tools that I need to fight my temptations and improve as a person. There is nothing for me to be embarrassed about and certainly nothing that ought to keep me away from his mercy. Temptations and sin are a part of everyone's life. We are obligated to carry them like a cross and move forward on the path.
