      Iâm feeling subdued today. It was another âparty weekendâ and while it wasnât quite as crazy as last weekend, it was crazy enough and I had to spend some time replaying the dayâs events, checking them over rather gingerly to see what, if anything, I had to be embarrassed about.   I met my upstairs neighbor at 9:00 Sunday morning to go watch Denverâs gay pride parade. The parade was okay, a little longer than I preferred to stand, but the weather was cool and slightly overcast, and the people watching is always good. After the parade we headed down to the âPride Festâ stopping for three or four beers on the way. It was only 11:00am, so I was feeling a little nervous about drinking too much. We stayed at the Pride Fest for several hours, drank a couple more beers, and then my neighbor suggested that we head over to a local bar for their Beer Bust -- $7, all you can drink. Another perhaps not-so-good idea. I suggested that we swing by our building first, I couldâve used a shower and a chance to check my phone messages, but my neighbor wanted to go to the bar right away, and so we did.   Iâve noticed before that my neighbor has a tendency to forget his money, or at least to forget which pocket it is in, and this happened while we were paying to get into the bar. His cash was misplaced long enough for me to buy the entrance tickets for the two of us, and then he really couldnât break his twenty. He also has the disconcerting tendency to suggest to total strangers that perhaps Iâd like to buy them a beer, or a bratwurst, or that I find them attractive. This can be funny for a very short while, but I donât like it. I donât like making fun of people, and thatâs what this feels like. It also feels like heâs making fun of ME. I havenât spent enough time with this guy to know how to react, yet, but from now on Iâll just calmly tell the person involved that whatever theyâve been told isnât true, very sorry. Maybe that will stop him. Assuming I go out with this guy any more.   Before I knew it, it was getting close to 9:00. Iâd been pacing myself, but Iâd still drunk more than I intended to. I was feeling guilty about the fact that a friend of mine, who drives down from Summit County most Sunday nights, was probably waiting at my place. I told my neighbor that I had to go home, and suddenly he was inviting two strangers to come back to my place. I know he just wanted a ride home, and I also knew that he would most likely head back to his place, leaving me to entertain two strangers, so I put my foot down. âIf my friend is at my placeâ I said, âitâll just be awkward and not fun. You can invite people back to your place, but I canât do this tonight.â It didnât help that Iâd drunk enough that I found one of the guys kind of attractive, and did some minor kissing before we left. I also gave him my phone number, damn it, and was annoyed when I found out that Billy had been feeding him the line that I thought he was âcute.â Iâd thought no such thing, but that was enough to get the guy hitting on me, and Iâm pretty easy to hit on when Iâve been drinking. Sad, but true, and a reason I stopped going to the clubs years ago.   I had to finally leave the bar and stand on the sidewalk, waiting for my neighbor to come out. I didnât care if he stayed or not, I just had to get home. Apparently he didnât want to stay alone, because he eventually came out, complaining that it was so âearlyâ and annoyed that no one would give us a ride for the three or four blocks home. I felt badly when I got home and found that my friend had been waiting there for a couple of hours.    I guess what it boils down to is that Iâve been making choices lately that donât reflect the man I want to be. Going out dancing can be a lot of fun, and even drinking can be fun, but doing both of those things in excess drains me. I woke up this morning feeling a little depressed, embarrassed and as if something unpleasant were waiting for me. Instead of feeling great and ready to take on the week, I had to spend time wondering if Iâd done anything the night before that I needed to be horrified by. (Letâs seeâ¦ gave that guy my numberâ¦ kissed a total strangerâ¦ spent more money than I could affordâ¦ drank too muchâ¦). I mentally compared those feelings with how I feel the day after a long hike, or bike ride, or even just hanging out at my parentsâ place, playing with my nieces. (A little tiredâ¦ relaxedâ¦ maybe a little soreâ¦ healthierâ¦).   Iâm going to stop hitting the bars. I think maybe once every couple months can be okay, but I want to come back to work on Monday feeling refreshed and healthy instead of a little depressed and tired.   I still havenât started my â urlLink Total Body Transformation â workout. It seems like a battle just getting past this constant weekend  urlLink MESSiness . Iâm hoping that once I stop doing these energy-draining things that I can expend my energy in these healthier pursuits. Next weekend Iâm going to focus on wholesome, energy-building activities, see how I feel, especially compared to how I feel today and how I felt last week. Unfortunately, one of the promises I made while under the influence of alcohol was to watch my neighborâs dog while heâs out of town for the 4th. Now that Iâm sober, Iâm not too happy at the thought of spending my three-day weekend saddled with someoneâs pet, but I promised to do it and Iâll do it.

      The Monkey reigned supreme this weekend. In fact, there was so little resistance from the Warrior side of me that I was pretty damn much a Monkey the whole time. I was just mindful enough to know how foolish I was being, and Monkey enough not to stop the behavior. If I were to give too many details Iâd have to have an âAdults Onlyâ disclaimer attached to the site. Suffice it to say I was up all night Saturday and didnât have time for any naps on Sunday.   Is it possible to be âjust mindful enoughâ or is that an all-or-nothing deal? Sometimes it seems as if thereâs a small, sensible voice in my head saying something like âdonât try that  urlLink MESS â¦ or eat another six cookiesâ¦ or stay up much laterâ¦ or skip another workoutâ¦â I can hear the voice, but I donât heed it. I donât want to heed it. I donât think that this little voice represents  urlLink mindfulness , but Iâm still trying to figure out exactly what mindfulness is. My best guess at this point is that mindfulness is never being on autopilot, but making conscious decisions about everything Iâm doing. If Iâm mindfully indulging in more MESS than is good for me, is that better than performing the same indulgence while on autopilot?   It was an especially stressful week at work, with a potentially stressful week waiting after the weekend. I was walking home from work on Thursday around 8:30pm when I decided that since the evening was shot anyway, I might as well make it a little later and get a haircut. The young woman who called my name was pretty intense looking in a punk-goth chick kind of way. Dyed black hair, tattoos on each arm from wrist to elbow, a sullen expression. The sullenness remained while she gave my hair a cursory washing, and clipped the sides. Then, apparently deciding that at least some conversation should happen, she asked what I did for a living. I told her and she said âdo you like it?â I was just tired enough to answer relatively truthfully: âI like it better than any other job Iâve had, but it still doesnât feel quite right to me.â Somehow this led to me admitting that I was looking into various aspects of my spirituality, and she perked right up. âYou mean, like, God and shit?â she said, âIâm a big time Christian, and I totally believe in all that shit.â She went on to rant and rave about the current state of the masculine mindset in America. She said that she believes men are superior to women, and that women should be submissive to men, but that Internet porn is messing up all men so badly that itâs tough to find a man strong enough to take charge of his family. She was so excited to be telling me this stuff that she really wasnât paying much attention to my haircut (it shows), but at one point she said something that caught my attention, something like âWell, the Bible says that the road to hell is, like, really wide but the road to holiness is really narrow.â   Yeah, the Bible does say something like that, I looked it up, the reference comes from the book of Matthew: âGo in by the narrow door; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction, and great numbers go in by it. For narrow is the door and hard the road to life, and only a small number make discovery of it.â It was one of the precepts of my childhood, not that I gave it much thought. After all, at the ripe old age of ten, I already knew good and well that Iâd long since gone in by the narrow door and was well on my way to heaven.   Now Iâm not so smug and the concept is clearer to me. Sex, drugs, dancing and gluttony were all part of my weekend. They crowded out nearly everything else â no time for meditation, exercise, order and balance. No time for sleep, or even for eating very much. The MESSy stuff was easy to start, and even easier to continue. The other things take conscious decision-making, willpower and self-discipline.   But â I liked it. I really did. Part of me was quite literally and consciously glorying in the over-the-top imbalance of my behavior. How do I defeat that? Why does part of me long for health and balance, while an even bigger part seeks out my own self-destruction? The self-destruction feels good (at least so far) and the health and balance call for sweat, self-discipline and growth, which do not feel so good, and always involve at least some discomfort. The behavior in which I indulged this weekend, if unchecked, can lead to disease, shame and misery. The dedicated search for mindfulness and growth leads to health, balance, beauty and eventually joy in all aspects of life.   So why the hell do I keep jumping on the slippery slide? This must be where a teacher comes in. The minister, the confessional, the counselor â someone who can say âstudent, youâre making mistakes. Stop. Do this instead.â Where do I find this teacher, and even when found, what makes me take the advice? How do I tip the scales from Monkey to Warrior?   My hope is that the desire is a first step. Iâve got the desire. This morning I didnât think I had time to meditate or work out (I slept late, hoping to soothe my body after 29+ hours of wakefulness). I meditated for five minutes. A small step, but a step.

      Busy day at work today â lots to do, and I spent four hours in a corporate meeting instead of actually doing the work.   Yesterdayâs workout (in which I worked to focus on my breath instead of my Monkey Mind) turned out to be so effective that my legs and glutes are incredibly sore today. That made sitting on a hard hotel chair for several hours rather uncomfortable. Even more uncomfortable was my attempt to maintain good posture as much as possible. Iâve started implementing what  urlLink Steve Ilg  refers to as the âbeeper guru.â Iâve got a  urlLink small clock  that attaches to my belt and can be programmed to vibrate at set intervals. Every hour it would vibrate quietly at my hip, reminding me to check my posture and attitude. Iâd usually be slumping, or hunching, or leaning and would straighten out, straighten up, and try to maintain good postureâ¦ until Iâd forgetâ¦ and then the buzzer would go off again. Oh darn itâ¦ Iâm slumping even as I type this. A couple of co-workers asked if I'd lost weight, so apparently good posture takes off a few pounds as well.   Iâm working late tonight, but need a break before diving back into the writing project Iâve got due tomorrow. The Monkey came out of a meeting a couple of hours ago in full tantrum mode â I was feeling stressed out and cranky because it was increasingly obvious that I was going to need to work late. Not that working late is a big deal to me, but I thought that a friend of mine was going to be coming into town this evening, and I didnât want to miss spending time with him.   I was wrong â heâs visiting tomorrow, and so now it is not only embarrassing but pointless that I stomped back into my department, saying that I âhated everything, hated my job, wasnât even sure why Iâd ever been born.â (Such drama.) I started off trying to sound as if I were joking, but my normally garrulous co-workers all looked busily at their computers as one does when one doesnât know how to react to a nervous breakdown happening right in front of one. The guy who sits across from me later asked if I was doing okay. He was obviously so concerned that I felt like a complete ass and apologized.   So, why did I get so upset? I get cranky and irritable sometimes at work (who doesnât) but Iâm generally a pleasant person to be around, the Department Klown, Laff-a-Minute, thatâs me. I wonder if this whole spiritual focus stuff Iâm doing (and Iâve hardly touched on the physical yet) is already more stressful than I expected it to be. I suppose itâs possible, although Iâm probably making an excuse for myself. Whenever I get slammed at work with too many projects and not enough time I go into panic mode, and usually express it as anger. And then? I get all the work done, everything is fine, and I wonder why I couldnât have done everything with calm elegance instead of being a Big Baby.   I ran across the concept of  urlLink aparigraha  today while reading Steve Ilgâs daily web log. Yikes. Itâs something Iâve been thinking about for the past year or so, I just didnât have a name for it. Basically itâs the Yogic yama (ethical precept) of non-greed, non-attachment or non-possessiveness.   I bought my first home a year ago, an 820 square foot condo with no storage at all. I was concerned about what Iâd do with my stuff, particularly the things Iâd crammed into a crawl space in the apartment Iâd been renting for three years. As I pulled items from the crawl space I discovered that most of the items had been ruined by dampness and the stuff that was still in good condition hadnât been used for at least three years. Even at that, I still had a tough time giving away a lot of it. Whatâs up with that? I donât ever want to be like a distant relative of mine who couldnât throw anything away. She spent her last years living in an apartment so crammed with junk that she had to move through tiny aisles lined with tottering piles of magazines, books, boxes of clothing, old kitchen utensils, ancient craft sets from the 1960âs, a few good antiques, and a lot of what turned out to be nothing more than trash â junk that shouldâve been recycled decades earlier.   I used to have a friend who couldnât throw away old newspapers. I never had the courage to ask him what he was going to do with them all, but his apartment balcony was completely unusable â neat stacks of yellowed, moldering newspapers filled nearly the entire space. They werenât covered, protected or intended for use, so I couldnât even imagine why he kept them. The rest of his apartment was relatively neat, but he had a lot of framed posters and prints piled against the bedroom wall, and a spare bedroom so crammed with unused, ugly furniture that you could hardly open the door.   So, Iâm grateful that my new place has two tiny closets and no storage unit. If I buy something new, I need to get rid of something old, and even at that my closets are crammed full of things. I keep thinking that I need to get my closets professionally organized but maybe what I really need to do is get rid of the stuff Iâm not using.   Itâs surprisingly difficult to get rid of some of these things, but when I do manage to take a load of old clothes, dishes, appliances, CDs, cassette tapes and trinkets to the thrift store Iâm amazed at how damn GOOD it feels. Itâs gone!    Applying that same principle to my body is even more difficult. Do I really need this extra thirty pounds of energy Iâm carting around? Itâs not likely that a famine is on the way, or that Iâm going to suddenly run out of money to buy food. Did I really need the extra calories I ate yesterday? Oh, yuck. The answers are obvious.   Itâs easy to write about, but itâs much harder to actually take a plump, spoiled Monkey and work to turn him into a lean, mindful Warrior. In fact, I feel a bit overwhelmed when I think of the sheer mountain of work ahead of me. I guess that's where the whole one-step-at-a-time thing comes in. I got home last night intending to at least spend some time meditating. Instead I glanced at the waiting  urlLink zafu , listened to the Monkey, got a little MESSed up, and watched the deep, profound and uplifting world of H.R. Pufnstuf unfold on DVD.

      Blogging feels differently than I expected it to. I thought it would feel like typing out a journal entry, but I feel as if Iâm on a stage with bright lights in my eyes. There may be an audience out there, and there may not. The chances of anyone other than me actually reading this are relatively slim, but I find myself picturing my mother, grandmother, and co-workers poring over these words. Iâm also a little worried about accidental copyright infringement as I quote bits of the book from which Iâll be working. Iâll work through it as I go along.   While my daily life will pop into this blog, Iâm going to work to keep the focus on what I experience while working through the program outlined in  urlLink Steve Ilg âs book â urlLink Total Body Transformation .â   I worry as I re-read my words that I sound pompous as hell, but Iâm really not. Call it stage fright; things will loosen up as I go along.   Iâm having a tough time deciding how to refer to the Monkey and the Warrior. Theyâre both me, and I donât want to appear to blame things on the Monkey as if itâs some outside force influencing my life. Iâll be playing with the references until I find a way that works. Currently Iâm using the Monkey to refer to myself when Iâm unaware, putting on disguises, acting out of control, and living in an unhealthy way. The Warrior is the part of me pursuing growth, living mindfully, and embracing weakness in order to transform it. âIâ am the combination of the two, a  urlLink yin/yang symbol  gone awry, seeking balance and trying to wake up.   As I write about this whole physical/spiritual growth process Iâll have to touch on the things I use to feed the Monkey â sex, food and drugs (caffeine, alcoholic beverages and other recreational drugs all fall into this category). Iâm not so foolish as to admit to, or appear to endorse, any type of illegal drug use, so Iâll just refer to âem collectively as âMonkey Enlightenment Spiritual Substitute(s)â or âMESS.â   In âTotal Body Transformationâ, Steve Ilg writes âWe use recreational drugs to get a âhitâ of an enlightened state . . . just remember that drug use weakens your life force. Wish it could be different, but that is the way the game is played. Everything about spiritual awakening is about looking inside, not outside, yourself.â True, but damnâ¦ getting MESSed up can be fun. The Monkey whispers to me that becoming spiritual and giving up my MESS will turn me into a boring person.   I wonder instead if itâs something like cherries. Someone at work has those  urlLink sour cherry candies  â theyâre sweet, tart, and slightly bitter (thanks to an overdose of red food coloring). I like them, but if you were to put them next to a bowl of freshly picked sour cherries, there wouldnât be much similarity. Some people doubtless prefer the candies to the cherries. Is it possible that after years of getting regularly MESSed up, I may prefer the artificial enlightenment âhitâ to the real thing?   Probably not. If I truly prefer the artifice of MESS to true spiritual enlightenment, then Iâll never seek enlightenment in the first place. MESS attracts me because it allows me to live moment-to-moment, represses my social inhibitions and makes me feel as if Iâm more my true self. I stop worrying about bills, love handles and deadlines and enjoy myself. If I could live like that all the time without the distressing side effects of getting MESSed up, I would. Itâs time to grow up and find the real thing, time to stop gorging myself on the artificial flavors and find the true fruit.   The Monkey in me didnât want to lift weights this morning, but didnât have a choice. Iâve been working weekly with an  urlLink awesome personal trainer  for the last year, and while it puts more of a strain on my budget than I like, itâs really been the only thing keeping my exercise program moving at all. More weeks than Iâd like to admit, my workout with Gregg is the only workout I get.   I noticed a difference today â I focused on my breath, which helped me ignore the chattering Monkey telling me that I was getting TIRED damn it and wanted to QUIT and couldnât do ANY MORE. I had a great workout, and my form was a lot better. I suspect that my previous workout sessions â all of them through the years â have been feeding my ego/Monkey rather than the Warrior. I exercise to get more of the things that make the Monkey happy: affirmation, accolades, casual sex. Those things are enjoyable, but none of them have been enough to keep me from putting on a few more pounds every year.   Iâm 37 years old as of this past April. I stand 5â11â, and my scale weight this morning was 206 pounds. While thatâs at least 30 pounds more than I should weigh, it doesnât look as bad as it sounds. Iâm âluckyâ enough to put on weight pretty evenly over my body, and I exercise enough so that if Iâm careful with my clothes, mind my posture and remember to hold everything in, I look okay in the right light. Put me in a bathing suit, make me laugh, and the illusion falls apart. Iâll take some measurements soon, and if I can bear the thought of standing in front of someone without putting on any  urlLink glamours  Iâll get a photo taken. I hate the thought of being so revealed, but perhaps itâs another exercise in beating down the Monkey.  Had a birthday lunch for a co-worker today. I usually hate those things â too many people, lots of confusion about the bill, and I never seem to spend any time talking with co-workers I enjoy. This was well organized by a co-worker who pre-ordered the food and calculated the bill in advance. There was a LOT of heavy Italian food, served family style, and the Monkey wanted to dig in right away. With some prompting from the Warrior I filled the plate with about half as much food as the Monkey wanted, and it was still more than I needed. The Monkey hated to see about half of the desserts left on the table, and tried to convince me that eating more would prevent waste. The Warrior reminded me that eating more than I need is just as wasteful as throwing the food away.

      About six weeks ago I ran across an image of the book " urlLink Total Body Transformation " on line. Author  urlLink Steve Ilg 's photo reminded me of someone I like, and I'm always up for reading a new fitness book, so I clicked on the link and read the reviews. I was intrigued and reserved the book through my local library.   I was not expecting the intensity with which the book communicated to me. It surprised me, forced me to take a look at my body and my spirit in a way that was new to me.   Iâve been reading fitness books most of my life, starting with the  urlLink Charles Atlas  booklet I ordered from an old comic book when I was eleven years old. I learned pretty quickly that actually purchasing these books was a waste of resources: they all pretty much said the same thing in different ways, and none of them inspired me for long (assuming I even finished reading them). Iâd check them out of the library with some hope, and send them back with disappointment. Iâve kept looking, hoping to find something that would finally shake my thirty-seven-year-old body and spirit out of the doze in which Iâve spent much of my life.  My biggest problem with the books was that I couldnât relate to the authors. True fitness is something Iâve desired my whole life, in much the same way Iâve ever desired anything beautiful and rare, but Iâve never yet found enough joy in the process to go any further than my gotta-keep-from-getting-too-flabby minimum workouts. The authors of the books I read obviously took a great deal of pleasure in developing and maintaining their own fitness, but werenât able to help me find that joy. I longed to emulate them, but could never translate the programs they outlined into real, permanent, life-changing action. Once the novelty wore off, Iâd revert back to my standard exercise routine.   So what about this particular book is different? Steve Ilg's path in life has been dramatically different from mine. When I was growing up I spent all of my spare time indoors reading, afraid of my peers, awkward at sports and doing everything I could to stay hidden and inconspicuous. (I succeeded so well that when I was eighteen and moving out of my parentsâ home, one of the neighbors asked who I was. Weâd lived a few houses up the street from her for fourteen years, and sheâd always assumed my brother and sister were my parentsâ only children.)  While I was reading in my bedroom, he was racing bikes and climbing mountains. And yet, he wrote a book that I can understand, relate to, and am already applying to my life.   The spiritual tradition in which I was raised seemed designed to instill fear rather than joy. I've spent the last decade or so working to deconstruct those old beliefs, but haven't had anything with which to replace them. I've been tentatively exploring different aspects of meditation and yoga -- even a bit of super-basic  urlLink Zen . Steve Ilg introduced me to the concept of developing and nurturing my spiritual life through the combination of ego-bashing physical workouts, yoga and meditation. This makes so much sense to me that I wanted to cry out âOF COURSE! FINALLY!â He calls those who take this particular approach "Fitness Warriors."   I was excited about the book, and tried explaining it to a friend of mine. His response was "so, this guy is telling you to worship your body?" I couldn't think of a good response, and had a sudden moment of disappointment. Was that all there was? A new -- and in my case rather shoddily maintained -- idol to worship? Well, no, actually. My take on the whole thing is that exercise and the pursuit of fitness can be -- should be -- as much of a spiritual exercise as meditation and prayer. But I won't know until I've tried this myself.   Last year I learned a little about the  urlLink Zen Buddhist  concept of the "Monkey Mind," something that sounds a lot like the "ego" Steve Ilg talks about fighting. I've spent a lot of time listening to my monkey and ignoring my warrior.   Another thing that makes me think this is more "real" to me than other programs is that I immediately, almost unconsciously, started to incorporate what I read in "Total Body Transformation" into my life. Itâs been no more than a month, resistance is strong, and most of the time the "monkey me" still wins the battle. But Iâve started on a path that feels like the right one, and I'm becoming increasingly aware that I've still got a warrior in my soul.   Steve Ilg has an  urlLink online journal  that I check out regularly, and I've got to say, it's tough for me. Reading about the intensity with which he and his students push themselves can be disheartening at times -- I'm having a hard time dragging myself out of bed to go for a 40-minute run around a city park, and he's writing about intense four-hour workouts that combine bike riding, rock climbing, snowshoeing and trail running.    But then I remember that the key word is  urlLink intensity , not ability or experience. I remind myself that while the current level of my activities would be low-key to one of these long-term "fitness warriors", my workouts are still intense to me and the struggle with the ego/Monkey Mind is probably pretty similar.   Now comes the hard part. Can I actually incorporate these disciplines into my life? Is this inspiration real, or just short-term enthusiasm for another flash-in-the-pan exercise routine? It's harder than I expected to even write about these issues -- I'm feeling suddnely shy about my new explorations into different spiritual traditions, and writing about "warriors" and "monkeys" wants to trigger the deep-seated cynicism I've developed over the years.   I want to pursue this further, because as much as I may feel shy and cynical, I'm also feeling more awake and self-aware than I have in a long time. I feel as if Iâve been asleep, but that some sunlight has fallen my closed eyes. I can wake up, or shove my head back under the covers and return to my dreams. I want to wake up.  Those moments of wakefulness Iâve been experiencing are painful sometimes. Experiencing mindfulness means taking a hard look at the current state of my body, mind and spirit and I canât say that I like all of what I see.   I've decided to give this program a try. I want to keep a journal as I go through the process, and since I've wanted to try "blogging" for a while, I decided to combine the two. Since I'm beginning a conscious battle to fight my "Monkey Mind" and develop my "Warrior" I'll be creating these journal entries as a documentation of that fight. All of this is new to me, including the spiritual traditions I'll be discussing and exploring. I'm looking forward to finding out where this will all lead.   I guess at this point itâs also important to make the (hopefully obvious) statement that everything Iâve written is my own interpretation of Steve Ilgâs book. To draw your own conclusions, get a copy and read it.

      Iâve been having a tough couple of weeks â Iâve been feeling depressed about my job and about my current physical state. I havenât been working out regularly, Iâve been feeling crappy and Iâve been indulging in too much MESS.   Itâs time for a change.   Iâve been waiting years for some epiphany to happen, epiphany in the sense of âA comprehension or perception of reality by means of a sudden intuitive realization.â I wanted something to happen that would finally kick my ass enough to get me to change the way I live. The thing is, epiphany isnât usually magical â it often seems to involve some Last Straw, some final humiliation or health crisis that triggers someone to say, âDamn it, if I donât do this, Iâm going to DIE.â   This morning, as I have for pretty much every morning for the past year, I dragged myself out of bed. I felt like crap â exhausted, low energy, unwell. I wouldâve gone back to bed, except today is my workout with my excellent personal trainer. Lately thatâs been the only workout I get, other than my daily walk to and from work, so I absolutely donât miss it. It was a tough workout, but more because Iâve been feeling so low energy lately. I got home and had to lie down for a while before I could even get ready for work, and then had to call in late.   This is getting ridiculous. Iâm low energy, have a low libido, feel depressed most of the time and try to self-medicate with food and recreational drugs. My wardrobe is shabby, because I hate shopping for clothes. I hate shopping for clothes because I hate buying pants in a 36â waist. I usually end up buying something cheap because Iâm âgoing to lose weightâ and donât want to waste money on expensive clothing that wonât fit soon.   My neighbor sent me some snapshots heâd taken of me during the gay pride festival a couple of weekends ago. I thought I looked pretty good that day, but the photos told a different story â my belly was obvious through my shirt and I looked unfit and unwell. Monday I came into work and someone said, âAre you sleeping very well? Your color isnât very good.â No, Iâm NOT sleeping very well, actually. Part of that is because Iâve given up self-medicating myself every damn night and my body is taking some time to adjust, but part of it is because itâs hard to sleep after binging on food.   I was dragging my feet to work this morning, an hour and a half late, and I decided that Iâve Finally Had Enough. Damn it, Iâm 37 years old, far too young to feel as if I can hardly muster the energy to get out of bed in the morning. If I feel like this now, what can I expect in thirty or forty years? Iâm 30 pounds overweight now â if I continue to go on like this, how much will I weigh when Iâm fifty or sixty? So, Iâm finished with this, damn it. Iâm going to lose thirty pounds by the end of October and then Iâm going to see how I feel. Iâm also going to schedule a physical exam for the end of October. I used to get one every year, and then I started thinking Iâd âwait until I lost a few pounds.â Well, I havenât lost a few pounds so I havenât been going back. The last time I had an exam, a couple of years back, the doctor told me that my cholesterol was too high and that if I didnât get it down Iâd probably be on medication by the time I was in my forties. Screw that. Iâm done with this.   By October 27th I will weigh 30 pounds less than I do today. I didnât weigh myself this morning, but I assume Iâm still hovering around 205 pounds. By the end of October Iâll be hovering around 175 pounds. Thereâs no doubt about it. If this is epiphany, then Iâve had it.

      A couple of weeks ago, my sister asked âwasnât I supposed to get an e-mail from you?â I felt an immediate flare of resentment, knowing exactly what she was talking about. âYou send the damn e-mail,â I wanted to say. âWhy do I have to do everything?â I swallowed the resentment and told her Iâd been busy, but it still annoyed me.  You see, I have historically sucked big time at accomplishing my goals. I keep trying the same old crap â get fed up with the way things are, make dramatic promises to myself, go out and pour money into âfixingâ things, jump into the project with great enthusiasm, and thenâ¦ just kind of stop. Iâve been thinking for a long time now that the only way to break out of that behavior pattern is to hold myself accountable to someone, but when Iâve tried in the past Iâve either chickened out at the last minute or teamed up with someone who doesnât hold up their end of the agreement. For instance, I might ask a friend to call me every week to ask if Iâve been doing my workouts. Heâll call for a couple of weeks, and then miss a weekâ¦ and then another weekâ¦ and then eventually he never calls at all. Sure, I could remind him, but by then my own enthusiasm has drained away so I donât mention it.  This came up the other day when my dad mentioned seeing a televised interview with  urlLink Barbara Sher , author of several goal-setting books. I know Barbara Sherâs books. Hell, Iâve read most of them at least twice. Iâm a big fan of self-help books, but usually end up following their advice by making dramatic promises to myself, jumping into the project with great enthusiasmâ¦ you get the picture.  I was in an unusually open mood that evening, and shared my frustrations with my parents. My mother and sister have their own similar issues, and in a burst of enthusiasm we all decided to purchase copies of â urlLink Wishcraft ,â form our own success group and finally reach our goals. Hooray!  So, we read the book. Or, we meant to. We kept talking about getting together, never quite did. I got a feeling of familiar resignation â another goal set, another goal slipping away, unmet. Damn it, I wasnât going to let it happen this time. I told my sister that I was going to outline the basic steps and send an e-mail to her and my mother. We were going to do this.  Only, I never quite got around to it. Hence, her comment about the e-mail and my flair of resentment. Her comment kept nagging at me. Finally I sat down and typed up the steps and the e-mail, but never sent it. Why wasnât I sending the message?  Yesterday I realized that part of me really doesnât want to reach my goals. I mean, I really DO want to reach them, but I want to reach them magically. I want to wake up tomorrow with an excellent physique and minus thirty pounds of fat. I donât want to wake up tomorrow and do dumbbell squats until my muscles burn. Part of me just wants to daydream about being fit and then go sit on the couch, eat pizza and read â urlLink The Traveling Vampire Show .â (Itâs not a very good book, but I read it anyway. It was easier than going for a run.)  The Warrior made one of his rare comments. âIf you really want to do thisâ he said, âthen you need to take the initiative. Your sister and your mother may or may not reach their own goals, but you know theyâll be true to the commitments theyâll make to you.â  So, today I sent the e-mail. The Monkey screamed a lot, told me that theyâd just drive me crazy, that this would never work, that weâd never find the time, that Iâd be sorry. I hit the âsendâ button anyway. I told them that we need to meet before August 28 to set our goals and that we need to commit to meeting for at least twelve weeks.  This isnât going to be easy. Itâs hard to discuss my dreams with people who in some ways know me better than anyone, and who in other ways donât know me at all. You see, theyâre both very Christian and have a tough time with the fact that Iâm gay. Heck, it hasnât been easy for me being gay either. I spent ten years trying hard  urlLink not to be gay  before deciding there were a lot of important issues in my life that didnât involve homosexuality and were being ignored. I also began to wonder why god was so concerned with my sexuality to the exclusion of everything else, and started taking a long, hard look at my fundamental religious beliefs.  The end result has been that my life has changed a lot â but not in ways I feel comfortable discussing with my family, and not in ways theyâre comfortable hearing about. Perhaps this will be a way to heal that gap. Maybe itâll just be another failed attempt to find accountability and partnership as I try to find my dreams. Regardless, I took the first step.

      A few years ago, I had a job that occasionally involved teaching classes to twenty-five or thirty people. A friend of mine used to go on and on about how âbraveâ I was to be able to do that. Itâs nearly impossible for her to stand in front of a crowd and speak â sheâs one of the people who rank the  urlLink fear of public speaking  above the fear of death.  The thing is, itâs not particularly courageous of me to stand in front of a crowd and speak publicly. Sure, I might get a few nervous flutters before I begin, but once Iâve started, itâs no problem. I enjoy doing it. If my friend were to get up in front of a crowd and speak, she would be brave. Iâm doing something that comes easily to me. I can still grow and become better â being able to do something doesnât mean I can automatically do it well â but itâs not difficult for me to get started. Taking a class in public speaking wouldnât be difficult for me, because I donât have to overcome any fear. Taking lessons in football or hockey would be an exercise in jaw-clenching panic for me because they would touch on every insecurity Iâve got about my physical abilities.  I was watching a  urlLink movie  the other day, some kind of adventure flick involving mountain climbers, harrowing rescues and daring jumps from cliffs. It started off with the happy climbers singing and playing silly word games. Of course the camera zooms back to show the audience that the happy climbers are clinging to a sheer cliff, completely unconcerned by the dizzying depths below them. âWowâ I thought, âtheyâre so brave to be doing that.â  But are they? Or are they just doing something that comes naturally to them? I canât imagine being roped to a sheer cliff, hundreds of feet above the ground, and not being completely immobilized with fear. My friend canât imagine standing in front of a room of people without being tongue-tied with terror.  This all relates to one of my frustrations as I struggle to overcome my resistance to exercise. Damn it, Iâve got the desire, Iâm reasonably well proportioned, I know the exercises to do, the foods to eat and the goals I want to reach. So why is it still such a daily struggle for me to pick up some damn weights and exercise for forty-five minutes? Why would I rather sit on the couch and read a book instead of going for an invigorating run? I read books that inspire me to continue with the struggle, but it seems to get harder, not easier. Does  urlLink Steve Ilg  wake up in the mornings and think heâd rather do just about anything than hop on his bike for a four hour ride? No â he loves riding his bike. Give him several hours of free time, and heâll be outside. Give me several hours of free time and Iâll look for a great new book to read. Thatâs not a bad thing, but when it comes right down to it, his passions make his body healthy and strong, mine encourage sedentary habits and weak muscles. It just doesnât take much physical effort to turn a page.  Iâd gladly trade my ability to speak in public, my love of reading and my appreciation for a hamburger and fries for the burning desire to exercise hard every day. Since this desire doesnât seem to come to me naturally, is it possible to develop it? Iâm thirty-seven years old, damn it, and Iâve been obsessed with building a great physique since I was at least sixteen years old. Twenty-one years later Iâm still struggling with extra weight and what feels like chronic laziness. Is there some way to work with my personality instead of struggling to change it?  My desire to be fit has come to represent to me all of the dreams Iâve had and never achieved. Itâs something perfectly possible that at the same time seems incredibly impossible. Intellectually I know that if I exercise and eat right, my body will respond. My inner self believes something different â the Monkey Mind whispers that no matter how hard I work, Iâll never overcome my propensity to overeat and my resistance to regular exercise. Until it becomes a joy, how can I expect it to be a regular part of my life?  I started this journal because I was inspired by the book  urlLink Total Body Transformation  and wanted to see if adding a spiritual component to my search for fitness would prove to be the missing piece. It may still be, but I wasnât expecting my own resistance to the spiritual. Iâve grown a hard shell of cynicism and defensiveness in response to my fundamentalist Christian upbringing. The warrior in me longs for God, the Monkey Mind screams out arguments proving that there is no god.  Regardless, thinking about all of this has underscored one thing: I continue to struggle with both the physical and spiritual aspects of my life, but I havenât given up. I may stop exercising for a month or two at a time, I may not push myself particularly hard for several workouts in a row, I often still eat much more than my body needs â but damn it, Iâm going to keep working at this and Iâm going to make it happen.
