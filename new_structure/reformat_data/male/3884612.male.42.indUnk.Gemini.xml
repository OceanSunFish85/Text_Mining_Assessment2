        Returning to Napâs cottage Dave succumbed to the tiredness that had crept upon him since he first arrived in Slumber Forest. He wasnât used to running away from ravenous beasts or hiding from blood-sucking milkmen, and as far as he was concerned he wasnât even up yet. Conceding defeat, he had asked Nap if it was possible for him to rest awhile and Nap, extending his generosity even further, directed Dave to his bedroom while he busied himself about the garden.    Napâs bedroom was the most aptly named room Dave had ever see as all it contained was a bed. No bedside table or wardrobe or chest of drawers. Nothing but a small and well-made bed. Dave threw back the loose fitting over blanket and prepared to slip under the covers.    âOi ! What dâyou think youâre playing at ?â someone shouted.    Dave spun around, convinced that someone else must have entered the room after him, but there was no-one in sight. Feeling somewhat bemused, and a little angry, Dave nonetheless responded to the demand.    âWhere are you ? I canât see you ?â he asked of no-one in particular.    âJust because you canât see me it doesnât give you the right to climb into bed with me. I mean, we havenât even been introduced yet.â    Again, Dave looked hard to find the owner of the voice, but this time he directed his search towards the bed. Yet again, Dave failed to see the questioner.    âLook, Iâm sorry if Iâve done anything to upset you, but Iâve had a trying day and I canât see you and I really just want to get my head down for an hour or so. So, if you donât mind, can you just show yourself and stop all this hide and seek nonsense ?â    âOh itâs nonsense now is it ?â said the voice, now sounding even more irked. âHow would you like it if someone just strolled into your bedroom and climbed into your bed - while you were having a nap ? Bet you wouldnât just say âOn you go mate, help yourselfâ and fetch them a glass of milk. Or maybe you would ? Maybe where you come from bed raiding happens all the time ? I mean looking at you, youâre obviously not from around here so who knows what passes for manners where you come from.â    Dave had now had enough and demanded that the irked voice assign itself to a visible entity.    âIâm not carrying on this argument until you show yourself ! Iâve had just about enough for one day and Iâm not in the mood to play any more stupid gamesâ he barked.    âOoo, touchy. OK then, seeing as youâre obviously a bit deficient in the eyesight department maybe thisâll help ?â    Suddenly Dave was thrown back against the door and the air from his lungs was expelled into what was left of the room as it either contracted in size or was filled by something which was rapidly expanding like an inflating balloon in a cardboard box. It turned out to be closer to the latter explanation when Dave managed to recover his breath and squint around.    âI think I preferred it when you were invisibleâ he managed to mutter.    âI told you already. I wasnât invisible, you just couldnât see me.â    âSame difference. I still canât see youâ replied Dave as he tried to prise himself from the wall and squeeze himself into some space nearer the floor.   âThereâs just no pleasing some people. How about this then ?â    And Dave felt fell on his face, spread-eagled upon the floor like...a spread eagle, only with trousers and without wings. Or a beak. Or talons. Eventually, Dave raised his head enough to find a pair of feet inches from his nose. His eyes continued to travel upwards and he could see that the feet were attached to a pair of short, stubby legs. Raising himself up by his hands, Dave clambered to his feet and at last came face to face with his tormentor.    âHi. Iâm Til. Whatâs your name ?â    Dave took a second or two to look Til up and down. It didnât take that long as Til was only around 4 feet tall. Dave noticed that the clothes Til was wearing were an exact match for his own.    âIâm Dave. Snapâ said Dave.    âDavesnap ? Nice nameâ replied Til.    âNo, itâs just Dave.â    âSo why did you just say it was Davesnap then ?â    âI didnât. My nameâs Dave - just Dave. When I said Snap I meant we were wearing the same clothes ?â explained Dave.    âNo weâre notâ insisted Til.    âYes we areâ disagreed Dave. âLookâ and he displayed his shirt and trousers and boots to Til to emphasise his point.    âTheyâre not the same clothes. Theyâre similarâ said Til.    âWell obviously theyâre not the same clothes. You know what I meant thoughâ said Dave almost sarcastically, if it was possible to be almost sarcastic. If there are different levels of sarcasm then this was a 1.7 on the Cleverdick Scale.    âYou should never assume that you know what someone else is thinking. Unless youâre a mind-reader of course. Iâm guessing here, but I donât think youâre a mind-readerâ said Til with an assured air which Dave found slightly annoying. âI mean, where would we be if everyone assumed they knew what everyone else was thinking ? Thereâd be no need for words or gestures or communication. You wouldnât be able to have random thoughts, or wish bad luck on someone whoâd just bought the last of your favourite cakes from the shop, or...â    âI get the pointâ interjected Dave. âYouâre wearing similar clothes to mine. Not the same. Happy now ?â    âModerately. Itâd take more than a simple agreement on the true meanings of words to boost my satisfaction quotient Iâm afraid.â    Dave raised his right hand to his brow and shook his head.    âUnbelievableâ he muttered under his breath. âLookâ he said, âcan we just forget the last little exchange and start again ?â    âIf only that were possibleâ started Til, until he spotted Dave glaring at him. âOKâ he agreed suddenly.    Relieved to be back on something akin to a level footing, Dave attempted to start again.    âSo, how come I couldnât see you before ?â he asked.    âI was sleepingâ replied Til matter-of-factly.    âYou were sleepingâ repeated Dave. âAnd how is that supposed to answer my question ?â    âWell, when Iâm having a nap or a snooze or whatever itâs to conserve my energy and the best way to do that is to make myself as small as possible so I change into something like an insect or a mouse before I get under the coversâ explained Til.    âYou can do that ?â Dave said incredulously.    âI just told you didnât I ?â    Dave was rapidly realising that Til was very pedantic about the use, or misuse, of words.    âAnyway, as I was saying. When Iâm sleeping Iâm really small and I was under the covers so thatâs why you couldnât see me. I wasnât invisible - you just werenât looking hard enough. Then, when you got a bit angry I made myself a bit bigger.ââA bit bigger ? You can see that againâ Dave said.    âWhy ?â asked Til.    âForget it. I didnât mean itâ and Dave made a mental note to be more careful in future.  âSoâ continued Dave, âhave you always been able to make yourself smaller and  bigger - or did someone teach you ?â    Til looked at Dave with an expression that made Dave think he was the stupidest man alive. Perhaps he was - at least in Tilâs eyes anyway.    âNoâ replied Til, very slowly and carefully as though he was speaking to the stupidest man in the world, âwe can all do it. Itâs a natural thing, just like the way some folk can wiggle their ears, and otherâs can make themselves invisible. Iâm sure even someone like you has a....talent.â    The long pause before Til settled on the word `talentâ only served to emphasise Daveâs discomfort. He felt just like someone who had been offered a seat next to a man in a turban only to discover that the kind-hearted gentleman was a fakir and the `seatâ consisted of several dozen closely grouped six-inch nails.    âWell no-one I know can do itâ was the best Dave could come up with at short notice. To be truthful, even if Dave had been given several weeks notice of Tilâs question he would have been hard-pushed to come up with anything better. âWhen you said âweâ, does that mean Nap can do it too ?â    âNap ? Of course he canâtâ guffawed Til, making absolutely no attempt to rein in how laughable he found Daveâs question.    âI only askedâ mumbled Dave.    âSorryâ said Til as he wiped a tear from his eye, âbest laugh Iâve had in ages.â    âOh goodâ said Dave defiantly folding his arms across his chest, âIâm so glad to have brought some joy into your world. Now, if you donât mind, Iâd like to get some rest before we set off for Lottieâs house.â    Til suddenly lost his sense of humour. It was so lost that even the most experienced pot-holer rescue team would be unable to locate it, so far had it sunk beneath the surface.    âNot Mad Lottie ?â Til asked apprehensively.    âI prefer to call her Lottie myself but yes, I believe thatâs the woman in question.â    âBut why would anyone in their right mind want to go and see that crazy old bird ?â  Til uttered the words and then looked at Dave and Dave looked at Til and didnât like the way he was now looking at him. Til appeared to have an answer to Daveâs question - an answer that Dave felt would show him in a very poor light. A light so poor that lump of coal covered in dust and trampled beneath the dust of a cellar would  be more illuminating.

      General Philidemus Store was a squat, square man of indeterminate age and  imprecise intelligence on most things but, if you needed something you werenât quite sure of to fix that little job youâd put off for months, or a replacement button for an unusual jacket, or a kitchen utensil vital for the preparation of an exotic dish (and the spices or herbs indispensable to the recipe), or a dozen flat-head screws of uncommon length, then Philidemus was the man who could help.  Most days, Philidemus spent cataloguing his stock and clearing shelf space for new items to be added to his stock. Occasionally, a customer would wander into his store and he would put down his pencil and pad and listen while the customer related a tale of woe regarding a lost item, or a broken memento before asking, hopefully, if he could assist them. Usually, Philidemus would disappear into the back of the store and the customer would hear general scraping, shifting and rummaging noises before Philidemus returned proudly clutching the answers to the customerâs prayers.  On very rare occasions, when Philidemus had been unsuccessful in his search, he had nevertheless reassured the customer that the vital item was on `temporarilyâ out of stock but would arrive in `2 or 3 daysâ and 2 or 3 days later the customer would receive a note from Philidemus asking that they return to the store to collect their item.  Anything you wanted, of a general nature, General Philidemus Storeâs General Store was your Aladdinâs cave.  Nap and Dave arrived at the General Store a little after breakfast and Philidemus put down his pencil and pad in readiness for their order.  âNap, good to see you again. How goes it ?â asked Philidemus.  âWell, Philidemus. And you ?â replied Nap.  âOh, canât complain Nap. Still trying to complete the stock inventory. One day, one dayâ and Philidemus drifted off for a moment as he tried to imagine what it would be like to finally complete the inventory of his stock. âAnyway,â he suddenly asked âwhat can I do for you today ?â  âPhilidemus, Iâd like you to meet Dave. He needs your help.â  Dave wasnât completely happy with the way Nap had phrased his last sentence, but he put his feelings aside and stretched out his hand.  âPleased to meet youâ said Dave.  Nap and Philidemus both stared at Daveâs hand, then at each other, then back at Daveâs hand before Philidemus gingerly stuck out his index finger and prodded Daveâs palm before quickly withdrawing it again. Now it was Daveâs turn to look confused.  âWhat was that ?â asked Dave in a voice that was just below a demand.  âWhat was what ?â replied Philidemus in a voice just below understanding.  âThat...â Dave struggled to come up with the right word and decided upon âpoke. What was that for ?â  âYou started itâ said Philidemus a touch indignantly.   âI started it ?â Dave responded incredulously.  âGlad you agreeâ interrupted Nap, sensing the opportunity to bring the situation back to some level of control and reason. A cold stare in Daveâs direction let him know that he should just accept that the matter was closed and that it was time to move on to more important matters.  Nap turned to Philidemus. âDaveâs a stranger round these parts and is looking for something a bit more in keeping with our manner of dress. Would you have anything in his size ?â  Philidemus appeared to be concerned with the tip of his index finger and was examining it in minute detail, much to Daveâs annoyance.  âHmm ?â he hummed in reply.  âSome clothes ?â repeated Nap. âIn his size ?â  âOh, yes. Of courseâ answered Philidemus but Dave noticed that he still appeared to have a worry over his finger as he was now surreptitiously wiping it on the side of his trouser leg. âSomething in his size ?â wondered Philidemus. âShould have something through the back. Give me a momentâ and Philidemus disappeared into the back of the shop and left Dave and Nap listening to the scraping, scratching and rummaging sounds in his absence.  âSo, are you going to tell me what that was all about ?â demanded Dave.  âAll about what ?â asked Nap.  âDonât you startâ insisted Dave. âYou know fine well what I mean. I try to be friendly and your pal there gets all weird with me.â  âOh I seeâ answered Nap. âWhere you come from that was being friendly.â  âYeah. What did you think I was doing ?â  âWell, to tell you the truth, we didnât know what you were doing. Weâd never seen anyone do that before. I think Philidemus thought you wanted to look at your hand.â  âLook at my hand ?â Dave was bewildered. âWhy would I want him to look at my hand ?â  âThatâs what we wondered too. Thatâs why Philidemus was a bit wary.â  âA bit wary ?â repeated Dave. âIt was only a handshake for goodness sake. What do you folk round here do when you meet strangers ?â  Nap thought for a moment or two before replying. âUm, say âHelloâ?â was his best answer.  Not for the first time Dave felt completely out of his depth and wished he was somewhere else, anywhere but here. Wherever `hereâ was.  âRight, Iâve managed to find a few bits and pieces that might do.â Philidemus had returned from the back of the store and was carrying a large bundle of what appeared to be rags and cast-offs. Thatâs what it seemed to Dave anyway.  Nap obviously had a completely different impression. âWell done Philidemus. I knew you wouldnât let me down.â  âTake a lot more than a request for some over-sized clothes to stump me Napâ said Philidemus as he unloaded the bundle of rags/clothes onto the counter. âAnything catch your fancy ?â  Dave very much doubted if anything in the store would catch his fancy, but he proceeded to rummage through the bundle with at least some pretence of interest. The fact was, Dave had very little choice other than to find something from the pile of clothes, or continue to wander the village in his pyjamas. Eventually, Dave settled on a loose fitting pale green shirt of cotton-like material, a pair of heavy brown trousers that needed a severe turning up at the bottom (âused to belong to Big Brennâ Philidemus advised), a pair of thick black socks and a woven jacket of indeterminate material and unsure ownership.  âPerfectâ declared Philidemus.  Dave assumed that Philidemus had perfected the tailorâs trick of convincing every customer that any item of clothing, regardless of colour, size or material was just perfect for the wearer. Dave felt anything but perfect. In fact, he felt little more than adequate if the truth be told, but it was difficult to determine whether that was due to his current situation or the ill-fitting clothes. Dave assumed that a response was expected from him but the best he could muster was a muffled âHmmmâ.  Philidemus continued prowling around Dave like an eagle circling its prey. He looked Dave up and down, nodded a few times, stroked his chin a few times more and made the odd adjustment here and there, none of which appeared to make any difference as far as Dave could see.  âSo, what dâyou think ?â asked Nap.  âWell, itâs not my usual style - or colourâ began Dave. âBut itâll do for now. Anything would be an improvement on my pyjamas.â  Nod and Philidemus both silently nodded in agreement.  âHow much do we owe you then Philidemus ?â enquired Nap.  âLet me see nowâ Philidemus replied before muttering away to himself. Eventually the muttering stopped and Philidemus proudly declared âThat will be 27 shillings all in. A bargain in anyoneâs language.â  âNap agreed. âVery reasonable Philidemus.â  âBut I donât have any moneyâ said Dave sheepishly.  âPay me back laterâ answered Nap as he delved into what appeared to be a leather pouch and placed some coins onto the counter. At least Dave assumed they were coins but when he looked closer they appeared to be more like flattened wooden draught pieces, only instead of being black or white, these were various colours and Dave reasoned that the colours related to the value of the pieces as they all seemed to be the same size.  âBut I might never have the money to pay you back. And besides, Iâm not planning on staying around remember.â Dave didnât want to appear ungrateful but he was conscious of the fact that his main goal was to return home as quickly as possibly and, short of theft, he couldnât see any way that he would be able to accumulate the necessary cash to repay Nod.  Nap didnât appear to be concerned about this possibility though. âDonât worry. Iâm not in any hurry. Come on letâs go. See you later Philidemus.â  âAlways a pleasure Napâ said Philidemus as Nap and Dave strode out of his store.  âUmm, thanksâ mumbled Dave, still embarrassed at the fact that he now owed Nap hard cash as well as his life.  Suitably attired (well, almost) Dave and Nap strolled back towards the cottage.

      The way out of Slumber Forest appeared to be a random series of turns as far as Dave could tell. There was no indication of a path through the trees and bushes, but Nap seemed to know the way. It was as if he had an in-built radar that was guiding him toward the forest edge. Dave tried to keep pace with Nap as best he could but his usual exercise consisted of pulling apart the wings on a milk carton or carrying his trash out for the bin men. Occasionally Dave would have to run a few yards to catch a bus or train, but that would always leave him gasping for breath once heâd secured a seat. Yomping through some forest like a trainee orienteer would never make it onto one of his wish lists. In fact it probably wouldnât make it on to anyoneâs wish list - well anyone with half a brain anyway.  Luckily for Dave, he had a brain that completely filled the inside of his skull and at this moment it was beating out a rhythm just behind his eyes. A throbbing, dull pain like a drummer in a jazz band, only this kept better time.  âHow...much...fu..rther..?â gasped Dave gulping down air as if he was about to go under for the third time.  âJust a few more boundings.â replied Nap, âNot far now.â  âOh..good.â Dave answered. âDonât..think I...can put up...with much...moreâ  A good few boundings later and Dave could see that the forest was beginning to thin out and more of the night sky was visible above his head. It was starting to get a bit lighter as well and Dave guessed that dawn must be on its way soon. Eventually the forest gave way to sporadic clumps of foliage and Dave stopped and leant against a tree to recover.  âLooks like itâll be light soonâ said Dave.  âYip. Better get a move on before it gets too bright.â said Nap. There was a hint of danger in Napâs voice. A hint that Dave didnât like.  âIs there a problem then ?â Dave asked, trying his best to sound casual.  âNot if we get back to the village in time.â  âAnd if we donât ?â Dave was sounding a bit less casual now.  âProbably best you donât know.â replied Nap. âCome on. Not far nowâ, and off went Nap again. Dave could only marvel at Napâs seemingly boundless energy. Personally he felt as if heâd been turned inside out and hung out on a washing line on a particularly blustery day. His stomach was aching and he imagined that this must be what an egg feels like after 3 minutes in boiling water.  âI really would like to know what the big rush is you knowâ called Dave into the distance. âI mean what could be worse than that foot thing back there ?.  It was one of those moments when you realise that there are some things best left unsaid. Dave wished that he could somehow reverse time and wind it back to yesterday. No scary forest, no Giant Proudfoot, no gasping for air running after a strange man in a strange land. But time doesnât give a fig for feelings. It just plods on regardless, second by second by second towards, well the next second.  Nap stopped his bounding and waited for Dave to catch up. He didnât want to shout out an answer for fear of being heard. It wasnât quite light enough but the danger was close - and getting closer by the second.  âWell then ?â enquired Dave, âYou going to let me in on the big secret ?â  Nap looked around to check the coast was clear but as they were well inland it was a wasted exercise. Through gritted teeth Nap hissed one word in response to Daveâs enquiry. âMilkmenâ, and resumed his impression of a meerkat (but not as cute).  âWhat ?â spluttered Dave trying his best to keep himself from laughing out loud. âWeâre running like frightened deer to get to your house before your milk gets delivered ? You must be bonkers mate.â  âShhhhh theyâll hear youâ hissed Nap.  âOh right, theyâll hear me. And then what ? You only get silver top then ?â Dave was finding it difficult to take Naps behaviour seriously but Nap continued to keep a watchful eye on the surrounding area.  âWhatâs silver top then?. Some sort of disease ?â enquired Nap.  âItâs milk man milk. You know, the foil bit on the bottle ?â  âNope, got me there Iâm afraidâ replied Nap. He was still grimly peering into the distance and looking up at the sky, trying to judge whether they had enough time to make it home. âYou donât seem very worried about our situation.â âWorried ? What about ? A runaway milk float maybe.â Daveâs lack of concern was flagrant and nonchalant. It was as if he was finally relaxing and treating the whole episode as a pleasant interlude in a hectic day.  Nap was thrown by Daveâs attitude but he got up smartly and brushed himself down. âFloating milk you say ?â mused Nap, âHow does that work then ?â  Daveâs interlude was coming to a close and the walls of everyday life, with the attendant uneasiness they brought to bear, were closing in again. He looked and felt exhausted and he was seriously fed-up - again. Before Dave had the chance to explain that milk was about as likely to float as an elephant with a very large kite Nap was off again.  âIf we donât get back to the house in the next 10 minutes then weâre finished. The milkmen donât mess about you know, especially when thereâs fresh supplies to be had.â  Dave was sure what word was worse. Fresh implied something new and as he didnât have a clue where he was he assumed âFreshâ meant âMeâ. Supplies on the other had could be anything at all but Dave decided that, in the context of Napâs phrasing it meant âMe again.â Which was a worry. Quite a big one really.  âLook whatâs the story here ?â. Dave was agitated now, as well as exhausted and confused. Nonchalant and casual were no longer in his lexicon of common expressions. âYou keep going on about milkmen as if they were a marauding gang or something.â  Nap looked pleased at last (another worry for Dave). âNow weâre getting somewhere. Starting to understand now ?â  âNo Iâm bloody well not !â. Anger and frustration had now found a cosy place beside exhausted and confused. And worried, which had almost a whole page to itself. âStop talking in riddles and just...â  A loud cra-a-akk filled the air like a hundred Christmas crackers being pulled at once (expensive ones judging by the noise).  âDamn, theyâre earlyâ shouted Nap as he dropped to the ground dragging Dave with him. âStay still and donât make a sound. If weâre very, very lucky they might not spot us.â  Dave lifted his face from the dew-stained grass, gave his eyes a wipe and peered into the distance. The sun wasnât yet up but it had certainly made its mind up and the first shafts of light were just starting to pierce the sky.  âI canât see anyoneâ said Dave. âAre you sure thereâs someone out there ?â  âShhhhhhhhhhâ hissed Nap.  Dave made a stab at shhhhhhhh-ing even though he couldnât see what Nap was getting all worked up about.  Then he did and wished he didnât.  About 200 metres ahead the foliage folded back like an origami model and into the glistening daylight stepped a milkman. Dave recognised him as a milkman because he had the milkmanâs hat and apron on, but apart from those tell-tale signs everything else about the milkman said `Bewareâ. Instead of the standard issue milk bottle holder the milkman carried a what appeared to be a large plunger with a sharp syringe-like point in the centre. This was linked by a twisting tube to a canister on his back. In his right hand was a large, gleaming whip and Dave guessed that this was the source of the loud craa-a-ak that had interrupted his most recent rant.  The milkman was prowling like a panther - a panther that liked milk - and every so often he would stop and peer down at the grass or sniff the air.  âWhatâs he doing ?â whispered Dave, who was fed up with shhhhh-ing.  Nap glared at Dave and he returned to shhhhhh mode.  The sun was now rising rapidly and Dave was now able to see properly for the first time. He hadnât noticed before that the grass beneath him wasnât the expected green, but was more of a dull puce colour with a tinge of grey. The trees were the usual brownish colour but the leaves were speckled grey and red. It was as if God had been colour blind when he created this world. Either that or He had a rush job on and had sub-contracted the artwork to someone else - probably someone with their eye on a more valuable task like animal design or the human reproductive system.  The milkman continued prowling and staring and sniffing. Nap remained motionless and silent. Dave continued to shhhhhhh.  Eventually, the milkman moved off back into the foliage and disappeared but Nap motioned to Dave to remain still before finally rising to his feet some 5 minutes later.  âCanât be too careful. Theyâre devious creatures those milkmenâ said Nap.  âWell I have to say Iâve never ever seen a milkman like that. What was he looking  for ?â asked Dave.  âTold you,â replied Nap, âFresh supplies. They come out every morning in the hope of finding some wayward traveller like you so they can top up their stock.â  âWell theyâd be wasting their time with me. I donât have any milk on me.â Dave looked slightly triumphant at this but he should have known better.  âNot on you noâ said Nap. âBut in you, thatâs another matter.â  âIn me ?â Dave now looked bemused âWhat do you mean in me ?â  âSimple enough language isnât it ? Didnât you finish school?â Nap appeared to be tiring of his role as Daveâs educator and was looking forward to adopting a less challenging role. âMilkmen donât take milk so much as suck it out of you with their sappers.â  âThat plunger thing with the spike you mean ? But milk from where ? Do I look like a cow to you ?â  âWhatâs a cow got to do with anything ? Itâs milk theyâre after not jam. And as for you not having any, thatâs a laugh. You wouldnât be standing there talking to me if you didnât have milk pumping through you.â  Dave paused for a moment to let Napâs latest item of information sink in. âWhat colour is this milk ?â Dave asked. He felt like a prisoner asking the firing squad if the bullets would hurt.  âRed of course. What colour did you think ?â  Daveâs face was now doing a fair impression of a bottle of milk (white) as the colour (red) drained from his face.  âSeen milkmen drain a body of all itâs milk in the blink of an eye.â Nap didnât notice that Dave had stopped paying attention. âLove their milk they do and theyâll do anything to get their hands on fresh supplies. Youâve got to respect their tenacity and their versatility with it. They make some lovely cream with those whips you know. Not that I touch it myself you understand. Got to keep an eye on the old figure you know.â Nap patted his slightly padded stomach. âYou OK ? You look a bit pale.â  âRedâ said Dave âMilk. Red. Milk.â It seemed that Dave was searching for inner peace by chanting a mantra which consisted solely of the words Red and Milk.  âAnyways. Should be safe to make a move for now. Come onâ and off trotted Nap in the direction of home.  Dave was still transfixed on the latest information Nap had casually thrown at him and Napâs change of mood hadnât sunk in yet. It was floating around like a piece of bread on the ocean waiting to be plucked by a passing fish and devoured. Dave was making a fair impression of a fish himself with his lips opening and closing and opening again. There was a hint of dislocation about him too, as if he wasnât really all there or the grass beneath his feat and the sky above his head were just figments of his imagination.  It felt like several minutes had passed before Dave realised that Nap was getting smaller and fainter. In reality (which was somewhere Dave had become really fond of lately) it was only a few seconds and, like an obedient (and large) dog, he set off after Nap.   ***   ***   ***  The village of Witsend lay at the foot of a range of hills known as The Big Hills. The Big Hills had been discovered many years ago by an explorer who had become famous for his discoveries - but not for his naming skills. Eldred the Explorer had discovered the Lost Tribe Of Tribesmen, The Sea Of Waves and the Rocky Mountains in his time and felt that his duty was only to explore and discover new places and not bother too much with giving them fancy names. Say what you see was his motto and he stuck to it like a spoon to treacle.  Witsend wasnât discovered by Eldred the Explorer, mainly because it didnât exist when he was around. The village of Witsend was founded by a travelling band of neurotics who, quite unexpectedly, decided to stop worrying about things like what would happen if the sky fell in, or the wind blew too hard, or the grass tasted like lime marmalade instead of coconut jam.  Arriving at their momentous decision to put aside their collective manias it was fitting that they chose to name their permanent home Witsend for they had finally arrived at the place they had always warned other people of.  Witsend had long ago ceased to be a home only for ex-neurotics . Now all sorts of unstable people lived there. Claustrophobic ramblers, miserly gamblers, extrovert hermits and humble ex-politicians had all found a home in Witsend - and Witsend welcomed them with open arms, like a sperm whale encountering a shoal of plankton (if whales had arms).  Life in Witsend was fairly normal (as normal as a village of ex-neurotics could be) and most of its inhabitants went about their business like people anywhere else. It had all the usual village-type amenities and attractions. The General Store (managed oddly enough by an ex-General named Philidemus Store) where most of the day-to-day goods were sold, a post office where, as well as fence posts and railings, you could buy stamps at varying prices ranging from a simple tap on the toes to a full-blown crunch with a wooden mallet (sometimes minor slaps would be in stock - but not for long) and the village inn where a large majority of the village decisions were made as it was the only building big enough to hold most of the population.  Witsend was also home to Nap and he and Dave made their way up what Dave presumed to be the main thoroughfare towards a small house behind the General Store. There was no-one else around and Dave felt slightly uneasy about this.  âWhere is everyone ?â he asked.  âStill in bed. Not safe to get up until the Milkmen have been.â  Dave was surprised at how easily he accepted this explanation and carried on following Nap as if everything was now fine.  As they approached the house, Dave noticed that there was a small garden with what seemed to be a vegetable plot ready for sowing. A simple brown fence bordering the property was in need of a fresh coat of paint, but the garden looked tidy enough and Dave felt slightly ashamed of his own ramshackle garden back home. Nap plucked a small key out from a pocket hidden somewhere beneath the fish and mushrooms that were still hanging from around his waist and opened the bright yellow door to his house.  âNice placeâ said Dave.  âItâs nothing special really. Just a place to call home.â  âAll the same, itâs a good bit tidier than mine.â  To be honest, a squat inhabited by litter louts would be tidier than Daveâs place but Nap wasnât to know that and took Daveâs compliment at face value. Nap threw some kindling into the fireplace and lit it as if by magic. It looked like magic to Dave anyway but no doubt lighting a gas fire by flicking a switch would appear magic to Nap. The flickering flames cast dancing shadows on the walls and Dave took the opportunity to look around the room.  Above the small, but sufficient, fireplace there was an ornate and overlarge wooden shelf on which sat what appeared to be several items of pottery. The still dim light didnât help Dave to recognise what they were but they appeared to be animals of some kind. Above the shelf there was a small round window through which Dave could see that the morning was still to fully arrive.  To the right of the fireplace there was a square shaped chair with a brown and pink mottled design. It was quite small but looked sturdy enough even though the arms were beginning to show evidence of age. At the side of the chair was a circular table, just big enough Dave thought for a plate and perhaps a mug. Over to the left against the wall there was a low slung basin with some doors on either side. Dave guessed that they were doors to cupboards but given his recent experiences he wouldnât be surprised to hear that they were actually portals to an alternative universe where sheep ruled over a woollen land and every pig had the right to bear arms.  The room was bare compared to his own back home, but it was probably cosy enough for Nap Dave thought. It certainly helped explain why it was so tidy. âSomething to eat ?â asked Nap.  âUm OK. Whatever youâre havingâll do me thanksâ replied Dave. âYouâll find some clothes in the closet through thereâ nodded Nap in a direction behind Dave.  âClothes ?â queried Dave.  âSorry. I didnât realise you were already dressed. My mistake.â  Dave suddenly realised that he was still `dressedâ in his pyjamas. Events had passed so quickly that Dave hadnât stopped to contemplate his situation. Now that he appeared to be safe and well his predicament hit him like a baseball bat between a flyâs eyes. A very thin baseball bat obviously.  âNo, youâre right. These arenât my usual clothes at allâ said Dave, trying hard not to look uneasy, but failing spectacularly. âJust one question though.â  âYes ?â asked Nap, bracing himself for another of Daveâs incredibly stupid questions. He wasnât disappointed.  âThese clothes, would they be yours by any chance ?â wondered Dave.  âOf course. Who do you think they belong to ? Itâs my house after all.â Nap saw an opportunity to put an end to any further useless questions from Dave. âIf you donât mind me saying so, youâve got a habit of asking questions with really obvious answers. Now, maybe thatâs the  way it is where you come from but folks round here tend to have a lot of things to do so only ask a question when they really donât have an answer.â  Dave felt a little disappointed that he was coming across as a simpleton to someone he regarded as little more than a living gnome. A gnome that had a nice house and garden and had been quite helpful so far but still, Dave thought he was superior intellectually and shouldnât really be standing there being told off like a pupil in a Maths class.  âIâm sorry you feel that wayâ was the best Dave could come up with at short notice, âbut youâre missing my point. If the clothes in the closet are yours, thenâ and Dave stepped across the room and stood facing Nap. Well he didnât exactly face Nap as Nap barely reached his chest. âYou see ?â  Realisation dawned across Napâs face. âAhhh, I see what you mean. Bit of a problem then. But you canât walk around the village dressed like that. Weâll need to see what Philidemus can do for you.â  âPhilidemus ?â  âHe owns the General Store. Bound to have something thatâll fit you. Anything you need, generally speaking, Philidemusâ your man.â  âGreat. Iâll feel better once Iâm properly dressedâ said Dave with more than a hint of hope in his voice. âListen, I donât mean to sound rude or ungrateful or anything but any chance of filling me in on whatâs happening ?  I mean I donât know where I am or how I got here or anything.â  Nap was busying himself at the basin putting together some ingredients for breakfast. âWhat do you want to know ? Iâll try my best to help but donât think Iâll be much use to you.â  âWell for a start could you tell me exactly where I am ?â  âYouâre in my house of course. You really donât have much of a memory do you ?â  âWell obviously I knew that. What I meant was where am I in general ?  You know, town, country that sort of thing ?â Dave tried not to sound exasperated but he felt so helpless and useless like a small child strapped into a carriage on a rollercoaster that was on a one-way trip to oblivion. On second thoughts a small child would probably think that was fun and fun was something Dave wished he knew right now.  âTold you that back in Slumber Forest and now youâre in Witsend. Canât say fairer than that can I ?â  Nap didnât mean to be unhelpful but there was only so much he knew and what he knew wasnât very helpful so far.  âYes I know thatâ replied Dave trying his best not to sound ungrateful âbut I havenât heard of any of the places you mentioned and you havenât heard of any of the places I know so you can see how Iâm still a bit confused.â Dave hoped that Nap understood his anxiety but doubted it.  âI think you mustâve had a bump on the head or something. I mean who in their right mind would go to sleep in the middle of Slumber Forest ? Thatâs asking for bother that is and no mistake.â  Nap didnât appear to be aware of his anxiety Dave thought. In fact he appeared to think he was a few cones short of a contra-flow. All the same, Nap had a point. If he couldnât explain where he was or how he got there how would Nap know ?  âBut I didnât go to sleep in the forestâ explained Dave.  âWell, you managed to fool me thenâ Nap responded a touch sarcastically.  âOK, OK. I realise that I might, and I stress might, appear a little, well, over-wrought but put yourself in my place. Iâm woken up to find myself in a strange place and told by a strange - no offence - man that if I donât get a move on Iâll be the main course on a mad creatures breakfast menu. How would you feel ?â  âDunno. Suppose Iâd make sure I didnât find myself in your place. I mean - no offence either- you donât seem to be the smartest of folk if you keep waking up in places youâve never been and talking to âstrangeâ folk.â  âBut I donât !â Dave was on his feet now and giving a good impression of someone almost at breaking point (wherever that might be). âThis has never ever EVER happened to me before. But of course, you donât believe that. You think Iâm some sort of madman who needs locking up.â  Dave thought he saw a faint smile play around Napâs lips but couldnât quite place the tune and carried on...  âIf you canât help me then maybe someone else around here can ?â  Nap wasnât trying to be unhelpful, but there isnât much anyone can do when faced by someone who appeared to have great difficulty in working out the most basic tasks. All Nap had managed to find out so far was what the crazy man called himself - and that was the stupidest name heâd heard since his Aunt Myrtle named her first child Moonbeam Obadiah Obladi.  âMaybe Mad Lottie could help ?â Nap offered. âShe knows some queer things she does.â  Dave was unimpressed. Someone with `Madâ in their name didnât fill him with confidence. In fact it only served to heighten his concern that Nap genuinely thought he was insane. Maybe he was ? Maybe he was really bouncing off the walls of a padded cell with bits of his tongue lying on the floor ? Maybe this was all a dream and heâd wake up in a minute to the sound of his alarm clock. No, that wouldnât happen because heâd broken the alarm clock yesterday morning. Was it really yesterday morning or was that a dream too ?  Maybe this was real and Trimble-on-the Moor was a dream ?  Daveâs head hurt.  Nap continued with his `helpfulâ advice oblivious of Daveâs confused state.  âCourse, she might not want to help someone like you - a stranger I meanâ.  âGreat. Very comforting to knowâ replied Dave, trying to ignore the full-scale battle going on inside his head between reason and irrationality (a no-score draw so far though illogicality had most of the possession). âSo, basically, what youâre telling me is that the one person who might be able to help me is called âMadâ and she might not want to help me because Iâm not from round here ?  If I was from round here then I wouldnât need her help in the first place would ?â  âSâpose not,â said Nap with a resigned air, âbut itâs the best I can do.â Donât have much call round here for help in explaining where folk come from. Most folk tend to know things like that anyway and what to know about where theyâre going and whatâs going to happen. Mad Lottieâs good at things like that they say. Never had much call for her myself you understand.â  âWell if thatâs the best thatâs on offer then I suppose Iâd better go and see what sheâs got to say.â  (Final score: Reason 0, Illogicality 1).

      It had been a productive night for Nap Greenling and now it was time to head back home before the last of the night faded into the harsh glare of day. The sky above was wavering between a bright orange with splashes of grey and a deep purple and a dawn mist was just beginning to form. Soon the stars would fade and the moon would disappear leaving the sky free for the sun.  Nap gathered together his collection of mushrooms and fish and placed them in his sack. The mushrooms had been particularly hungry today he thought and heâd been extremely lucky to find so many fish growing by the river bank. You didnât often find so many heads of cod and pike clumped together at this time of year. The River Soul was a well known breeding ground of the magic mushroom but they were usually wary of the more common types of bait that came to tempt them from above their watery ceiling.  Fresh parsley was a tempting treat to any mushroom, but when it was accompanied with the danger of being yanked from the cool comforting water onto a warm and grassy riverbank (often followed by a swift bash from a well sculpted piece of wood almost immediately after) all but the most naive or hungriest magic mushroom would turn away and look for something a little less perilous instead.  It was with judicious and wise reasoning that the magic mushroom continued to prosper while other, less careful fungi had diminished in number. Some almost to extinction. The simple (in more ways than one) Lesser Common Toadstool was once just the Common Toadstool but a nonchalant disregard for the most basic precautions coupled with an unhealthy and voracious appetite for sage and onion led to a gradual decline in its number. Of course, the fact that the toadstool family in general wasnât blessed with simple common sense (although they were common in almost every other sense of the word) didnât help its survival rates. Even a headless chicken has enough sense to keep running from danger.  The multitude of mushrooms and fish had been such that Nap had lost track of time and he really should have set off for home some time ago. Now he would be faced with a race against time - and time rarely lost these encounters. Nap pondered the choice before him, weighing up the possible dangers lurking in the forest, and the almost certain hazard that awaited should he fail to reach home in before light. It was a very short ponder (more a pond, but not as damp) and, throwing his sack over his shoulder, Nap made his way to the edge of Slumber Forest.  Slumber Forest had once straddled the land like a gargantuan green Sumo wrestler with a nappy that had room for a thousand nests but leaving only the very edges free for habitation but over time it had gradually been pushed back until now it merely stretched across almost from coast to coast like a verdant belt. The Sumo was now little more than a lightweight, and not a particularly good one either, but what Slumber Forest had lost in terms of size it made up for with its inhabitants.  Slumber Forest was home to a motley range of creatures. Everything from the vicious Sniping Shrew, which could reduce a man to a quivering shell with its biting sarcasm, to the Mammoth Sale which could use its amazing powers of deception to persuade people to trade all their possessions for some dried figs and some dubious bottles of perfume. Nap hoped that fortune would continue to look kindly upon him for the rest of the night and that all his luck hadnât been squandered on mushrooms and fish.  Carefully picking his way through the lower branches of the first few trees, Nap kept one eye out for any sign of a path through the forest. It was an unlikely thing to find in Slumber Forest but that didnât mean that he should give up hope of finding one. Strange noises filled the air and immediately became huge and savage beasts in Napâs mind.  Imagination, in the wrong hands, can be an awesome and terrible thing. What would have happened if Hannibal had decided to stay at home and keep his elephants for circus parades instead of taking them for a trek through the Alps ? Or if Hitler had decided to carry on painting houses instead of deciding âPoland ? Nice country - Iâll take it.â What passes as creativity in one person may hold untold terror for another. Horrible and foul-smelling creatures inhabit the deep recesses of the mind and prey on lesser thoughts like a leopard stalking a herd of wildebeest on the African plain - but without the leopards grace (or spots for that matter). Thereâs something to be said for people with no imagination. After all, how many of these unimaginative people wake up in a cold sweat from a bloody and brutal nightmare ?  The grass was beginning to thicken now and Napâs progress was visibly slower. It was as if he was wading through some particularly thick custard - a browny green colour of custard without the sweet and warm aroma of the custard you find in school canteens. Admittedly, the school custard might taste like something that was browny green but that was most likely due to the lack of culinary skills in most canteens rather than the actual ingredients.  The grass started to thicken, the sky began to lighten and Napâs pulse quickened. He was starting to wonder if this was such a good idea after all, but before he could ponder this question further he became distracted by a noise in the distance. Well it was more of a roar than a noise really and the distance wasnât as great as Nap wouldâve liked. A roar with a crunching crashing accompaniment that sounded like a badly tuned bulldozer that was out of control and thundering through a vast field of giant breadsticks.  Nap rummaged through his memory to place the roar, hoping that heâd find it to be some harmless noise - perhaps a hidden waterfall, or the sound of some creature snoring. Some creature that lived on fruit and wasnât at all carnivorous. A few seconds later his memory began jogging - and Nap started running to catch up with it.  The grass beneath his feet tried itâs best to slow him down but Nap still managed to keep a steady pace and never looked back once.  That was how Nap fell.  ***   ***   ***  âWake up. Come on wake up !â  âHnnnn. Whaassat ? Hmmmâ.  âDamn it, snap out of it or weâre done for. Come on, come on, come on !â  Dave suddenly sat bolt upright in his bed to find that he wasnât in bed at all. In fact he wasnât even in his bedroom at his cottage anymore. He couldnât see much as his eyes were still shrouded in sleep but from what he could see he was sitting on the ground, possibly grass or moss in what appeared to be a wood or a forest. He was still in his pyjamas and a cold wind was winding its way through the trees and bushes that surrounded him. Oh, and the ground was trembling as if shivering from the cold air that filled the moonlit night.  âAt last. Come on, we donât have much time.â  Dave turned his head to where the voice was coming from and came face to face with its owner.  âHmmmwhassat...?â  âHurry, run for it. Now !â  âWazzat.. ?â Dave was still in a semi-comatose state and wasnât ready to go anywhere. Not in a hurry anyway.  A sudden slap to his left cheek brought him back to life.  âWhat the... ? Who the hell are you ?â Dave demanded.  âNo time for that now. We need to reach safety before the Giant Proudfoot catches our scent. Quick, this way.â and off he/she/it went expecting Dave to follow.  âIâm not going anywhere until someone explains whatâs going onâ shouted Dave at a fast disappearing back. He folded his arms to emphasise the point and raised his voice another notch. âThis is just...â Dave hadnât finished his forlorn plea for information before a gut-wrenching bellow drowned out his insistent plea. The bellow was closely followed by the sound of splintering wood and just-demolished undergrowth and Dave quickly decided that the advice heâd been given to follow was actually quite sensible and off he scampered after the now almost out of sight back.  âWait. Slow down.â he gasped, vainly trying to make up the ground heâd lost on his assailant, but the louder Dave shouted the louder (and nearer ?) the bellowing became and the more the ground beneath him shook. Dave was sure that whatever the Giant Proudfoot was, it wouldnât be a master of small talk and he sure as hell wasnât prepared to hang around to prove his theory or to add flesh and bone to the bellowing and splintering that seemed to surround him.  âQuick, down here.â  Dave looked around trying to locate the source of the advice.  âDown here at your feetâ  Dave peered downwards and could just make out the rough outline of someone almost hidden down what appeared to be a hole in the undergrowth.  âHurry now, before it sees youâ   Suddenly something grabbed hold of his right ankle and pulled him to the ground and Dave was no longer wondering about his circumstances. The basic instinct of survival had taken over and, without questioning why or contemplating whether it was a good idea, he scrambled down into the hole with its existing occupant.  He/she/it put a finger (well Dave presumed it was a finger because his eyes hadnât adjusted to the half-light around him) to its lips (again, presumption came into play) and Dave lay there not daring to move or breathe or blink.  The ground was now almost bouncing around Dave and the noise from the Giant Proudfoot was pounding into his brain and bouncing around his head like a psychotic pinball machine, its silver ball ricocheting behind his eyes and heading for a record score. Suddenly everything stopped - including Daveâs heartbeat - and the forest fell silent. Dave had a subconscious and worrying need for his mother as he tried to keep a sense of composure but composure whilst being threatened by an unknown beast and hiding in an unknown forest during the hours of darkness was one of many lessons Dave had failed to learn in his time. It was up there with âHow to pick up girls without tryingâ and âSuccessful finance on a shoestringâ.  He was faintly aware of a slight breeze above his head. It was warm and pungent and seemed to change direction in a random fashion. He suddenly realised that what he thought was a breeze above his head was actually the slow in-out breathing of an animal. A very large animal. One capable of bellows and wood-splintering.   The Giant Proudfoot is aptly named. It is, as you can imagine, of some considerable size standing a full 12 feet high and weighing the equivalent of two medium sized elephants. As it moved around the ground would shake as if on deranged hydraulics and the reason for such terra-non-firma was clear to anyone who had ever seen a Giant Proudfoot. Instead of the customary two, four, six or eight legs, the Giant Proudfoot had one and what it lacked in number it more than made up with in size with a huge tree-like limb with four rock-sized toes and nails as sharp as a theatre criticâs tongue.  Imagine those two medium sized elephants tied together and lashed to a pogo stick. Now you would have some idea of how the Giant Proudfoot moved around and why everyone within a five mile radius was aware of its presence. A graceful and flighty mover it was not. Fortunately for Dave, and everyone else within hopping distance,  the Giant Proudfoot has very poor eyesight due to the fact that no optician has a big enough chart to test them on and its sense of smell was meagre and, at best, similar to an anglerâs sense of proportion.    For what seemed an eternity, but was probably less than a minute, Dave lay motionless in the dark and musty hole. Next to him, his co-prey remained silent and Dave could just see the faint glint of moonlight reflecting off its eyes as they flicked from side to side. It seemed to know what it was doing so Dave, ever so slightly (in fact so slightly that he didnât notice it himself) began to relax and allowed his body to step down from the red alert to a nice shade of orange instead.  Eventually the Giant Proudfoot concluded that its prey had escaped, and with a mighty hop crashed its way back into what remained of the forest.  Dave slowly stood up and tried to speak but his brain was having problems forming anything that resembled a word. Instead, Dave gave a low grunt followed by some choking noises. He clasped his hands around his throat as if to squeeze out the words that he knew were inside but only managed to increase his choking further. Fortunately for Dave help was at hand in the form of his co-prey who administered an almighty slap to his back that threw him back to the floor.  âThanks. I thinkâ he managed to wheeze between gasps for air.  âNo problem. Glad to helpâ replied the slapper.  âWho are you anyway - and where am I ?â Dave had a feeling he wasnât going to like the answer, but now that heâd asked the question he was prepared to face the consequences.  âMy nameâs Nap. Pleased to meet you.â said Nap, who seemed unusually cheerful for someone who had almost become breakfast.  Dave took a moment to look the stranger up and down. It didnât take long. Nap stood around 4 feet tall with a mass of ginger hair bursting out of a round and ruddy face. Dave thought his head looked like a burst sofa, but he was too polite (and shaken) to say so. Besides, the man with a burst sofa for a face had just saved his life and it would be impolite to suggest he applied himself to some facial grooming.   Nap was dressed in what looked like a cat suit - well he was if there were any cats with purple and black fur. Around Napâs waist, and almost touching the ground, were some fish and mushrooms, plus a short but sharp looking knife.  âDave. Iâm Dave. Where is this ? What am I doing here - and how did I get here ?â  âSlow down there. I only just met you remember.â replied Nap. âAnd as for where you are, well youâre in the middle of Slumber Forest and I havenât a clue how you got here or what youâre doing here. Donât you know ?â Nap gave Dave a quizzical stare that implied that Dave must be a blithering idiot if he didnât know where he was or what he was doing. Where Nap came from people like Dave were laughed at by little children and had a tendency to fall down holes or walk into trees.  âWell of course I donât know ! I wouldnât be asking would I ?â Dave sounded indignant at what he thought was a stupid question, but immediately realised that wasnât the correct way to treat someone who had saved his life. âIâm sorry. Itâs just that the last thing I can remember was going to bed for the night. The next thing I know Iâm being chased by some Bigfoot creature...â  âGiant Proudfootâ corrected Nap.  âWhatever. The point is, I havenât a clue where I am or why.â  âTold you. Youâre in Slumber Forestâ replied Nap looking just a tiny bit smug with his arms folded across his chest  âThat means nothing to me. Iâve never heard of Slumber Forest. Is it one of those Theme Parks or something ?â Dave had so many questions bursting to come out of him he felt as if heâd swallowed a horse. âWhereâs the nearest town ?â  âThe nearest town ? Suppose thatâd be Dream Hollow `bout 5 winks to the Northâ Nap answered thoughtfully cupping his chin with one hand and stroking the back of his neck with the other.  âThis is getting worse. â Dave was slowly losing his will to live. âI havenât heard of any of those places. How far is it to London from here ? Thatâll give me some idea of where I am.â  âLun-dunâ mused Nap. âNo, donât think Iâve heard of that village. Whereâs that  then ?â  Dave could scarcely believe his ears. âYouâve never heard of London ? You must have. for Gods sake itâs the biggest city in the country. What school did you go to ?â  âSame as everyone else round here - Dream Academy. Best school around for miles. Come to think of it, itâs the only school for miles.â Nap didnât sound as if heâd taken offence at Daveâs tone but then heâd only just met him and for all he knew Dave always spoke as if he was in a hurry and everyone around him was hard of hearing. Why should he worry. He wasnât the one that was lost and asking stupid questions.  âI canât believe this. One minute Iâm fast asleep in my bed and the next thing I know Iâm having a conversation with someone Iâve never met, who saved me from a Giant Proudtooth...â  âFootâ corrected Nap.  â...in the middle of God knows where. This is madness, sheer and utter madness. None of this can possibly be real.â  Nap looked at Dave as if to agree that something was mad all right and the likeliest candidate was Dave. âMaybe seems queer to you, but itâs fine to me. You tryinâ to say that Giant Proudfoot was just a figurement of my imagination or summat ?â Nap wasnât helping Dave feel any better. âAnd anyways, how come you didnât just wish it away if it werenât real ? Wouldâve saved me a whole load of bother so it would.â  âBecause...â but Dave didnât know the answer and he just stood there, in his pyjamas, with his mouth gaping and giving a fair impression of a fish on a riverbank.  âFar as Iâm concerned, real is real and I know what I know and I know that beast were having us for its supper tonight if it could. You want to believe it never happened you go right ahead. Iâll just be on my way home now if you donât mind.â and with that, Nap turned away and stated to make his way home.  âNo, waitâ Dave shouted after Nap, âDonât leave me here alone. I donât know how to get home from here.â  âDonât know much do you ?â replied Nap. âAnyways, Iâm sure thingsâll be as right as the top of Old Spectre over there soon enough.â Nap casually waved his hand off to the right.  Dave followed the direction Nap was waving toward and could just make out the shadow of a mountain peak way off in the distance. The moonlight gave it an eerie depth as if it was just a black void sucking in the stars one by one and Dave was transfixed by it for a second or two before he came back to what remained of his senses.  âLook Iâm sorry I shouted at you and all that but Iâm just so confused. Iâm sure this is just a dream and Iâll wake up soon, but if itâs all the same to you Iâd like to tag along with you for a bit more. At least until we get out of this forest.â Dave was almost pleading now and Nap could see how pathetic Dave looked.  âNo more shouting ?â enquired Nap.  âPromiseâ replied Dave holding up his right hand. âIâll be as good as gold.â  âWhatâs wrong with your hand ?â   âNothingâ replied Dave in a slightly embarrassed tone as he wiped his hand on his pyjama bottoms for no particular reason.  âI suppose I could put up with you a bit longer. Come on.â and with that, Nap trotted off.

      Monday morning dawned like any other day over the village of Trimble on the Moor.  The sun rose at its usual seasonal time, the birds chattered and sang their usual chat and song and, at precisely 9 seconds past 6:00 AM, Dave Martinâs talking alarm clock bounced off his bedroom wall. All very normal, all very usual, all very, very ordinary. So ordinary in fact that you could say it was boring. Life is mostly boring although it can be punctured be all too fleeting moments of interest it soon settles down again into the same rut.  Dave Martin slowly brought all his bodily functions back on-line. Sight - slowly getting used to the brightness that comes free with every sun. Hearing - all present and correct and tuning in to the early morning birdsong. Touch - yes, itch successfully located and scratched. So, all was well with the world except for the talking alarm clock of course which was now having some sort of electronic epileptic fit on Daveâs bedroom carpet.  15 minutes later, having completed his mental checklist, Dave decided that it was time to get up and he made his way, slowly and predictably, to the bathroom. A quick splash of water, a casual play around the worst excesses of stubble with his electric razor, a ruffle of his remaining hair and a burst of anti-perspirant under each armpit later it was back to the bedroom to get dressed.  After the briefest of pauses, so brief that it hardly merits 6 letters, Dave plumped for a plain white shirt and rummaged around the pile of clothes at the bottom of his wardrobe until he came up trumps with a sober dark blue tie. Perfect. Now for breakfast.  Daveâs kitchen was a strange affair. It was more a collection of pots, pans, assorted crockery (of varying designs), various items of cutlery (some embossed âProperty of Crown Hotels plc), empty food packets, half empty food packets, a very small number of full food packets, an old fashioned china basin with brass taps, an antique-looking Welsh Dresser (which Dave, displaying a rare sense of humour, had christened Tom Jones), an American-style (and therefore out of place in Daveâs kitchen) larder fridge (almost empty) and a rickety pine table with matching straw chairs, than a proper kitchen. Proper kitchens had fitted cupboards, fancy double-bowl sink units and, most important of all, looked and smelled clean. Just like yours and mine, but mostly yours - probably.  Still not fully in touch with the world, Dave poured out a generous helping of cereal (storeâs own brand of course - well itâs cheaper than the real thing and heâd become strangely fond of the faint taste of mouldy cardboard and bath salts that passed for Frosted Flakes) into the one remaining bowl big enough to serve his purpose and dribbled the last few drops of milk from the bottle on top of the fridge over the flakes.  âFit for a Kingâ Dave thought to himself (one of the worldâs great thinkers is Dave. Unfortunately his genius remains unrecognised by every educational, scientific and military establishment throughout the land), before picking up a spoon and digging (yes, digging) into the mouldy cardboard/bath salts combination.  It was 6:45 AM by the time Dave had forced down the last Frosted Flake and, as there was no indication that his breakfast was preparing for a return trip, he decided that he would, after all, go to work this morning. His decision was as surprising as a dog deciding to fetch a stick, or a trucker opting for the full sausage-egg-bacon-black pudding-beans-chips-with-extra-sauce at the motorway cafe. Dave Martin was a persistent attendee at Royle Brothers Limited and he was proud of the fact that neither he nor any other employee at Royle Brothers  Limited could remember a day when he didnât turn up for work - except holidays of course, but even then Dave had to be forced out the door on his last day with strict instructions to âStay awayâ, âEnjoy yourselfâ, âYou need a break Dave !â  âA break ? Not meâ Dave would say as if the company would grind to a standstill because Dave Martin wasnât there to oil the wheels of industry.  After brushing his teeth and gargling for the recommended 60 seconds Dave set off for work. It was a short hop to the railway station, but Dave decided to walk as it was less strenuous and patiently waited for the 7:07 to Hulford West. The 7:07 arrived at 7:17, but there was nothing unusual with that. If it had actually arrived at the time printed on the timetable that would be unusual. A delay of 10 minutes was par for the course (which, logically speaking, would make an early arrival a birdie) and wouldnât cause Dave a problem in arriving for work at 8:57 AM precisely.  There was something different about the train this morning though, but Dave couldnât quite figure out what it was. It was just a feeling, a sense of the unusual that came into his mind, but not finding anything of any interest, quickly went off in search of somewhere else to linger. The 22 minute journey to Hulford West passed without incident - well, apart from the chicken, but thatâs another story for another time - and Dave arrived at the offices of Royle Brothers Limited at 8:57 AM and punched his timecard for the day. One set of bruised knuckles later Dave carried on through the heavy wooden doors and made his way to his desk.  Now, to most people a designer is a faintly glamorous profession conjuring up images of sequins and bows, chiffon and taffeta, reds, blues, blacks (this years black) and pastels, but âthereâs more to design than a bunch of fancy dan dressesâ as Dave would say - often. Dave designed bathroom âfurnitureâ. To be precise, WCs. Not just any WCs you understand, these were sculptures, an art form of the highest quality, something that your bottom could fall in love with given half the chance and a sentient existence. Look around you, right now (go on it wonât take long) and let your eyes flick from object to object. What do they all have in common ?  Design. Someone, somewhere, sometime came up with that state of the art light switch, that easy to use bottle opener, that foldaway clothes-horse - yes, even that âHonk if you think Iâm sexyâ car sticker. Incredible isnât it, but where would we be without designers ?  Just imagine a world that was fashioned without designers - no door handles, no sturdy shoes for those long country walks, no foot spas (for after those long country walks), no clothes. Honestly, itâs a better world with designers.  Daveâs current project (he always called his work a project as it made it sound grander than reality) was the Ironclad. An industrial strength WC for hospitals, and Indian restaurants the Ironclad had reinforced sidewalls, a quick release flush and an inbuilt freshener. The Ironclad was in its final design phase before being passed through to the workshop for building and testing. There had been a couple of tricky design issues to iron out, mostly concerning the length of delay between `pushâ and `flushâ and reducing the water flow to a torrent from the initial tidal wave effect which would have left any unfortunate user with an awkward explanation to fellow diners or patients. A small patch of moist material is a common hazard after a visit to the bathroom, but returning to the table or the bedside looking as if youâd waded through the sewer was another matter.  Fortunately, Dave was never stumped for long and what he didnât know about WC design you could write on one sheet of velvet tissue, if you were ever bored enough to try. With a few minor alterations the Ironclad, Daveâs latest masterpiece, would be complete and he would once again be flushed with success.  âWotcha Dave. Nice weekend ?â said Bob.  Bob designed baths. Not Jacuzziâs, steam baths, corner baths or showers, but plain, ordinary, simple, unadorned, not-ornate-in-the-slightest baths. Dave looked upon Bob as he imagined Zeus and all the other Greek Gods looked upon the Ancient Greeks, and like a chaos theory mathematician looks upon an abacus. Bob was to be pitied. Bob was to be consoled. Bob was to be gently patted on the head and sent out to play with the other boys and girls.  âOh the usual Bob. You knowâ replied Dave.  The âusualâ being his way of condensing âWent home on Friday after work, watched nothing of any interest on telly, went to bed, got up Saturday, bought some groceries and a paper, went home again, watched telly (again), made something for tea, threw it in the bin, ordered a takeaway, threw the remains in the bin, watched telly (still nothing interesting), went to bed, got up and disposed of contents of stomach down toilet (unfortunately there was no Ironclad to deal with the odour that hung around like paparazzi at a night-club), got up Sunday afternoon, bought the Sunday papers, read the Sunday papers, had a cheese sandwich for tea, fell asleep watching some rubbish on telly, woke up and went to bedâ into one simple throwaway phrase.  âI was down the old Pig  Poke Saturday nightâ Bob carried on, blissfully unaware that his social life was of no interest to Dave. âWhat a laugh. Terry, you know Terry, works in Accounts and ponces about with that Leanne. Well, Terry decides to get up for the karaoke and youâll never guess what happened......â.  By now, Daveâs brain had switched to autopilot and had switched on all the lights to signify that nobody was at home. The undoubted laughs to be had at the Pig  Poke public house on Karaoke Night would have to remain outwith his realm of reality.  â...and then - Christ this was a killer -Joe says to Terry.....â  Have you ever considered what it would be like to plan, execute and be successful with a perfect murder ?  One so brilliant in its conception that the finest minds at Scotland Yard would be completely baffled. Imagine the supreme satisfaction of knowing that, in all the world, only you had the intellectual capacity to pull off such an audacious crime.  Dave often had such a thought - but only on Monday mornings, and only while Bob was in full `laugh of the century` mode. Strange how you can work with someone 5 days a week without them having the slightest idea how you really felt about them.  â...well, as you can imagine. The whole pub was in uproar. So, Terry decides to...â  âGod, will he ever stop ???â thought Dave, his brain now switching on every 100 watt light bulb available. His brain was sending messages down to his hands and forcing them into a claw like arrangement. His blood was pumping through his veins like an Intercity 125 through the London Underground. He couldnât take much more of this. He wouldnât. It was impossible. He had to do something, anything to SHUT HIM UP.  Of course he didnât do anything.  Eventually, Bob reached the end of his tale and Daveâs brain sent a message to his mouth to respond.  âHilarious Bob. Where do you get them from ?â  âDunno Dave. Things just sort of happen when Iâm out. You should try it yourself.â  âOh, I donât know about thatâ. Daveâs brain was frantically backtracking in the dire hope that it hadnât manoeuvred itself into a cul-de-sac. âNot really my scene. Anyway, Iâll need to get the Ironclad finished off today. One or two tricky design issues to iron out.â  âDriving you round the bend is it ?â smirked Bob. âWell, the offerâs there mate. Just gives a shout if you fancy itâ.  Dave gave a tired smile (as opposed to a wide-awake one presumably) and returned to his work. âYeah. Will do. Anyway, back to the old grindstone eh ?â. Daveâs brain gave a subconscious sigh of relief and switched off all the lights.   ***   Monday drifted by as Mondays often do. The Ironclad design process progressed ponderously towards its conclusion and Bob prattled on about everything and nothing in particular. Eventually, Dave managed to turn the corner with the design faults and  soon it was time to pack up for the day and head back home. Dave carefully placed the almost complete Ironclad design back into his desk drawer and carefully locked it.  âGot anything planned for tonight then Dave ?â asked Bob, knowing full well that Dave never, ever, ever did.  âNope. Quiet night in.â  Dave so much wanted to say âAgainâ but he knew that Bob wasnât really interested in his mundane life so he let the opportunity pass.  âWell, Iâll be off down the pub then Dave. Sure I canât tempt you to a swift one ?â  âNo thanks Bob. Things to do at home, you knowâ lied Dave.  â OK then. See you tomorrowâ and with that Bob was off.  âYeah. Sure. Have a nice night.â Dave hadnât asked Bob what he actually had planned for tonight but he knew that there would be something on. Bob always had âsomething on tonightâ for as long as heâd known him.  Dave retraced his steps back to the train station in time to catch the 17:22, which would be late of course, back to Trimble on the Moor. He bought an evening paper to peruse on the train. He didnât really read any of the articles that passed for news and he often wondered why he actually bothered to buy it every night, but it had become a habit and Dave Martin was a creature of habit no matter how pointless or irrelevant it became. So there he sat on the train turning page after page of his paper, briefly pausing at the odd story or to look at the photographs of âBrave pup saves childâ âMan charged with attack on council allotmentâ and other fascinating tales.  The 17:22 lurched and swayed its way into the night and eventually pulled into the station at Trimble on the Moor where it spewed a few of its passengers onto the platform like a lapsed alcoholic on a Saturday night before continuing on its way North. Dave binned the evening paper as he walked through the exit and into Honeysuckle Lane. His cottage roof could be seen in the distance and he made his way slowly up the hill, his thoughts drifting up into the night sky like the dying embers of a long extinguished fire.  There was some mail lying on the floor when he opened his front door. A letter from a Mr Howard telling him that heâd already won a âsuperb prizeâ, an offer to join a mail order video club and two invitations to apply for credit cards (both of which were wrongly addressed). Each item was found a suitable place in Daveâs bin while he decided on a suitable feast for tea.  Finally settling on a boil in the bag chicken curry âwith authentic artificial flavouringâ he popped the bag into a pan of boiling water and settled down for a night of boredom in front of the telly. With what seemed like indecent haste bedtime arrived and Dave sloped off to bed, another day over, another day lying in wait beyond the cloak of night.  Dave slept the sleep of the dead.
