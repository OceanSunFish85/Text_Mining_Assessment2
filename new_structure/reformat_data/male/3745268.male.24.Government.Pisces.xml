      Alright, everyone has a blog, webpage, forum, or local BBS.  Do local BBSes still exist?  If anyone sees a local BBS for the Baltimore/Washington D.C. area, drop me a line.  I'd love to get involved in one.  Not that I need another hobby to half-ass, but I really miss Bulletin Boards.  And I'm not talking about that TELNET crap, I want a real modem dialup-    I just realized I don't have a modem anymore.  For anyone still using a modem, I'll let you in on the secret that the rest of the internet community with it's flash-induced pages assumes you have broadband connection at this point.  If not cable service then at least DSL.  Boy can I get off the subject.  Alright, a BBS in Maryland or D.C. with TELNET access we be alright too, but I'll hook my modem back up for a dialup board.  Anything else?  Pretty good for a first post right?  This doesn't mean I'm giving up on my webpage, just that this is easier for me to do from whereever I want.    I'll add the blog link to my website sometime this weekend.  Got a few other things to add this weekend too: my slightly procrastinated short story and my letter to the Command Sergeant Major (if you are in a very political military climate, or the 902nd, this letter will be entertaining).

      Alright, so I'm back in the habit of trying to write again. Not here mind you, but a short story I've been working on since... oh July of 2001. It started out as a bunch of brief stories independent of each other. It turned into a "novel in the works" after people commented on how well they thought the stories were written and that I should do something with them. So why am I telling you all this?  It's REALLY starting to get to me. Remembering back to certain moments hasn't been the easiest. I have to refer to my journal, my friends, people who aren't my friends but were sober enough to remember what actually happened. Not that the actual events matter mind you. It's based on my experiences but it's vastly warped in order to fit in the realm of fiction. Well, that and I have to fill in the memory gaps with something. I might as well embellish what I still remember to make it a bit more interesting in the process, right?  Sadly though, when people who were involved in the situations read it, they instantly take what I wrote as what happened. People who weren't even there comment on how funny that day was, and people who wereinvolved comment on how they wish they could've been there. It's like the guys who constantly rewrote history in Orwell's 1984. Were they the Ministry of Love?  I don'talways seem to have a choice when I'm writing as to where I take it. I find a path and my fingers do the rest. Then I go back many times over to make what my erratic fingertips performed to look a bit more sane.  So I'm going to start again. Haven't even started on being a father yet, that could almost be another book/short story/novella/essay/book report. Someone please try to keep me on top of it. If procrastination was an Olympic event, you can bet I'd be on the U.S. team.
