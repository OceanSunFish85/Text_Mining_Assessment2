						   "So make the effort to be fulfilled and enjoy yourself. Enjoy this Life. You will appreciate more and more. Don't waste another moment on a wasted moment. That's what we do. We waste one moment and then we waste four more on that moment. Go forward"  -Prem Rawat Amaroo, 2004

						   There is always a time when someone comes to terms with existence and recognizes the magic of this breath. Of course for some it's no surprise that we wake up and go on doing our dayly routine. But for the one who's life is a gift and knows its value, the surprise is always a pleasant one.  One day we may fall asleep for good and never wake up again. Same goes for our consciousness. That is the reason why, at times, I need to feel awaken and surprised. It's human nature to know and to feel this magic. I only have a prayer... please keep me always conscious of the gift I have when at times I may forget its value. Always let me rejoice for this existence you've given me. Always let me have gratitude and recognize where I am truly coming from. Because this is where I reside...inside... my true home.

						   There is one that keeps coming up at the top about God. I clicked on it, and at the start, it has an interesting concept to ponder on. It is something like, whatever you do, do it for the glory of God...eg. eating, etc.

						   For me, when I tune into the source of appreciation, the more I find I am able to enjoy what's around me in greater depth. This blog is a space for people to post, or enjoy visual creations (text too), and other things they enjoy.

						   The words of peace are seeds, which germinate in the compost of our heart. When we feel vagueness in our soul, let us suspend the instant and with respect and grace, let us choose one inspiration from the river of the breath, that one very particular, which carries us to our secret garden, where we can admire the small growths of serenity. And if the feeling delights us, then to talk of all these inspirations  which become a permanent spectacle .  Marie

						   Hi ... first just wished to thank-you for the invitation.  Any opportunity to express is a joy to me.  There is so much fulfillment flooding our individual doorsteps, that one has to allow that outlet to pour, so more joy can enter our domains.  I know that when we share in the moment the love that has been revelaed to us, it only brightens us further, as we enter that light that has infinite capacity.  In a world starving for this experience, it would be the ultimate level of selfishness if we did not allow it to be brought forth out into the public domain.  However really there is nowhere we cannot be where this love is not.   Just sometimes we can laser that concentration so it becomes more obvious.  So may we shine ... and in so doing assist in this noble endeavor to light the lamps that stand in wait, for just one strike of that matchless match.

						   "There is a joy, and it is the joy of existenceânot what is happening in existence. They are two different things. There is the joy of existence, and then there is the joy of what is happening in existence. What is happening in existence we try to control and manipulate.   Sometimes things go our way. Sometimes they don't.  But then there is another joy. That joy has been there through all the years of your life, waiting to be discovered. And that joy will be there for as long as you live. It is the simple, simple joy of being alive.   In my life, there are good days and there are bad days. The days I call good are the days when everything goes according to my plan. The days when things do not go according to my plan, I call bad. Yet every day that I have been given is above and beyond being good and bad. Each one has its own meaning and its own beauty. And I can get in touch with that beauty. My plans will change. Sometimes the days I call bad actually end up being good. And some days when everything looks like it is going according to my plan turn out to be a disaster.   Good and bad. Life is not just about good and badâit is beyond that. When we begin to understand that, we begin to understand that it is a privilege to be alive. It is a privilege for which this heart needs to be filled with gratitude. What we have been given is far more precious than all the good and the bad put together. All of that is transitory.   We can know that which isn't transitory, that which will be here as long as we are alive. That is our solace. That is our harbor. That is where we need to be when the storms come." -Prem Rawat(from Inspire newsletter 17)

						   It is the feeling you feel anyway,  when the words make no sense.  Not hindered by meaning, or concepts, or reason  Not to be distracted  following 'trains of thought'.  Free from the constraints of mental understanding  to absorb uncensored, undiluted, the atmosphere of love  the feeling  The language of love, beyond all words.      Kay

						   ..."We have to be strong in this world. To be safe, to be conscious, to be real in this life comes from inside. I canât fix the political system. What I can do is help people get in touch with their heart. I go around the world telling people they can have peace in their life. I started helping people when I was very young, and this is what Iâve been doing all my life. The dream was to be able to go from place to place, village to villageâand that is becoming a reality.  Every day is new. And thatâs wonderful. Enjoy your life, every moment. Thatâs how it should be. Donât lose the shield of hope. Learn how to hold onto it. You want that hope.  Sadness will always be there; sadness doesnât go away. All the sadness that you will ever feel is within you. And all the love that you will ever feel is within you. It just depends which door you want to open.  You have everything. Let me help you discover all those things again, how to hold onto the shield of hope. The world has pushed it away. But every day we can have hope. We can learn to smile again. We donât have to be sad. I canât tell anybody that their business will be better. But I know one thing: a centered person is what the whole world is looking for, because thatâs what we all need. So, just enjoy the ride..."  -Prem Rawat (from Inspire 14)

						   ..."You are beautiful. Why are you beautiful? You are beautiful because you are alive, not because of what you have accomplished. Thatâs not what makes you beautiful. You are beautiful because this breathâthe most divine gift of allâcomes into you. This breath comes in unchallenged, without judgment of good or bad, right or wrong. Every day, every moment, it comes into youâas personal as it possibly can be, touching only you. You can be in a room full of a hundred thousand people, and it will come and touch you. It will come and enter you. It will come and bless you.  Many people will tell you what you are not. I am here to tell you everything that you are. People will tell you everything that's wrong with you. I am here to tell you everything that is right with you.  Remember when you were a baby? I donât know when you realized you existed. It was probably at a very young age. âI am here.â The world revolved around you. You didnât know that, but it did. It was day, and you opened your eyes and you looked. In great majesty, you accepted this day because it was not for anyone else but you. Ideas of other people weren't there. You had no inhibitions. You had an incredible passion for one thing. It is what helped you grow up. That one passion you had when you were a baby was to find out for yourself. This was your passion. Your mother said, âDonât put that dirt in your mouth.â For you, it was: âWhatâs the big deal? I had to find out. Now I know.â   At some point, you gave up your great passion. Then anybody could come along and tell you, âThatâs no good.â And you would say, âOkay, thatâs no good.â Why was it no good? You didn't know. He said it was no good, and that was sufficient. This was a right you had. This was a power you had that you abdicated. Today, I would like to remind you of that power. I want you to get it back because the day you get it back, you will stand on your own two feet. That is the day you will start to say, âI need to know. I want to know. I must know for myself.â  You must know, not just have an idea or a concept. Those who are able to go beyond concepts are the ones who know. They are the ones who walk on their own feet. It's not that they walk on softer carpets or only on roads that go downhill. They walk the same road as anybody else, but they walk on their own feet. They make a simple determination in their lives, not in words, but by feeling. Thatâs what you need in this lifeâthat feeling, that understanding..."  -Prem Rawat ( from Inspire 18)

						   "So often peace is defined as the absence of war. There is war that happens between two countries. There is war that takes place between two people. There is war that doesn't even require two people; it takes place inside of a person. For a war on the outside, maybe a ceaseâfire can be negotiated. Between two people, maybe an understanding can be negotiated. But even in the absence of those kinds of wars, there is a war that takes place inside a human beingâa much more ferocious war that devastates the very elements that are the foundation of a person. Which of these wars will become absent so that one day we can stand up and say, "Now there is peace"?   Those people who have talked about peace in earnest have said, "What you are looking for is within you. You are the source and you are the resource for peace on the face of this earth."  -Prem Rawat (from Inspire 19)

						   "What is it that we want? What is it that we are all looking forânot as a universal thing, but each one of us as an individual? What does this heart of ours want? It wants joy, but not the kind of joy that is temporary in nature. It wants peace, but not the kind of peace that is temporary in nature.   A lot of people think the absence of war is peace. What I have come to understand is that, considering how long people have been fighting, the absence of war may never happen. That should not preclude the possibility of peace. Why do I say that? War has nothing to do with peace, and peace has nothing to do with war. There is a peace that transcends war. There is a peace that exists in itself. It does not need the absence of one thing to become the presence of another. That is the peace we are all looking for. That is the peace we wantâthe peace this heart wants."  -Prem Rawat(from Inspire newsletter 18)

Some things in life will be bad and some things will be good. Life is not about the bad. The most important thing is that you have this opportunity to be alive. Just accept that. It's an incredible gift. Enjoy this life. It's so important that you do. Everything is there to make the impossible possible"... -Maharaji/Prem Rawat (Inspire 15)

						   "The happiness that we are looking for is inside of us. Something needs to be felt within. Peace happens to be one of those things. Joy happens to be one of those thingsânot a joy that comes and goes, but a joy that permanently resides inside. Not a happiness that comes and goes, connected to the outer world, but a happiness that is always there. Even in the darkest moment, that joy resides within me. There is a solid feeling of peace when we go within and find that place.â -Prem Rawat
