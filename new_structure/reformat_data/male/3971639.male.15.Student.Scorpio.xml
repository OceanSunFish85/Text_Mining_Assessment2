      here's a thought-provoking little blurbfor you lucky cluezer:   do the birds sing? or do they chirp their musical melodies endlessly into the air? do the dogs and wolves howl? or do they cry out in pain and sorrow? does the wind blow, or does it howl a whisper of blowingness? what's life? life is life. or is life not life? questions can be answered, or they can be left unanswered. questions can sing. questions can howl. questions can blow. questions are life. questions are everything. questions are my world.   or are they?

      it's only 9 in the morning and i got 14 hours of sleep. that's because i went to bed at like 6:30 yesterday. okay, but just for the record, i wasn't tired. when i had my eyes open i wasn't tired and could've just went on living like a zombie, but when i lay down and shut my eyes then i was tired. ya...so i woke up at like 4 this morning i guess cause that was 10 hours of sleep and that's how much i usually get. and i had so many thoughts in my head like "wow, today i'm waking up at 4 but just a couple of days ago i went to bed a 4". it was quite a difficult concept to grasp. well, no, i lie. i was grasping it, it was just weird. but finally i got back to sleep, so THAT was good.    (8) what shall I do today, what shall I do today, what shall I do today, what shall I doooooooooooooo    p.s. wow i'm a loser

      well it's coming close to the end of a strange day. i didn't sleep last night, leaving me delerious and tired, as one might expect. hmm, well how it happened was i got off the computer at 3:30 right and then i went to bed and read, and then i read til like 4:45, but then it was so late (early) i didn't really feel like wasting time sleeping. anyways i wasn't really tired. so i just stayed up. it was tiring, quite. but now i'm not that tired. i've been awake for 30 hours and i'm not tired, now theres something seriously wrong with that.  i didn't do much during the day either, just playedps2, went to the corner store, bugged laura, used the computer ... (everythings spinnnnnnnnnnningggggggg) ... what a productive day.  okay ya so i'll try and go to bed early, if i can ... (everything's still spinning) ... and get a good night's rest. all in all, i'd say it was an interesting experience, that i hope not to experience anytime in the near-to-distant future.
