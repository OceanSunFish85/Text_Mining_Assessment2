      Kerry rocked the house tonight. Not only is it the best speech I have ever heard Kerry give, it was a speech that effectively debunked all of the perceived flaws of Kerry. Pessimistic? Pessimism is thinking Americans can't do better. Tax raiser? Yeah, on those who earn over $200,000 but cuts for everyone else. Waffler? He took stands on stem cell research, staying in Iraq, and resisting the privatization of health care. He masterfully weaved in his biography to display how "tough" he will be as president while reminding voters that HE knows the true cost of war first hand. And the sense of hope--the theme that the best is yet to come--bordered on inspiring.   Up until now I've been hoping the Democrats would have a chance and fell behind Kerry as the choice offered to us. Now, I firmly believe the Dems just might do it--and I am, for the first time, EXCITED to be following Kerry into the battle for the White House. As the U2 song said that played when Kerry was done, "It's a beautiful day!!!!!!!!"

                       st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                        So heâs not as inspiring as   Clinton  , but I donât care. My vote was locked when Edwards stepped on stage after Kerryâs speech and I could see him mouthing to Kerry, âYouâre gonna be President.â 2004 is our yearâ¦this guyâs going to the White House and I canât wait to see what he does once he gets there! I donât care if his hair if 2 feet tall.                    Ohâ¦and by the wayâ¦when Bush and Kerry debate I think Kerryâs going to wipe the floor with Bush.                    This is awesomeâ¦and I canât wait to be in DC to watch it happen.                    Kerry/Edwards 2004!!!!

      Did you know that the Torres family, of whom Hugo is scion, has substantial connections to the House of Froeman? That's right Froeman, as in Abe Froeman, the Sausage King of Chicago. What do you think Hugo was thinking about as he read One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish on the morning of July 24th, 2004? And later he paid for shipments of Sausages from Sacramento to Chicago. Hmmmm.....   But, besides the House of Saud part, I thought M. Moore did a pretty good job. He tackled too much, to be sure, but I think his goal was to show that the lies, problems, and general inanity of the Bush White House runs far deeper than just one issue. The Iraq stuff was good, as was the Florida recount part. It was just too much of a romp to be cogent, or at least too varied to be a powerful singular message. It was maybe a powerful Cingular message--like how I call MYcell phone plan my "more money for hookers--that's right, coke and hookers" plan.   Anyway, I digress from the real issue: is Mary Kate Olsen going to start at NYU next year? Or will she still be rexin' at her $9000 a week treatment facility? I'll leave it to Res Ipsa Loquitur's own NYU correspondent, Ms. Maggie D. Welles. Mags? What is it? Are the Olsen twins going to be at school next year? I must know. This is the burning issue that should be deciding the election, not some crap about Iraq or health care or terrorism. It's all about the Full House reruns.

       Don't get me wrong. I'm for sure voting democrat this year and every year. But, Michael Moore's latest film is trying way too hard, and trying to do too much. He could have easily blown open any one of a number of Bush White House snafu's, but instead he tries to blow them all open. I generally like Michael Moore, and I like his politics. But I think he's starting to head a little too deep into liberal "left" field to find huge conspiracies where there are just giant inconsistencies and stupid decisions. I worry that Moore's antics and tactics are getting tired and old. I worry too this his antics will ultimately detract from the overall message that he is trying to convey. He starts to look a little too Mel Gibson in "Conspiracy Theory" and less Al Fraken in "Radio Free America." Again...his message is important, but not everything is Oswald in the book depository.  Just my two cents...

      It's great that the parties have opened up the conventions to bloggers. One good blog about the Dems convention is at Slate.com,  urlLink http://www.slate.com/id/2104296/   In particular, take a look atsome interesting commentaryon Steve's favorite Illinois candidate, Obama...

      He's just great. He's gonna be president in 2016!  But Brian, I think you're missing Jason's point. I had a client last summer who can vouch for what the Daily Show was reporting. This guy (who was charged with perscription drug fraud) had sued Pacific Bell, and because of that lawsuit, the Clintons sent the Secret Service to steal his documents. This guy had to go into "exile" for a while, and when he returned, what happened? the DC cops trumped up this charge to keep him quiet.  I mean, c'mon, Flock, if you can't trust a schitzophrenic who at a pre-trial status conference yells at the judge "Look your honor, this trial is a sham. I know it. I've FUCKED BARNEY FRANK!", who can you trust?  Then again, this guy was a big Howard Dean supporter, so his judgment is at least somewhat questionable.

      SoI was at the San Diego Comic-Con this past weekend, the world's largest gathering of geeks and fans of all things entertainment related.While there,I attended a Star Wars presentation about the upcoming movie. The title of Episode III: "Revenge of the Sith" was met with cheers, the first of the prequel titles that fans seem to approve of. The coincidence of Comic-Con occurring around the same time as the Democratic National Convention has filled this correspondent's politcal geek heart with great joy. It has also prompted some thought as to how the Star Wars movies describe not only a galaxy far far away, but also our very own political climate. Think about it:    Episode I: The Phantom Menace    The Republicans harped on and on in the 90s about Bill and Hilary being the devil incarnate and how Monica Gate was ruining the Republic. But the real threat, unrecognized by all, was the bumbling good-natured presidential candidate known as Dubya, whom all though posed no threat...the good news at the end of the movie, a booming economy and an incumbent vice-president who won the popular vote, would soon give way to...    Episode II: Attack of Al-Qaida    A shocking attack on the Twin Towers sends Americans reeling, struggling to find a way to cope with tragedy and recover. Finding the time ripe to unleash his long standing plan, Dubya unleases his clone army...er...reservist army to invade Iraq. The Republic is plunged into a war it did not seek against the mindless droid armies...eh...terrorist armies, who did in fact seek such a war. Meanwhile, the principles of the Republic are undermined behind thescenes byEmperorCheney and hisapprentice, Dubya Vader,who slowly take away the freedoms long cherished bythe people. But not all hope is lost...    Episode III: Revenge of the Democrats    The growing Rebellion scores stunning victories, uniting behind Clone War...er...Vietnam War veteran John "Obi-Wan"Kerry. The Rebellion is further bolstered by the addition of fresh faced and idealistic John "Skywalker" Edwards. Holding their war council meeting known as the "Democratic National Convention", the team brings in the legendary Bill "Qui-Gon Jinn" Clinton to lead the attack. Which leads to the appropriately named start of the second trilogy that shows George Lucas was more than a visionary film maker but also a politcal prophet...    Episode IV: A New Hope!

       All right Jason...I know all the booze, drugs, and women have probably gone to your head, but I'm gravely dissappointed with your un-American and anti- Democrat ic viewpoint. You're either with us or against us. It's time to root out the sleeper moderates in the democratic party. If you're not an ultraliberal I'm going to have to bunker bust your attitude. We're at threat condition orange here people. If we don't move now we might have a republican in the White House for another four years. We don't have room in our party for division...so fall in line and be liberal. Support gay marriage, hefty social programs, health-care for all, and bigger government or move to another party. Oh...and by the way...don't even think about supporting Nader or I'll start breaking things. And they say us liberals are weak. Well we can strong arm just likethe republicans. Have a hefty dose of fear and paranoia for motivation Jason! =).

      I just watched "The Daily Show" last night and was horrified to discover that, according to the founder of the anti-Clinton presidential library,Clinton was involved with literally hundreds of murders. Everyone knows he is secretly working against Kerryso as to position Hillary for a 2008 White House run. Then they can turn the government over to the undead Nazi's that Clinton has been working for in secret the entire time.

      The excerpts from Clinton's speech last night that I'm posting below are the reason I'm proud to be a democrat! How is it we can't get this guy back into office???   "We Democrats want to build a world and an America of shared responsibilities and shared benefits. We want a world with more global cooperation, where we act alone only when we absolutely have to. We think the role of government should give -- should be to give people the tools and to create the conditions to make the most of their own lives, and we think everybody should have that chance."   "I think we're right for two reasons. First of all, America just works better when more people have a chance to live their dreams. And secondly we live in an interdependent world in which we cannot possibly kill, jail or occupy all our potential adversaries. So we have to both fight terror and build a world with more partners and fewer terrorists."

      I'd like to take a moment to plead for the repeal of the 22nd amendment, as I want Bill Clinton as my president again.  That's all for now.

                                  Welcome everyone to our new blog. This little venture, dreamed up by Hugo and I is an effort to have a forum where friends can chat and rant. Itâs a group blogâ¦not a personal blog. So post and comment away. This should be fun!

      Singer Rick James Dies at 56 By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSPublished: August 6, 2004 Filed at 3:25 p.m. ET LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Funk singer Rick James, best known for the 1981 hit ``Super Freak,'' died Friday, apparently of natural causes, police said. James, 56, died at 9:45 a.m. at a residence near Universal City, said Officer Esther Reyes, a Police Department spokeswoman. ``He died apparently of natural causes. We learned of his death after responding to a radio call,'' Reyes said.After his big hit, James' fame began to fade as he became embroiled in legal problems and health troubles. James was convicted in 1993 of assaulting two women. The first attack occurred in 1991 when he restrained and burned a young woman with a hot pipe during a cocaine binge at his house in West Hollywood. He was free on bail when the second assault occurred in 1992 in James' hotel room. James was sentenced to more than two years in state prison. In 1997, he released a new album, but a year later he suffered a stroke while performing at Denver's Mammoth Events Center, derailing a comeback tour. In 1998 he also underwent hip replacement surgery

                       st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                          Clinton       was on the Daily show this eveningâ¦and yet once he again he left me wondering what idiot passed the 22 nd  Amendment. He is dead on with his analysis that democrats need to start fighting back. Bush throws the first punch and the democrats just seem to take it. If we come out swinging we can win the election this year.                     By the wayâ¦my favorite line from   Clinton   on the Daily show was a quote from a Republican Senator who said âWell, if we fought fair youâd win all the time.â   Clinton   could mop the floor with Bush Jr.                    If you get a chance to see the interview on a re-run watch it. The best part may have been when Daily mentioned the news that Halliburton had recently been fined 7.5 million dollars by the SEC. His comment was âTravel-gateâ¦come on.â Asking the President, âDoesnât it just make you mad?â

       He was super freaky and super drugged out, but now he's super dead, and that's not super at all. Rick James was a legend and I hope he's found his way to that pimped out crib in the sky where Biggie, 2 Pac, Grand Master Flash, and Jam Master J are all kickin' it with their ho's from different area codes. Keep it real Rick, keep it real. I'll pour a 40 oz. out for you and all the homies. Never slack on your pimpin'.
