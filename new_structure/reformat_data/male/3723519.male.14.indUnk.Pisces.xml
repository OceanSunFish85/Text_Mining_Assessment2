      Itâs recently dawned on me that the self injury forums I used to go to, really fucking suck.  I made the mistake, AGAIN, to go back and make a post saying Iâm still here in one piece.  So, being an idiot, after I post me little shit on myself recently, I look around at other posts.  Well, to say the least, everyone kisses the Admin., Gabrielleâs ass.  It doesnât matter what she posts about, its right.  Every god damn post by Gabrielle gets mass appraised, like sheâs is all all-knower, everything she says is right, doesnât matter what she says, its right, she could say she hates Jews, black people and fags and people would all go, "yes gabs you are so right, thanks for pointing that out to everyone since its only right when you say it, let me kiss your ass until my lips become chappedâ.  If you donât believe me, check out this link: http://gabrielle.self-injury.net/index.php?s=8e07ac6b6e7b0dd4c2818efa5361c7cb  I swear, thatâs seriously how it goes around there.  Thereâs also all these posts by emo kids who are all the following:  xXx3M0grrlxXx replies: yes gabs I love you and I want to sex you so I can become a moderator, I'll whine to you when some one calls me an emo kid because all I do is write poetry and lyrics with my friends, oh wait, I have no friends, I hate it when people call me emo. *MAY MOTHER FUCKING TRIGGER YOU FUCKERS*  No lie, that is straight up from the place, I could never imitate the level or quality of which the content of the users is there, I love myself.  All I gottaâ do now is get my accomplice to email me, so we can start fucking the place up again, like how I got banned from the whole artwork/creativity section.  Maybe this time, I can get banned from the whole mother-fucking site!!  To verify this, I have nothing against the admin, Gabrielle.  Itâs just all her little, minions, that piss me off the most.  All her little minions who run around her like sheâs Jesus himself with the winning lottery ticket from 11-billion dollars.  Changing subjects now, I recently released a tutorial on photo *ENHANCMENT*, on my deviantart page.  So far, itâs gotten like, 150 views in the first 24 hours, Iâm rather proud of that.  Now, like every thirty minutes, I get like, one more view, so every ten minutes some one look at it and learns.  Hopefully they learn, anyway.  Well its best I go to bed, I gotta get some good picture taking in tomorrow, so I better be well rested.  Iâll link up the photos I take here, maybe, or just gave you the link to my deviantart page again.  Iâm outizzle.

      Well, he didnât come over today, which kindaâ surprised me, or he did come over and I didnât hear him.  Only he knows really.  All I did today was play Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and make a tutorial on photo editing.  You can check it out at http://www.deviantart.com/view/8390435/ , since I donât exactly know how to post real links yet.  Yâall are going to have to wait for that part, since Iâm not up to date on all the coding shit that all you people seem to know.    !Warning, some fucking emo shit is coming up read at your own risk!  Ding dong, here comes the shit mobile, and you know what itâs got packinâ today?  A barrel full of loneliness!  God I felt horrible today.  All day I had Spencer on my mind, and you know who is now?  Mother-fucking Nikki is all in my head now.  Jesus after watching Bad Santa and that girl looking and sounding just like Nikki, made me think of her like mad.  Sheâs still on my mind to this second, which, kinda pisses me off, since I swore to myself that Iâd never think of her like this again.  I couldnât go out with her again since after all this shit thatâs happened, god I donât know what to think anymore.  I know Nikkiâs going to read this since I showed her the link today, I know sheâll bookmark it or something and check it tomorrow, I just know thatâll happen.  Apparently she likes my cousin, Sam, too, which is kinda; weird since theyâve never met.  Nikki IS moving to Edmonton or somewhere around there in august, just about the time Iâll be there too.  Oh joy, I know my conscience wonât let me go there without seeing her once, Iâd feel bad if I didnât.  The only good thing that came out of that girl from the movie reminding me of Nikki was that it looked like she made mighty-fine sex.  Maybe thatâs a sign?  Hah, I doubt it anyway.  Nikkiâs as cold and frigid as a popsicle.    It was sunny out today, but too windy for any chance to get a good picture in.  Some cool looking clouds did roll in though, but all these god-damn houses and living at the bottom of a hill really makes it hard to get a good shot in.  Hopefully tomorrow itâll be mother-fucking hot with no wind so I could go to Government House or Butchart, like I said in my last two fucking posts.    Iâm out.

      Wow, second post, Iâm on fire.    I had Colin come over today; we ate chicken fingers and watched the Ali G Show on showcase.  Thatâs one of the funniest things Iâve ever seen in my life.  Just search for it, âDa Ali G Showâ, and youâll know why itâs so great.    After that, I played a bit of Burnout 2, while he played Diablo 2.  All of a sudden, BAM, Leeâs over again.  I swear that kid has come over everyday for who knows how long now.  He moved here from South Africa about a month ago, and apparently weâve become best-buddies now.  He talks a lot, Iâve noticed, and I know heâs going to be coming over tomorrow, I just know it.  Heâll also come over the day after that, and the day after that, and the god-damn day after that.  He got bored of the other kid next-door, so heâs moved on to me.  Great.  I always have such a great âol time with him too.  Hopefully itâll be sunny soon too, besides a break from all the damn cloudiness, Iâll be able to go somewhere, take some pictures, and relax.  Then after that, I could just go home and lie down, after I uploaded my new photos, of course.  Since Iâm so computer savvy, and I neeeeed it in order to liveâ¦.  Iâm so pathetic.  God Iâm really not looking foreword to Lee coming over, I know it sounds bad, but sometimes heâs annoying.  I donât have the heart to tell him to leave, since Iâd feel so bad afterwards.  Itâd be fine if he came over occasionally, but not everyday.  Itâd also be great if he didnât just go on my computer then go to all these hacking sites, fill my computer up with spyware, and then it gets fucked to shit!  God I wish I could tell him to just not come everyday, but I canât.    I wish I had the balls to tell him that, along with other things I should say to people.  See, thatâs the problem with me, Iâm too afraid to speak up.  Itâs gotten to the point where I can hardly ask the waiter for a re-fill of my drink since Iâm too afraid to.  It makes me feel awful that I canât speak up like that.  It makes me feel so small, so, insignificant.    God I hate talking about this stuff.  Iâm out.

      Well, hereâs my first real post I guess.  Today, was shitty, literally, I had to go to work with my dad (heâs a plumber) to change a pump at a duck pond at Government House.  Having to go through all the gardens, then into a big pool full of snapping turtles and duck shit, kindaâ sucked.  When we got there, we had to fix something else sine the last plumber was useless and didnât do it right, so there was water shooting up everywhere were it wasnât supposed to, it was nuts.  But all in all it went rather well, Iâm going to go back there on a sunny day with my camera, since the grounds there are beautiful.    That reminds me, I havenât really taken any photos lately.  Iâm thinking this summer; Iâll go back up to Botanical Beach again.  Or maybe I could go to Butchart Gardens, Iâve never been there before but apparently itâs quite a place.  As I also said above I could go back to Government House, or just around that general area.  Going to Beacon Hill is always great too.  I need some feedback, from you, the only person whoâs probably read this, should I buy a panoramic lens, or an ultra-zoom lens?  Check out my photography at http://jakesmash.deviantart.com , to see what Iâve got so far.  Hopefully, some one WILL read this, and comment to that.  Well, I bet youâre wondering, since this my first post, what Iâm all about.  Well, Iâm a fourteen-year-old kid living in British Columbia, Canada, I have far too much time on my hands, I love to be the amateur photographer that I am, and amateur graphics designer, to that I am.  I spend most my time making new images, thinking of a new image, or biking with my friends Don and/or Kyle.  Iâm going into grade nine next year; with a school full of grade twelveâs (oh joy).  Iâm currently single and not sure if Iâm looking for some one or not, Iâm kindaâ confused over whether I should or not!  AND!!! If you need to know more, just contact me or whatever, and Iâll be happy to answer your questions (within reason =)).    Well, thatâs about it for the first entry, I didnât want to go all out and emo on you all, since I tend to be like those little emo bastards and whine a lot.  Youâll just have to wait for that!!  -Iâm out.

      Long time, no post AGAIN!?!?!?!? TWF LAWL OMG!!!1111!11ONE!!1!1!~~~   I havenât âreally felt like writing lately, and I donât right now, Iâm just forcing myself to write âcause I should.   I leave for Edmonton in about four days, I leave on the 31st, and come back the TWO WEEKS LATER!?!?!?! I donât know when I come backâ¦.   I should take some new pictures before I go to Edmonton, or at least write another entry. I wonât be able to write when Iâm in Edmonton, since my aunt will defiantly check where Iâve gone on her computer, since she already doesnât trust her 15 and 16-year-old boys and checks their computers for pr0ns and such. Thatâs how the parents found my old journal, my aunt told them, since I sent Sam a link about something I wrote about once. Oh well, all Iâll go to is probably DA or Shockwave to pay games, since thereâs nothing else to do in between outings.   Whatâs cool is the spell checker for MS Word didnât pick up âpr0nsâ as a misspelled or improper word. Pr0ns must kick ass, or while I was sleeping, I programmed 1337 into the spell-checker sub-consciouslyâ¦.   Colinâs coming over tomorrow, weâll probably just go on the trampoline and play Diablo 2, since thereâs NOTHING FUCKING ELSE TO DO AROUND HERE. Maybe weâll put water all over the trampoline again, that was so fun.   Me and Don put water all over the trampoline yesterday, and it seems like you jump so much higher when its wet and on a hot day, its to refreshing to be all jumpy in wetness. I really donât know if that sounds dirty to anyone, I donât really know myselfâ¦. If it is dirty to you, shame on your dirty mind!   I feel like I have so many ideas in my head for pixel art, its pissing me off. I canât either get the idea straight, or I donât have the m4d skills to make what I want.   Again the spell-checker didnât pick up a 1337 word, âm4dâ was left un-noticed!   Yeah, too many ideas meanâs bad-news-bears.   Fucking bearsâ¦.   Iâm out.

      Lets all gather âroud while Jake tells his story about the past two days!    Tuesday I got up at like, 12 like I normally do. At 2, Zac came over and we went to EB to trade in some old games I had. I canât believe I got seventeen bucks for fucking Warioland, it was amazing. I got 40 fucking dollars credit all together, so I bought Four Swords for seventeen dollars, it was cool shit.    We went back, and played Four Swords until about 3, then went to sleep because I was tired. BAM, five hours later, the fuckers from ADT come and start drilling holes and shit everywhere to put in the security system, and I only got like, 5 hours of sleep. So we get up, play more Four Swords, and then Mike came over and we went on the trampoline. I shouldnât wear shorts on that thing, Iâm burning my knees to shit.    The ATD guys finished, and my friends went home. Iâm not sure, something about this security system is fucking killing me. Its making me worry to shit. Either itâs an anxiety attack, or something is really bothering me about this thing. Maybe Iâll just take it âeasyâ and then go to bed. Maybe play some FFTA while Iâm in bed, that makes me more calm also.    I also got a shitty hair-cut today. They never ever turn out the way I want them too. I mean, I look so gay. I want it to be long again, like it was!     urlLink http://bohemian_films.tripod.com/bohemianfilms222/id6.html  emo farm.

      Well a semi-long-time no post eh?    Well I did get my camera back two days ago, Iâve taken a few pictures already, but none of them are very good. I havenât uploaded any of them either, of course, since they arenât any good.    Iâve started doing pixel art again, Iâm not sure why, but I have. Iâve made a few Kirby animations and some 1-bit things, trying to get as much detail in with only one colour. I plan to make more Kirby animations and more 1-bit works in the future. As always, Iâll upload them to my DA page!    The day before yesterday, Thursday I think, Zac and Don stayed over, we stayed up until about 6:30 playing Diablo 2 and old school Super Mario. The next day Zac stayed until about 8:30. Then his dad picked him up. During that time is when I made my Kirby animations, and some other various things. Sometime this week I hope to get out somewhere and get some shots in, Iâve been wanting to do that lately.    Iâve found I donât worry as much about things when I should be worrying about things. I mean, when my camera was stolen, I wasnât worried about it, not in the least, I was mostly worried about that some one was looking for me âcause they found information on my through the internet. Thatâs all I was worried about, not the 90% chance of me never getting my camera back, nope, no way. When thereâs something I should be worrying about, Iâm worrying about something completely un-related and stupid. Maybe thatâs how anxiety works, I donât really know.    There are two chances I may be able to see Denika this summer. One: When I go to Edmonton on the 31. Two: When she comes here with her parents on vacation on an unknown date as of late. Hopefully, Iâll get to see her at least once, seeing her twice would be a gift, pretty much.   And mom/dad, if youâre reading this, please fuck off, I mean, how else am I supposed to vent whatâs in my head when I donât have any counselors? I mean, Dr, Jack closed my fucking file, what am I supposed to do?    Anyway, I think thatâll be all for now, when I feel emo later on maybe Iâll write some more. Since you all know, when Iâm being an emo fuck-face, you  ALL  need to hear about it.  Iâm out

      Well, last Thursday really fucking sucked.  My fucking camera was stolen, right out of my house.  I come home from the last day (thank god) of camp the find everything in my room thrown around, everything from the power bar for my computer unplugged, and my camera gone.  The mother-fucker even took the battery charger with the camera.  I mean, I had to spend the day on a fucking island starring at her, and HIM flirting with her, then I come home, looking foreward to going out the next day to take some pictures, and BAM, cameraâs gone.  LUCKILY, even before we phone the police to say some one broke in, they already had caught guy, had him in custody and had my camera.  The only problem with that is that I wonât be able to get it until at least Thursday, no guarantees with that either.  The kicker is, this afternoon was completely full of about the coolest clouds I have ever seen.  I mean, these things were amazingly cool.  I know theyâll also be there tomorrow, and every other day I donât have my camera.  The minute I get my camera back, is the minute all the clouds go away for me.  What a bitch, eh?  With losing my camera, I seem to have lost all creativity in me.  I have been compelled, or even felt like making anything, or even just editing a photo Iâve already taken.  Once I get my camera back, I donât know where Iâm going, but fuck, Iâm going somewhere and taking some god-damn pictures.  With those god damn pictures, I will edit slightly to make the look better, upload them to my DA page, and then continue work on the Pixel City project Iâve decided to make.    The Pixel City Project, so far, you make a small portion, or even just a building of a city, and in the end I will add them all together, and make one massive pixel city.  So far Iâm only working on my portion.  This isnât an actual project yet, but I will ask around, and see if I should go through with it.  I would love if this project actually worked, but I doubt any of the major pixelists, or anyone who knows how to pixel in the least, will ever find out about it, or even want to take part in it.  Like I said before, Iâm going to ask around, see what people think, and if all lights are green, Iâll make a downloadable base for people to start building on.    I am also thinking about writing another tutorial.  My first two, especially my first, have done rather well, and I think I will be making another within the summer.  Or even before I go to Edmonton.  Iâm thinking of it either being on basic pixel art, or horror/macabre art.  I like both, equally, so I put up a post on my actual DA page, asking people if they want either; a basic pixel art tutorial, or a horror/macabre art tutorial.  Thatâs if anyone wants one, or let alone reads the entry!  I also talked with George today, which is kind ofâ cool.  I never really get the chance to talk to him, âcause usually when I try, all I get from him is a âSUP Uâ, and it goes nowhere.  To my surprise, he talked to me first, and we kind ofâ had a real conversation for a bit, before  I ask something and he never talks again.  Apparently he was in Taiwan  for a bit, or Iâm just a bad read and Dasha is really the one in Taiwan, I donât know.    Iâm out.

      Wow, today of this camp bullshit sucked even more.  More egownage(getting your ego owned), more boredom, and more stupidity!  First the day starts out rally shitty, its raining, windy, mini-golf isnât looking to good for later in the afternoon.  You know what the alternative for mini-golf was?  Swimming!  Yes, good âol swimming, since I love swimming so muchâ¦.  Well, me and Zac got there really early, so we had absolutely nothing to do for an hour.  Slowly all the little fuckers arrived and the place was full of the little skater punks and annoying ugly kids.  Today two new kids showed up also.  One fucking homie, and a fairly attractive girl, that I am un-sure the age of.  Well, the homie wasnât bad until the afternoon.  Then he started to really act like a fucking homie and act all hard and shit.  He keeps going on how gangster he is and how much heâs done.  Mind you heâs talking to a bunch of 12-year-olds.    This whole time Iâve been glancing over at this girl, each time she looked better and better.  Also more and more unavailable.  After bowling in the morning and mini-golf in the afternoon, we went to Thetis for the last hour of the day.  Of course, me and Zac didnât go swimming, since we both hate it.  We both get egowened since we have horribly low self-esteem, and then I look over again at this girl, and sheâs flirting with the fucking homie.  I really though, I would be able to talk to her, then.  But he had to be there.  Even worse, she liked it.  I could see she liked him doing it.  Iâm so fucking pathetic, I get triggered by nothing and get real shitty, and itâs bullshit, really.  Iâm out for now.

      âWhen you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, FUCK YOU! Fuck your dreams, fuck your hopes, fuck everything you thought this life would bring you.  Now go out there and make this bitch happyâ. 					-Chris Rock on relationships.  Today was pretty shitty actually.  Day one, of the three day fucking day camp I HAVE to go to started today.  Last night I got like, three hours of sleep.  I feel asleep at four, and had to get up at seven.  I havenât done that in who knows how long, so it was hard getting up.  When we go there, Zacâs mom drops us off at the wrong place, and we have to go to some other place, where who do we find?  We find fucking Greg there.  So really, thereâs a group of seventeen kids including myself, Zac, fucking Greg, and a bunch of kids who are below my chin.  First, we had two hours to blow before we went to laser tag (which sucked), so we went to Thetis Lake for two hours.  Guess what me and Zac did?  Absolutely nothing.  We both hate swimming and we werenât allowed to go off the fucking beach, it was shit!  Finally after two hours of nothing, all the little buggers got on the bus with us to go downtown to Laser City.  Some kids really suck at everything, one teams only tactic was to sit in a corner.  Wow, thatâs a good one, after the first time we get shot, we know youâre there, just get up you lazy son-of-a-bitch.  In the end, our team won, and we only had six people instead of seven.  In the total rankings, I wasted all the little kids, and came in third, with the two counselor people being in first and second.    After that we went to Johnny Zeeâs and I played a little DDR after not playing since last august.  I got so wasted, Iâve hardly moved since summer, so playing DDR was quite a feat in its own.  After I got too tired to continue, and I showed the MILF (or older sister) and her daughter (younger sister) how to play, I went to play Rush 2049 with Zac, and then the only cool little kid came up and played with us.  The cool kidâs name is Jesse, and he beat me and Zac, talk about getting your ego owned by some little kid.  Anyway after that I played Time Crises 3 with Zac to use up the last of our tokens.    In the end, I guess itâs good I at least did something today, other than sit around.  Iâm so tired right now, its stupid.  I hope I get a better rest tonight, and that god damn counselor fucks right off, âcause she pisses me off.    Oh yeah, some one stole the mirrors on the shit-mobile of a bus we were one while we were in Johnny Zeeâs, whoever did, is my hero.   I dunno if you people do, but I really love watching those god-damn reality game-shows.  Right now, Iâm watching For Love or for Money 2, and Who Wants to Marry My Dad.  Both I may add, are quite shitty, but thereâs nothing on until summers over, when all the regular shows start.    Iâm such a dork.  Iâm out.

      A NIGHTâS FLYING  By Jake J(smash)  As we pulled up the hanger, I got a little nervous.  I wondered if this guy, our next-door neighbour, really knew how to fly this kind of plane.  In the back of my mind I knew he could, itâs just in my nature to worry about such things.  It was a beautiful evening; the sun was setting making the western sky appear red.  Mount. Baker stood clear and tall, somewhat veiled by the other hangers and control towers of the airport.    We all got out, and got our stuff from the carâs truck.  I grabbed a sweater, not knowing how cold it would be however high we went up.  We headed towards the tiny plane we were going to go up in, and get everything ready to go.  Daryl first got headphones for all of us, and went over everything to make sure the plane was in flying order.  Me and Lee climbed in the back and buckled ourselves in.  My dad pushed the seat back and climbed in after as along with Daryl.  From the outside, the plane looked as if it couldnât hold us all, but once we were settled in, there was plenty of room for us, even in the back.     Waiting for Daryl to get everything in order, I looked at the sunset for a distraction to pass time, and to ignore Lee talking about whatever he was.  The whole scene of the huge puffy red clouds and tree-ey hills was quite something.  I guess about 10 minutes passed and bam, we were in the air.  It still wasnât too dark out, so everything was still easy to see.  As we climbed higher, my ears popped from the air pressure from being so high up.  I always hated that feeling of my ears popping, anyway.  We flew over Cowachin Lake, then on to Duncan and Nananimo.  We did a touch and go at the Nananimo air port, and head towards Vancouver, over the water.  The sunset looked even better over the water and at the altitude we were at.  When we were about half-way to Vancouver, Daryl pulled some crazy moves to make us float for a second or two.  That feeling of just floating, was better than any roller coaster Iâve ever been on.  By the time we had made it to Vancouver, it had become quite dark, and the whole city was lit up like a giant Christmas tree. We flew over downtown Vancouver, which was one of the most amazing things Iâve seen.  It looked as if every window in every building was twinkling, like the person inside that room kept flicking the lights on and off, on and off.  Really, the whole city was like that.  We flew over the heart of Vancouver and towards Surrey, then back towards Victoria.    On the way back to Victoria, my dad had called my mom on his cell phone, to go out in the backyard when he said, and use his super flash light to see if we could see it from up there.  So when the time came, we saw Tillicum mall and counted the number of streets until ours, and surely enough, we saw the light blinking at us.  It was the weirdest sight, to see something so far down to the earth, from something so high above the earth.  We then flew over downtown, where we saw the Empress Hotel and the Legislative Building.  We flew over to where the cruise-liners dock, and surprisingly there were three there.  Each one was brightly lit-up and had multiple pools on the deck.   We then flew back over downtown, when we notice the moon rising in the east.

We made about three circuits over the airport, just looking at this moon.  The orange light that radiated from it made a beam of orange light on the oceanâs surface, almost like a highway to the moon itself.    We decided to land after the third look at the moon, and go home.  We landed a little roughly, and came to a nice and easy stop to where we had to park the plane.  We packed up our stuff, checked to see if the plane was ready for the next user, and headed on back home.  It was convenient that we all live in the same three rows of houses, so we didnât really have to drop anyone off.  We all went our separate ways, thus ending the night of flying, and new memories, to last us a lifetime.   -----------  I wrote this a few minutes after I got back from going out flying with Daryl my dad and Lee.  Yes, the Lee that annoies me to no end.  I also uploaded this to my Da page, check it out  urlLink here .

      Hello everyone.  I'm back from Edmonton now, and I had a great time.   I took some grat photos on my dA page,  urlLink http://jakesmash.deviantart.com  .  I can't write too much because Don is over right now.  I've asked Kalie out again, because I feel it would be the right choice.  Damn she lookd hot today, hahaha.  Too bad she didnt talk much, I like hearing her voice.   Some other night I'll write about my adventure in Edmonton.
