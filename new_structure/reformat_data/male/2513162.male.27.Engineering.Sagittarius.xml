       Upon reading the comments left on my first attempt to outline the problems* of the WPT,  urlLink Mean Gene  gave me what I think is the most important thing that the WPT is lacking this year, and why, if it doesnât change soon, the WPT will become even more boring and predictable.  There are no more villains.  At least, they havenât been around a lot on the WPT.  What you have, on most of the WPT shows, especially this year, are usually 1 or 2 of the âbelovedâ poker pros (Howard Lederer, Phil Ivey, even that  urlLink hayseed  Hoyt Corkins) and the rest of the unknown amateur players.  Hellmuth has made 1 final table this year (and one last year that he was invited to) and heâs the most lovable villain of them all.   [Side note: I love Phil Hellmuth. I think heâs, hands down, the funniest person in poker today. But thatâs another post.]   Even the semi-villains like Scotty Nguyen, who can be as annoying as Hellmuth, has been absent from the WPT cameras.  I agree with Mean Gene that everyone loves to root for an underdog.  But for there to be an underdog, there has to be a favorite that people truly despise.  There has to be the âEvil Empireâ (Yankees, Cowboys, Red Sox, Lakers, bandwagon-team-du-jour) to root against.  Otherwise, itâs not compelling.  And really, the fact that the âmajorâ poker stars have rarely won any of the events does little to improve their cachet. Bring us the âevilâ poker pros that we all know and love to hate.  Then, rooting for the underdogs becomes fun again.  Then, the WPT becomes more compelling and âbetterâ.  I also realize that the WPT has zero control over any of this.  They canât help the fact that their final tables are only filled with people that the viewers a) donât know, b) donât care about or c) genuinely like.  But Iâm awaiting the return of the villain.  Let them win a few tournaments.  Let them be assholes while doing it.  Then, it becomes more fun to watch them get sucked out on by a 24 year old Party Poker playing college student.   * Letâs face it.  Are these really major problems? No way.  They are more âthings that irritate me on a superficial levelâ, but they are things that, left unchecked, can become potential problems for the WPT down the line.  I wouldnât mind if they ended a half hour early one week and filled the time with  urlLink Shanna  frolicking on a beach somewhere.  Or show all of the tournament first and leave the 30 minutes of âfillerâ that they spread throughout the show to the end.  Just give us something different from time to time (but no more timeclock, for the love of God).

       Maybe fish bashing has become too chic for its own good.  And, just maybe, itâs a little bit wrong.  Everyone says âdonât tap on the glassâ, but perhaps, if itâs done the right way, tapping on the glass can be good for everyone.  Letâs face it, clubbing the fish over the head every night and taking their bankroll can be fun at first, but it has to quickly get boring.  So what do you do? You play multiple tables to beat up more fish at once.  But, are you really  playing  poker? Is it even fun anymore? Are you learning anything at all?  I guess it really comes down to the old âwhy do you play poker?â question that has appeared in so many blogs in the past.  If your aim in playing poker is to make money (but not be a pro), then just being better than the fishiest of fish is good enough.  I would think this gets incredibly boring after a while, and the grind will suck all of the fun out of something that you probably thought was a fun game.  Itâs like being the smartest person in middle school.  Fun for a while, but as you get older, doesnât really mean all that much.  I donât really think any of the poker bloggers fall into this category.  I would suspect that most of the people that spend any amount of time thinking about (much less writing about) poker are people that want to improve their own play, that enjoy poker for the game that it is, and take advantage of the fish that they find along their journey.  There is a drive in most people to find the next conquest, to set up the next challenge.  All you have to do is read other blogs or poker forums to see people every day setting up new challenges (usually bankroll related) in their quests to become better poker players.  These are people not content with just picking off the low-level fish, no matter how horrible their play is.  These challenges may not be the best way to improve themselves, but it shows that they are at least thinking about ways of getting better, while keeping the game fun for them.  And, believe it or not, most of the fish that are out there want to be better players as well, but they probably just donât have a clue on how to begin.  Sure, there are the gamb0000lers out there, willing to play ATC and donât really care.  They have $50 and, damnit, poker is just entertainment to them and theyâre gonna have all the fun they can for that $50.  They get up and leave the table and donât really care.  I find it hard to believe that most of the fish out there feel that way.  If that was the case, the âpoker revolutionâ would have collapsed by now, with those gamblers burning through their bankrolls long ago.  No, there are people that burn through their deposits and then load up again, determined to do better, and to learn more about playing.  Theyâre going about it the wrong way, but they are looking to be educated.  Now, Iâm not suggesting that we all take pity on the fish and stop beating them.  There are no friends at the table.  But I think, at the same rate, smiling at them and saying âNice handâ when theyâve clearly made a horrible play and paid you off this time does not do either of you well in the long run.  Now, this is not to say that you need to take the player aside and teach him all your secrets, but a little knowledge never hurt anyone.  I think itâs a much better strategy to extract everything you can from a player, and then leave them a little knowledge at the end.  Then, the next time you play against them, they may be a little bit better from what you told them, or from a book you pointed them to, but then again, you should be a little better as well.    It reminds me of Toyota, who is one of the leading companies in the world in âcontinuous improvementâ of their manufacturing processes.  They regularly invite people from competing companies to come in and tour their facilities.  It is completely unimaginable for a company like GM to do this because, from GMâs perspective, why would you want to give away any of your secrets to people trying to put you out of business?  So GM, et al, come in and tour Toyota, take the ideas they think are good and bring them back to incorporate them into their own processes.  What they fail to realize, however, is that Toyota is already 3 to 5 iterations further along in the process development, and is still ahead of GM.  They still improve their competition by sharing information, and use that as a driver to improve themselves.  They stay ahead of the curve by being better than their competition and by sharing things theyâve figured out that other people may have not.  So, by all means, become better poker players, for that really is the aim of what we are trying to do (I think).  Build your bankroll, move up in limits, but donât kill all the fish on your way through.  Treat them with a little bit of understanding, a little bit of knowledge and stay ahead of the curve.  Everyone will be better in the long run for it.

       Perhaps this is just my observation, but the WPT shows this year are significantly worse than last years.  Could it be that the WPT has been hyped to no-end by every new poker player and his grandmother, or could it be that the DOJ rulings forbidding the advertisement of online gambling has thrown a monkey-wrench in the events?  At any rate, the games just aren't as interesting to me.  Here's the list of problems that I see:  1.  No Momentum :  One new episode followed by 2 weeks of repeats makes it tough to keep the momentum of poker on TV going.  This probably has to do with reproduction of the events due to the DOJ ruling, but damn it's frustrating.  2.  No Intrigue or Drama :  Aside from watching Dewey Tomko go all-in on like 8 (televised) hands in a row, the WPT format has become entirely predictable. Oh it's 10:53? I guess I know who wins now.  It's a bit anti-climactic.  It's also getting a lot easier to see/predict when the bad beat or suckout cards are going to come, mainly from Mike or Vince saying "He only has one card in the deck that will help him" or something to that effect.  More times than not, it will hit the board. Unless they're getting pressed for time.  3.  No New Characters :  This is the thing that the WPT probably has the least amount of control over, but how many times can we see or hear about Gus Hansen being a maniac. Yes he's a maniac, he's brilliant, etc.  Hey, here's Paul Phillips again. He made all his money on the internet.  Gee, I didn't know that Annie Duke is Howard Lederer's sister...let's hear about that again. Phil Ivey is the Tiger Woods of Poker? I forgot that from the last 1000 times I heard it.  I still enjoy watching it and will continue to watch it when it's on.  I'm just saying that it's less enjoyable than it was a year ago, when it was new and fresh.  Hopefully the people over at the WPT have some ideas to keep it fresh and interesting (except that shot-clock type debacle...that I can do without).

       Since Iâve now (somewhat) spilled my guts and confessed that Iâm no longer playing online, I have a hell of a lot more time on my hands.  And, despite the fact that there is a hell of a lot of good writing going on out there in blog-land, thereâs only so much poker blogging that I can read before my brain goes on overload and just wants to lounge in a wading pool full of gin.  So I have to find times to take breaks and read/think about other things.  In that vein, here are the last 3 things that Iâve read:  1.   The Davinci Code  by Dan Brown â Yes the chapters are like 5 pages long and the print is ridiculously huge and thereâs 130 chapters.  Yes, it reads like a summer blockbuster movie starring Ben Affleck or Russell Crowe, but itâs a fun book.  Plus Iâm a sucker for puzzles, secret societies and conspiracy theories.  Iâm not a tin-foil hat type, but I enjoy a good conspiracy as much as the next guy.  Overall, not a bad book.  2.   Positively Fifth Street  by James McManus â Okay.  Itâs about poker, albeit somewhat.  Plus thereâs extensive talk about strippers, murder, tar heroin and the not-so-gentlemanly behavior of pokers Old School, things I find incredibly appealing (aside from the heroin and murder).  Additionally, thereâs a very odd section about Sylvia Plath that seemed to be a bit of a non sequitur in that it seemed to loosely connect with the other major plotlines, but was interesting reading nonetheless.  You wonât learn how to beat Jesus or TJ in this book, but itâs very entertaining.  3.   Kitchen Confidential  by Anthony Bourdain â Iâm a minor foodie, enjoy meddling around in the kitchen (and moreso around the grill and smoker) and pretend that I know what Iâm doing.  I havenât lost a finger â yet â and this book is really a great read for those who really want to know what goes on in the restaurant industry.  If you donât really want to know how your food is treated before it gets to your table, or the assortment of âinterestingâ characters that prepare it, then donât read this book. Itâs not for the weak stomached.  An interesting undercurrent in my brain now is, despite what I read, I am always trying to draw parallels with playing poker.  Most of the time it doesnât work or it gets jumbled before I get to write anything coherent down, but at least I am thinking about it, which can only be good for me when I finally do decide to sit back down at a table. I know that only play and practice can bring true confidence in your game, but I am getting to a point where I feel like, when I do return to playing poker, I will be smarter than the other people at the table, and that Iâll be able to run them down.    Mind you, Iâm talking about the 2-4 players at the Borgata, a game which is notoriously soft, even for AC games, not the 30-60 game at the Bellagio.  Itâs a bit like saying "hey Iâm smarter than the other 9 fish at this .50-1 table on Party", but you still need the confidence in yourself to say that, and then to execute.  To be confident in your game, you have to be confident in yourself first.  Poker will follow.  Be able to know yourself enough to keep firing when youâre catching cold cards, know yourself enough to know when itâs time to stand up from the table, know yourself enough to know you wonât beat that maniac on your right.  That is what makes a winning player more than knowing when to lay down an open-ended straight draw when another overcard comes on the turn.  Thereâs a pretty good Oracle of Delphi reference to be made here, I just canât come up with it right now.  There have been some  urlLink very good   urlLink posts  lately about confidence and knowing yourself at the poker table that are infinitely better than this.  Youâd do yourself well to read them and take them to heart.  It will make all the difference in the world in your game.   Set your VCRs for ESPN   Best of luck to both  urlLink Iggy  and  urlLink HDub , who are out to Vegas this weekend, not necessarily looking to get into the WSOP Main Event, but I wouldn't be surprised to see at least one of them in it this year.  Also, congrats to  urlLink Felicia  for her performance in the Razz event and satellite for the WSOP.  She tried to avoid the ESPN cameras at all costs, but maybe they got her in a heads-up hand with Howard Lederer, and she'll end up on the broadcast.

       Now that Iâve returned from the ether, and now that Iâve deleted four months of posts with seemingly no explanation, I think it would be good to write about why all of that has happened.  I know a few of you were curious as to why someone would just up and leave with no explanationâ¦why someone would intentionally destroy 4 months of work for no good reason.  Well, there is a very good reason.  Yes, this is only a silly little blog in the middle of the anonymous void that we call the âinternetâ, and people come and go with no explanation every day.  But there comes a point where even silly little things can become detrimental.  Just a word of warning: Iâm not going into particular details about why I did what I did, mainly because theyâre my reasons.  Iâm sure you will be able to speculate generally what happened, and thatâs fine by me.  The details, you donât need to know.  At any rate, I couldnât have picked a worse time to start a hobby, much less two.  I know itâs a bit clichÃ© by this point, but when Rounders came out in 1998, I was bitten by the poker bug.  I had seen and always enjoyed watching ESPN when they would (rarely) show their footage from the WSOPs and, despite not seeing hole cards, still found it compelling to watch.  In 1998 I was a senior in college, quite poor and never seriously played cards in my life.  But I knew I wanted to.  I started reading about poker, not seriously, but casually, and always thought it would be an interesting hobby to have.  I was poor however, and keep my hobby to myself mostly.  So I came back home after graduating, got married, got a job, and was still poor.  Not poor per se, but still without that disposable income needed to really play poker or to even learn more about it.  A few more years went by and nothing really came of it.  Then the WPT came on the scene and it really caught my eye.  By this time, I had been married almost 3 years, my wife and I were doing well enough and I decided that I wanted to try playing poker.  So I took a few rides down to Atlantic City and played.  Nothing serious, just 2-4 at the Taj.  I mostly lost.  I was a horrible horrible fish.  Online poker was there, but never appealed to me.  For my money, poker was about sitting around a table and socially playing cards, not about making cash or beating fish all over the place and stealing their rolls.  But I wanted to be a better player, so I started to read more, become more serious.  I also had a lot of thoughts in my head about poker and about life in general that I wanted to write down, but didnât really have an outlet.  I always felt an urge to blog, but before poker, never had something compelling to write about, from my perspective.  In October 2003, my first son was born.  It was the best day of my life, hands down.  Things were going great, if tiring.  Why I picked this time in my life to âget seriousâ about playing poker, or about blogging, Iâll never know.  But I did. I started playing online and blogging.  And, slowly but surely, it began to take a toll on things that, quite frankly, are a million times more important than this silliness.  I didnât go on massive tilt and lose my bankroll (and then some), as I would imagine is the Number One reason for poker ruining peopleâs lives.  In fact, over the four months that I started playing online, I was a  winning  player.  It was the timeâ¦it became to easy to do.  So I did the only thing I could think of at the time that would keep me sane, and thatâs to walk away in the harshest of manners.  Itâs for the best, though.  Things in my life are returning to where they need to be.  Despite that, however, I missed the writing too much.  I enjoyed thinking about poker, and writing about it, and reading the rest of the conventional wisdom being pounded out every day by the rest of the Great Poker Thinkers.  So here I am again, thinking and writing, despite my playing being severely lessened.  I am not playing online anymore, and I doubt I ever will again. Nothing against those that play online, as I know most of the bloggers out there do, but Iâd rather use my poker bankroll to play live.  But I am still thinking, still writing.  I figure that I am back now to the same point in my life where I was about a year ago, just a little bit wiser. And thatâs just fine with me.   Final Words of Thanks   Thanks to everyone for the kind welcome back that I've gotten.  The sense of community is probably the strongest draw to bring me back to writing again.  urlLink Hdouble ,  urlLink Iggy ,  urlLink Felicia ,  urlLink Al ,  urlLink Maudie ,  urlLink Monte Christo  and anyone else I have missed, thanks again. It means a lot.

       I live very close to Philadelphia in South Jersey and, as such, have suffered horribly at the hands of the Philadelphia sports teams (Flyers nothwithstanding, mainly because I refuse to root for them. For hockey, I prefer the Devils).  However, the Smarty Jones Hype Machine is in full effect around here.  Sports talk radio (what I use to pass the time some people call work) is full of people talking about something only very people really pay attention to: horse racing.  This isn't to denigrate  urlLink anyone's hobby , and I enjoy watching a race just as much as the next person, but the people here need to calm down.  The latest sign of insanity comes, however, from the City Council in Philly.  They have  approved  that if Smarty Jones wins the Belmont, they'll consider having a freaking parade for him! A parade? Are people in this town  that  hard up for a champion that they'll have a parade for a freaking horse?  Seriously.  Calm down, wait for the Phillies or Eagles to win (both of which are seriously realistic this year) and have a parade for creatures that will actually recognize what you're doing.  If Smarty wins (and I certainly hope he does...it will be a hell of a story), then celebrate the way some Philly fans already do: Get completely shitfaced. You certainly don't need a parade as an excuse to do that.  PS: If you're new to the Philly area, and are looking for a tutor in how to enjoy being drunk, I know of a  urlLink good tutor .

        This is a post that I always meant to write the first time around, but now that Iâve committed cyber hari-kari, this is as good a time as ever to explain why I named my blog what I did and exactly what the hell it has to do with playing poker.   At its core, anisotropy is a scientific term that I came to know during my education in physics and chemistry.  Essentially, it describes a system whose properties differ based on the direction being considered and your position when viewing the item.  For my education, most times we were dealing with crystal lattices of material, discussing mechanical properties of different elements.  Based on the crystal structure, the elements involved and how they bond to each other, a material may be anisotropic.  The best example is concrete, which is a wonderful material when you are considering its use in compression (bridge supports, for example).  However, if you were to use concrete in a tensile application, it would crumble and fold like me at a table full of rocks.  When I began my excursion into the world of poker and started doing some reading on the subject, people constantly talked about position.  What is your position at the table? How does your stack compare, in position, with the other stacks?  To me, it made perfect sense.  Poker is clearly an anisotropic game.  Your actions, your properties at the table are dependent heavily upon your position, relative to the button and relative to stack size.  Understanding that, understanding how to use that information to your advantage is probably the single biggest weakness of the fish, even beyond making âbad callsâ.    Yes, constantly playing crappy cards will cause anyone to go bust, no matter what position youâre sitting in.  But I think that teaching the fish not to play crappy cards is considerably easier than teaching a fish about the power of position, how to play marginal hands in late position or (in a NL environment) how to use your large stack to your advantage.  I know that, for me, once I understood those topics, I really started to feel like I was starting to understand the game, and starting to become a poker player, instead of a guy sitting at a poker table.

       ...to the show that never ends.  Actually, I'm back. The guy you (used to) know and love, and read with semi-regularity, if only to laugh at his attempts to sound profound and/or interesting, is here.  Severely changed, kinda pissed that I deleted all that profundity from earlier, but back nonetheless. I'll post more later, things have changed, but all for the best.

       When I was in high school, I played football.  In a small school like mine (34 people in my graduating class), if you had decent size or speed, you were automatically recruited to the football team.  My high school just started their football program in 1989, 2 years before I started high school and, needless to say, we sucked.  I suffered through two years of it where we went 3-6 my freshman year and 1-8 my sophomore year (we scored 3 touchdowns all year long. We rocked).  After that, my coach was unceremoniously fired and this new coach was brought in.  He kinda knew what he was doing.  Things started looking up.  His biggest change to the program was year-long weight room requirements, unless you played another sport during the year.  I was decent enough in the weight room by my junior year, benching about 275 and squatting around 550, not bad for a lineman, and lifting weights, no matter how much you love it, gets ungodly and tedious after a while.  So I decided to play a spring sport to break the monotony.  I am perhaps the worst baseball player in the history of man, so thatâs out. Linemen donât usually translate well into playing tennis, so thatâs a no-go.  I love golf and all, but my typical round usually consists of building at least 2 snowmen per side (a score of 8 on one hole) and my high school has one of the best golf programs in the state, so that left the most logical choice: track (or more specifically, field. Shot put and discus).  The track program at my school started my sophomore year and I took part in it, mainly because the other guys on the line were doing the same.  However, we didnât have a real throwing coach (he was along the lines of âHereâs the shot, go have funâ school of coaching), so I didnât intend on going back.  But now faced with sitting in a humid, somewhat rank weight room for 2 hours a day, the track program looked inviting.  So back out to the field I went.  Our coach that year decided to start taking things a little more seriously.  We actually started to work on technique to make us semi-respectable.  I was still struggling to reach 40 feet.  It was my major goal for the year to throw 40 feet in a meet.  I thought that was actually pretty good.  Then we went to Bridgeton.  Bridgeton High School was, hands down, the best track program in our conference and in South Jersey that year.  They had the best runners, the best throwers and the best facilities Iâd ever seen at a high school.  By comparison, most of the meets we went to at schools had cinder tracks or sometimes asphalt.  Bridgeton has one of those composite tracks that you see at D1 colleges.  We get off the bus and itâs immediate intimidation.  Hell, Iâm sure their shoes and uniforms cost more than our hurdles and javelins.  I still was feeling OK and thought that I would be able to at least place at the meet.  Shot put is one of the first events of the competition, so we make our way over to the circle.  We warm up a bit, and then they come over.  The other team has already warmed up before, so I donât get to see them in action before we start.  I decide to slot myself as the first guy up, because I hate waiting around and just want to get it over with.  I step in the circle, clear my mind and try to concentrate on my legs and hips and getting everything together in one motion.  I glide across the circle and launch my first throw.  It looked pretty good, but only went 38 -10.   Okay, not bad , I tell myself.   You have two more throws, and 39 feet may be good enough to get 3rd or steal 2nd.  Then he steps in the circle.  His name is Ray Wilks. I vaguely remember playing against him when we played Bridgeton in football.  He was a linebacker.  To look at him, heâs not much at all.  Slightly taller than I was, maybe 6 feet at the most.  Weight 180 soaking wet on a good day.  He settles into the circle, rests the shot comfortably in the crook of his neck, and settles in.  But somethingâs not right. He looks like heâs going to throw a discus, not a shot.  Maybe he doesnât know what event heâs in.  I think about stopping him before I realize. He knows exactly what heâs doing.  He spins across the circle like an Olympic shot putter and throws the 12 pound ball of steel like itâs made of Styrofoam.  When it finally comes down and they measure it, 56-4, I know that I really donât have a clue what Iâm doing.  Then I get a little angry.  How can this little guy, who I could probably break in half on a football field, absolutely destroy me throwing a little ball like that? Doesnât he know I can squat 550 lbs? Thatâs like 4 of him.  After I calm down, which doesnât take long, as my next throw goes out of bound and doesnât count (even though itâs nowhere close to 40 feet and Iâm all out-of-whack) I begin to realize.  You can have all the talent/strength/knowledge/raw ability in the world.  Itâs the technique, stupid.  Donât try and fool yourself otherwise.  I finally realized that I donât even know what I donât know, and that there are a million things that Iâll never begin to comprehend.  I finally understood why the âfavoriteâ (usually the guy/team that looks better on paperâ¦the entity with the better raw stats) doesnât always win.  I learned that talent does not directly translate to success, if you donât know the right way to apply the talent.  So I tried to work on my technique as much as I could.  I never did throw 40 feet my junior year, but my senior year I finally got to throwing around 42 feet.  I never beat Bridgeton in any meets, in fact I never placed against them, but I started to hold my own against other opponents.  I thought I was doing pretty decently again.  I started to feel more confident in myself my senior year.  And then I went to an invitational meet where I got to throw the discus against Ron Dayne. Yes, that Ron Dayne, the Heisman winning Ron Dayne.  New Jersey State record holder for the discus Ron Dayne. And my education started all over again.  But thatâs another story.

       I thought I had this all out of my system but then I go to ESPN to read some NFL information (the one thing they still do right) and I am assaulted by this nonsense.  There are two other articles there today as well (Lovinger's Is Poker A Sport? I still want to know why that matters at all and one by Glazer concerning Poker Superstars, which is mildly interesting to people with zero poker exposure), but this one by my favorite "sportswriter" to bash, just takes the cake. From the article:    Then it happened. First-timer Chris Moneymaker came out of nowhere to win the 2003 World Series. This could never happen in any other sport. You won't see the Lakers pluck someone from the stands to run the point against the Pistons. The mystique was gone. After Moneymaker, everyone realized the same thing: to play poker, you needed ... a wallet. Watch some shows, read some books, play a few hands on the Internet, throw on a pair of crummy sunglasses, and you're ready to roll.    I can't begin to rip this one apart. Is that really all it takes to play poker? I was unaware that it was so easy.  I suppose I should want this myth to perpetuate, as it will just keep on bringing the crappy-ass fish to the tables, but I just can't stand people with a passing understanding of the game watering it down.  After all, isn't playing golf just buying some clubs, a few balls, a glove and some spiky shoes?  Maybe. But all you'll have at the end is an empty box of balls, a broken driver and a sunburn.  This next section really gets me though:    In the recently completed World Series, the number of entrants nearly tripled. Everyone was banking on a puncher's chance of becoming the next Moneymaker. My buddy Sal entered this year for a segment on "Jimmy Kimmel Live." He figured he'd get knocked out in a couple of hours. The sum of his poker experience? Three weeks on the Internet, three books and six tutorials in Vegas right before the tournament. That's it. He ended up hanging on for three full days, cracking the final 500, outlasting all of those authors and tutors. And he was wearing a pair of Elton John-style sunglasses to boot.   "It's all about luck," a surprised Sal said later. "Once you know what you're doing, it's all about luck."    Again, I suppose I should be saying "Please come sit here on my left. I have an empty chair waiting for you", but I can't. Surviving into the top 500 in a tournament with 2500 people, one time? It is all about luck at that level, stupid. Please try doing that again and again, ad nauseum. I'm willing to wager that if he enters next year, he's out on day 1. Variance is a bitch like that, and I guess what really gets me is that it is completely ignored when these people talk about poker.  The short-term is emphasized, variance is ignored and everyone thinks they are Mike McD. I hope these posts go away soon. I'm so tired of bitching.  To the three people that came back to read this when I returned from hiatus, I really apologize for the level of curmudgeonly whining that has been taking place.  Not playing online has afforded me the luxury of actually paying attention to what the media is saying about something poker, a game (yes a game, not a sport. BFD.)  And, on my own behalf and on behalf of those that don't need or want to see poker dumbed-down anymore, I say to Simmons, Lovinger, et al., please shut up.  I'm sure there's a Red Sox column that needs writing.

       Iâm looking forward to seeing the 2004 WSOP coverage.  [Editorâs note: Yes, Iâm aware itâs on ESPN, and my anti-ESPN sentiment from the previous post still exists.  Hereâs to hoping they donât completely screw it up, in which case Iâll be completely done with them.]   Iâm especially interested in seeing the other tournaments besides the Main Event, mainly because I have had zero exposure to those games, and would love to learn about them, if only superficially.  I played Omaha once, never played 7-card stud and didnât even know what Razz was until I was talking with  urlLink Felicia  one night and asked (itâs 7-card lowball, although Iâm pretty sure Iâm the last one to learn that).  I think that exposure to the âotherâ forms of poker, recently neglected like that weird uncle that nobody really talks to and smells like pipe tobacco, will help us stave off the overexposure of NLHE.  Admittedly, to the common observer, NLHE is probably much more exciting than, say, Limit Razz or PL Omaha 8.  However, for the poker junkie (yes, you), watching poker is always interesting, especially if itâs not something youâve seen before.  I think it will bring a balance back to card games being run in the casinos as well.  Right now, if you walk into a card room with 20 tables, there are probably at least 15 of them running HE, maybe 2 or 3 Stud tables and a few Omaha tables.  The other games (in AC, at leastâ¦I have no knowledge of whatâs going on in Vegas or CA cardrooms) are effectively dead in the casinos.  Everyone and their grandmother (literally) want to play HE.  I also think that, for the poker junkie, exposure to a new game expands our knowledge base.  And in this game, knowledge is power.  Itâs like playing chess.  A basic player knows how to play white with standard opening book moves and they can progress only so far.  But learning unorthodox strategies, learning how to play black, etc, only brings more knowledge and power, making them a better (and more dangerous) player.  While not exactly a true analogy (PL Omaha strategy is completely different from Limit Razz, etc.), I think that any additional knowledge about a subject makes you more dangerous because you understand more. And once you understand the fundamentals, you can begin to manipulate them and make more advanced plays.  And you progress down the road to becoming a winning player âin the long term.â

       Wow.  It really seems like I updated this thing just a few days ago.  And I really meant to update it more frequently than I have been, itâs just that I came across a few of  urlLink Iggy âs new posts, and well, Iâve been digging myself out from under the enormity of those for the last week and a half.  Seriously, if youâve come here looking for hardcore poker playing content, I would point you to the links on the right, where there are people who actually still play poker on a semi-regular basis and whose insights are a million times more profound than mine.  More to the point, I havenât been updating recently because my life has been more than full with other things to occupy my time.  As I may or may not have mentioned, I have been looking for another job, as Iâm really not happy where I currently am.  Iâve been at my job for 5 years, and itâs the first job I had out of college.  Iâve absorbed all the knowledge I can from here, and there is very nearly zero chance for me to advance (intellectually or career-wise), not to mention the fact that the management have begun to resemble the âDilbert PHB (pointy-haired boss)â Syndrome that makes me want to run for the hills.  Plus, who doesnât want a pay raise?  But more importantly than that, my family time has dramatically increased, which is good.  My son is nearly 8 months old now, and is actually getting to the point where he does more than just lay there, stare at you blankly, smile vaguely, scream, shit and sleep.  He can sit up, is teething, makes gibberish noises at Vince Van Patten (this is proof that infants are the only ones who find VVP intelligible) and is attempting desperately to crawl.  My brother is getting married next weekend, and Iâm the best man, so that has also taken an inordinate amount of time, albeit fun time.  I couldnât convince his fiancÃ©e him to go to Atlantic City for his bachelor party last weekend, so we settled on driving to nearly every club in Philadelphia and getting completely a little drunk.  In retrospect, itâs probably better we didnât hit AC anyway, as I am the only one in the group that was going that would play poker.  I canât convince anyone else that it is interesting.  They would rather play craps (somewhat acceptable, even though dice are inherently evil), or even worse, Let It Ride (vomit).  And really, what kind of bachelor party is it if the best man disappears 5 minutes into it to go sit at a soft 3/6 table at the Borgata?  So, really, there will be a more substantive post coming soon, maybe even with some honest-to-goodness poker content!  Until then, Iâll just be reading the other great blogs out there, and my newly picked up Super/System.

       Okay, I'll admit it:  I hate ESPN .  Really.  It's okay, you can breathe.  Can we go on? Do you need more air? Okay. Let's proceed.  Now that we've gotten all the hyperbole out of the way, I seriously have major issues with ESPN, and am fully convinced now that they are the sole ruination of sports as we know it.  They have sucked all the fun out of sports like only a giant soulless Disney-owned corporation can.  Do we need evidence? Okay, here we go.  Exhibit A: The NBA.  Nothing has destroyed the wonderful league that was the NBA like SportsCenter.  If I were David Stern, I would want to bomb Bristol, CT back to the Stone Ages.  In the 80s and early 90s, the game was still watchable and there were still very good players and very good teams. Then, the early to mid 90s brought us the SportsCenter boom.  Games were hyped out of proportion.  Individual performances were praised by sycophantic announcers, and pretty soon, kids didn't care about the games. They cared about the highlights. To  urlLink borrow a phrase : "Oh the humanity!"  It was the beginning of the end.  Now the league is filled with teams with 1 mediocre player who thinks he is a superstar making a max contract and a bench filled with players who were lucky to be "Second Team All-MAAC" or some other dubious honor.  (The exception that proves the rule, however, is the Lakers, where the league has ruled the Phil Jackson, Lucifer Incarnate, is allowed to do what he pleases and sign anyone that knocks on his door begging for a ring.)  You don't need to look further than your own local teams to see the insanity that ESPN has brought the NBA.  A league where a player like Kenny Thomas makes $50 million needs to be reevaluated. (Note: If you don't know who Kenny Thomas is, that doubly proves my point).  Exhibit B: Page 2 (and now by extension, Page 3). I'll admit, when Page 2 first started, I read it and thought it was interesting.  Now, the people they have writing for that nonsense are caricatures of themselves.  They now believe their own hype, and it's only going to get worse. There's nothing worse in this world than a sportswriter that believes his own press.  And now, there's a whole staff of them at ESPN.  And they get free web-space and airtime (here's to hoping Woody Paige, Jay Mariotti and Michael Wilbon all get stuck in an elevator for 3 days and everything just sorts itself out).  And don't forget the "Sports Guy". Ugh. I can pick up the sports page and write his column any day of the week. Are you ready? "Oh no! The   just lost again and broke my heart. Where's   when you need him? The '86 Celtics were great. Boo freaking hoo."  Single handedly responsible for the Boston "oh we're horrible victims of fate" blubbering that is prevalent around this country.  Exhibit C: Jay freaking Lovinger.  Do I really need to elaborate on this?  Yet another example of hopping on something that is actually cool and interesting (poker) and making it inane, vapid, soulless and mind-numbingly boring.  The next time there is a Poker Bloggers Tournament, I would love for someone to invite him to come and play.  By reading his "column" I am fully convinced that he's a guy whose read a few books and really has no clue what he is doing, much less talking about.  In order to bring an end to this, I will be offering a bounty to the person that permanently busts Lovinger, takes every last cent of his poker bankroll, and mercifully ends that crap he posts weekly.  If you can do this, or know someone who can,  urlLink email  me and we'll talk.  Okay, I really don't mean to sound so horribly negative, or come across as a "Get off my damn lawn you damn kids!" type, but I just get irked by things like that.  I enjoyed sports.  Now the only sport worth watching anymore is football (the last thing that ESPN has yet to ruinâ¦don't give them any ideas).  I love poker, and I hate to see it being presented in such a horrible, horrible way to people who view ESPN as some sort of authority voice on sports.  I hate to think of someone interested in poker picking up Lovinger's column to read and thinking that is really what poker is all about.  Maybe I just need to start drinking again.  That might just help.  Or if you have a map to Bristol and anarchistic tendencies, that might help as well.

       There is an interesting piece on  urlLink Slate  about this year's WSOP and how there is a potential for a huge decline in interest soon.  I especially liked these paragraphs:   Harrah's Entertainment, which bought the rights to the World Series from Binion's Horseshoe last year, certainly doesn't mind the Hold 'Em boom. The company expects 6,000 players next year and plans to move early rounds to the glitzier Rio, near the strip. The World Series may be the most prestigious and highest-paying tournament in poker, but ESPN made it a must-see event. But the network, which will begin televising this year's World Series next month, may have made a losing bet.  These days, every channel has a poker show. They all have those lipstick cameras that offer peeks at the players' hole cards and promise the nervy suspense that comes with an all-in bet. But Bravo's Celebrity Poker Showdown has witty celebs. The Travel Channel's World Poker Tour includes the game's bestâor at least most famousâplayers duking it out in fancy resorts. The World Series, then, offers the big bucks and the idea that "anyone can win." Anyone can win, though, is less exciting than it sounds. In sports, it's fun to root for the underdog because of the small chance that he can knock off a superstar. But when anyone can win becomes anyone always wins, you're just left looking for a familiar face .  I apologize for the lack of posting recently, but a lot of things have taken my time away, including searching for a new job, not unlike  urlLink Mean Gene  (except my search is voluntary...sorry Geno).  I'll be back posting on a more regular basis soon...

           I feel like Iâm finally starting to get into the groove of learning once again.    Only this time, instead of concentrating on learning limit, I am learning NL, which is a completely different animal.    So, my education has to start over at square one again.    Sure, the concepts like pot odds, implied pot odds and the like are the same.    However, the calculations are not as straightforward, nor the decisions as easy.                   I know weâve all heard the clichÃ© at one time or another: âIn limit, you play the cards. In no-limit, you play the man.â I never really understood exactly what that meant until I actually played both and saw it firsthand. In limit, the cards and the pot odds are what dictate your betting, and whether you stay in a hand or not.    If the pot is large enough, itâs nearly impossible to drive anyone off of a hand, because they will most likely always be getting the right odds to draw out on you.    Who they are or what kind of player they are takes a less prevalent (but still important) role.                   In no-limit, your position and your betting makes all the difference in the world.    The other thing you always hear about is, âItâs easier to make a bet with a marginal hand than it is to call a betâ.    Being the first one to fire at the pot sometimes is all you need to take it down.    You just have to be sure that the people you are betting into will actually respect it and lay down marginal hands.    This is virtually impossible in limit, especially at the micro limits, where people will call one bet to draw to a 4 outer.                   The most surprising aspect of this transition to no limit for me has been the fact that I have become a tighter player.    I would have thought, at the beginning, that the opposite would have been true.    I thought that because the variance would be greater (which it is), that I would be seeing more flops (which Iâm not).    I have learned how to lay down hands that I thought were âgoodâ, but only second or third best.    Now I still donât always do these things, but at least I am beginning to realize what is necessary to take the next step to becoming a winning player.                   Thatâs another interesting question that I think a lot of people donât distinguish between.    Do you want to be a âgoodâ poker player, or a âwinningâ poker player?    I think there is a difference that people try to make, albeit a subtle one, and itâs something that trips up a lot of players on their paths to enlightenment.                   Iâm sure it all depends on what your definitions of âgoodâ and âwinningâ are, since these are purely subjective terms.    Iâm sure there are those people that will argue that if you are a good player, correctly calling when you have the odds, laying down when you donât, following the established theories, that the winning will follow, and that being âgoodâ and âwinningâ are the same thing.    But I think there are those people who will get blinded with the obsession of being a âgoodâ (textbook) player and will pass up profit, or actually cost themselves money, playing in a game for which the theory was never intended.    They think they are a good player, but they are not a winning    player at that point.    Their game selection for their skill set is not appropriate, and it costs them money and time while they yell about âall the horrible fishâ.                       If you are going to play in the bloodbath 2-4 or 3-6 games, where loose-aggressive is the norm, and the variance is through the roof, then expect some suckouts.    Expect soul-crushing beats.    Adapt your game to suit your surroundings and punish these people with the premium hands.    If you sit down and notice that the table is full of passive rocks, then loosen up a bit.    Again, adapt, survive and flourish.    Learn all the theory that you can, it can only help you.    But the real wisdom is in the correct application of the right theory at the right time.    That is being a âgoodâ player.    Then, the winning will follow.                   ---------                   And now, for some blog pimping, something I have not done in a very long time.    Mostly, I donât want to leave anyone out and hurt feelings.    There are so many blogs to read these days that I feel like that is my part-time job.    I try to keep current with my blog listings over here on the right, and all of the ones I have listed are the ones I check out (several times) every day.    If youâre not reading them (and you probably are, since you got to my site from one of theirs, most likely), then youâre doing yourself a disservice.    Head on over there, and check out all the great writing (poker and non-poker alike) that these people are putting out on a regular basis. Youâll probably get more insight there than you do here, better writing for sure, and itâs just a hell of a lot of fun.                   That being said, Iâm linking up another blog (this brings the list to 20, which I think is a good place to stop for now) who has been kind enough to write about my blog and how much he enjoys it.    I enjoy his blog as well, even if he did leave me off his Top Ten Blogs list (had to get that one in).    And just when you thought there wasnât a name more odd than Lord Geznikor Whompbucket, I find  urlLink SirFWALGMan .    Heâs from     Boston     (we wonât hold that against him) and is doing well at the 1/2 tables at Empire (although I hear heâs thinking of moving to the $25NL).    Check him out.                   Thanks for stopping by to read! Anisotropy will probably be dormant until Monday because I am flying back to     New   Jersey     tomorrow and the weekend will be for, um, recuperating. Until thenâ¦

           Actual. Poker. Content.    Ever since my indoctrination to the world of NL cash games last week at HP, I have been feasting on the juicy $25NL tables at Empire (sign up  urlLink here : Code ANI77. End shill.).     They are a very easy game to play.    Very passive tables, not much preflop raising and will often fold to pot sized bets on the flop, unless you get a maniac.    All you really need to do is to wait for a decent hand (even TPTK will do) and you can make some good coin.    Over the last week, Iâve managed to take this game for close to $200, which is basically all of my winnings for the month.                   I started playing poker again on July 1.    I started back small at the .50/1 tables, relearning everything Iâd forgotten (which wasnât much since I didnât know all that much to begin with).    I built back up and then with a seriously short roll, thought I would sit $1-$2 for a while.    The players were just as bad as the $0.50-$1 players, just with more money.    Again, I didnât make much progress at all, just treading water, waiting to make a move.    Then I got sent on my 2-week hiatus here to the     Left        Coast    , and everything changed.                   I have never been one to play NL, except in the few blogger tourneys and the occasional SNG.    I had tried to stay focused on learning the limit game first before trying to wrap my arms around NL.    After playing both now (albeit for a very short time), I find that, at this point, I prefer NL.    I feel more comfortable there and I donât feel like I am playing badly.    Itâs easier for me at NL to understand the pot odds and to get away from questionable hands.    In limit, especially the no fold-em games, it is tough to release questionable hands, because you are often getting huge odds to check-call down to the river, only to miss your draw.    In NL, I find itâs easier to fold those hands because the odds are often never in your favor that way.    Someone makes a pot sized bet, itâs easy to get rid of that second pair, good kicker with a backdoor flush draw.                   Anyway, this has been my best month since Iâve started playing, and I feel like I can only move up the ladder from here.    To that end, Iâm going to start to read more.    Books can only help, right? Therefore, Iâm taking suggestions on what I should read next. I have read, to date: Jones and Carson.    Good enough for the no-foldâem games I was playing, but now I feel like I want a little more.    Is it Sklansky time yet? Let me know.

                  Yesterday was the NFC, my favorite conference.    Today is the AFC, which I, admittedly, pay less attention to.    Things here may not be as insightful, but Iâll take a stab at it.    How hard can it be?                    AFC West                 San        Diego       Chargers   : Phillip Rivers is a good      pick-up.    Tomlinson is still one of      the best backs in the league.    But thatâs about where it ends. Trading David Boston and adding Kevin Dyson may be good for the locker room, but itâs definitely a subtraction on the field.    And when you release 7 offensive linemen in one year, donât expect what you put on the field to be all that cohesive or good.    This      team will struggle, yet again, and be in the running for another No. 1      pick in the 2005 draft.         Oakland            Raiders:    This teamâs      not much better.    Iâm pretty sure      the average age of starters on this team is like 72.    Kerry Collis is a (small) improvement      over Gannon, and     Robert       Gallery     will probably make a good impact on      the OL.    Sapp and Washington add about 800 pounds of mass in the middle of the DL, which can only improve the weak Raiders defense.    But they      still donât have a running game. Troy Hambrick? I donât think so.    Theyâll improve, but not much. 8-8 is an      achievable goal.         Denver            Broncos:    The Clinton      Portis Era is over.    Now all eyes      will be on Jake Plummer.    This is an interesting move for this team, whose fans claim that Shannahanâs system makes it easy for any RB to get 1,000 yards.    Champ Bailey is a good DB, but I donât      think I would have given up Portis for him.    The retirement of Sharpe also will prove      to be a challenge.    Overall,      however, I still think they have more than any other team in this division,      including the Chiefs.    Look for this      team to get 10-11 wins, and probably the division         Kansas        City       Chiefs:    Last yearâs favorite will become      this yearâs exposed fraud.    Not to      say this team is horrible, but they have zero defense.    Unless you want to count Vermeilâs      crying as a defense.    They really      did nothing to improve themselves in the off-season, and that will prove      to be costly.    Teams that last year ran over this defense will have an even better idea of how to do it this year, especially with a new coordinator and the same personnel.    Of course, this offense will still win      quite a few games.    But in the      clutch, when it counts, theyâll come up short again.    Wild Card.                      AFC North                 Cleveland            Browns:    Nothing      makes me happier than to see a     University    of    Miami     coach fail in the NFL.    And goodbye Tim Couch. Hello Jeff      Garcia.    Thatâs probably a wash,      since Garcia is still a serviceable QB, but on the downside.    Of course all the hype is over another      Hurricane, Kellen Winslow Jr. This kid is  not  his dad. Heâs not even Jeremy Shockey, who is also a      fraud.    Heâll be a decent TE in the      league, but not the savior of the franchise.    This team will continue to be what it      always was: mediocre. No more than 6-7 wins.         Pittsburgh            Steelers:    I have      never seen a town more in love with their coach than     Pittsburgh    .         Which is sometimes a good thing, but Cowher? I suppose bringing a team to the Super Bowl gets you the Chuck Noll Free Pass for Life.    Overall, however, they just havenât      added enough to be an impact.    Duce      Staley will be OK for them.    But      they released their only half-decent defensive player.    Another struggling year for the      Steelers.         Cincinnati            Bengals:    This team      should just put a big question mark on their helmets, because I donât know      anyone that can figure them out.    You      never know which Bengals team is going to show up to play week to      week.    Marvin Lewis knows how to prepare a team, and that is good, but trading Corey Dillon, no matter how unhappy he was, may prove to be the Achilles heel for the team.    But, if Rudi Johnson can be âgood enoughâ, and Lewis can get the defense to play âgood enoughâ, then the âBunglesâ may just compete again for a Wild Card spot, and just be âgood enoughâ to get it.         Baltimore            Ravens:    Ray Lewis.      Nuff said. The most dominant defensive player in the league is the heart      and soul of this team.    Not getting      Terrell Owens hurt, but Kevin Johnson will add some life into this      offense.    Unfortunately, they still      have no QB to speak of, and who knows what will happen to Jamal      Lewis.    Brian Billick (aka Egomaniac Extraordinaire) will be able to get this team to 10-11 wins, which is more than enough to win this division.         But donât take it too easy, or     Cincinnati     may just surprise you.                      AFC South                 Houston            Texans:    This is perhaps      the most interesting division in the NFL.    Also itâs one of the toughest.        Houston     is a promising team with a promising      QB and decent draft picks.    They are      young and talented.        Davis     is turning out to be a good RB and the defense has improved, especially on the DL and through the draft of Dunta Robinson.    Unfortunately, they      are still in the same division with     Tennessee     and Indy.    I think that, if all goes right however, this team will be second in the division, and 9 wins isnât out of the question. Playoff spot? Donât be surprised.         Jacksonville            Jaguars:    Byron Leftwich notwithstanding, this team has nothing to speak of, except the head coach putting axes in the locker room for people to maim themselves with.    Another struggling year for a      good QB on a crappy team.    They      finish in the cellar, 6 wins at most.         Tennessee            Titans:    Probably the      biggest letdown team in this division.         Losing Eddie George will hurt more off the field than on the field,      and it will hurt on the field.    The      loss of McCareins and Kearse also wonât help the win total for the      year.    And how many more beatings can McNair take, or how many more weeks can he play âhurtâ, or with his left thumb falling off, or whatever.         This team is going to look sadly mediocre, and miss the playoffs.         Indianapolis            Colts:    Itâs the Peyton and Marvin show! But seriously, Peyton Manning *coughturnovermachinecough* and Marvin Harrison are the best tandem in football.    Edgerrin James is coming      off a good year, but is also injury prone.         With this team, this coaching and in this division, thereâs no excuse for anything less than first here. The talent level is just too high.                      AFC East               Buffalo      Bills:    The team with      the best coachâs name (Mularkey. Effin great.) has a tough road ahead of      them this year.    They made some interesting additions to the team over the last few years (Bledsoe, Spikes, Milloy, Vincent) and definitely enough skill in the receivers to be effective.    But there is just      something about this team I donât like.         Something that just strikes me as if they donât really care about      winning.    They are just along for      the ride.    I also donât think that,      after 3 years of struggle, Bledsoe is just going to turn it on and be the      guy he was in    New       England   .     This team has tremendous potential, but      Iâm afraid they will squander it yet again. 7-9.         New        York       Jets:    The return of Chad Pennington will      mean good things for Herm Edwards and the Jets.    They are very fast on defense, and the drafting of Vilma only adds to that. If they can get the Pennington â Moss connection hooked up and effective early, this team may make a run at returning to the playoffs.    I think      theyâll come up slightly short however, finishing 9-7 and losing out on      some obscure tiebreaker.         Miami            Dolphins:    Ricky,      Ricky, Ricky. What have you done? This is the most cowardly way to retire      that I have ever seen.    Whatâs he      effectively done is screwed the team that was generous to him.    When he got traded to     Miami    , he had a shitty contract with      unattainable incentives.    The      Dolphins ripped it up and gave him a better one.    Now he has retired right before camp,      after the Draft, after all the good free agents have gone.    They are left with Travis Minor and Jay      Fiedler (or AJ Feely!) to spark this offense?    They picked up David Boston (another      headache) to go with their already controversy-riddled locker room.    The defense is still very good, but not      good enough to keep this team above .500.         No real QB + no real running game = nightmare season.    No wonder Marino turned down the GM job.        New       England      Patriots:    The class of the AFC.    And theyâve only improved      themselves.    Itâs really scary to      see this team in action, because theyâre so effective at everything they      do.    Belichick is the master of preparation and the only thing he needs to be worried about is the Super Bowl Letdown, or an injury to Tom Brady (whoâs his backup again? Brock Huard. Just so weâre clear.).    Just like Indy, theyâre in a division that isnât very tough, but they will need to remained focused. If they do, thereâs no reason not to win the division.                     Okay, thatâs about it from the football world.    Feel free to pick apart, debate or destroy my reasonings. Iâd love to hear your perspectives on these teams and what you think will happen.    I just love football and canât wait for the season to start.

           And now, the most boring 3 months of the year are over.    From the end of the NCAA tournament until the start of NFL training camp, there is nothing interesting to watch, sportswise.                       Baseball? Mildly entertaining.             Golf? Iâd rather play it.          NASCAR/F1/Indy/any form of racing? Iâd rather watch bowling.                   And so now, for all the football junkies out there (and you know who you are), I am going to present my Completely Unbiased* View of the NFL for the upcoming season.    Today Iâll break down the NFC, team by team and tomorrow the AFC (else Iâd have a post that would rival Iggyâs, and who really has time for 2 Iggy sized posts in a day?).                    NFC West:              Arizona      Cardinals : New coach. Too many young      (but good) receivers. Who is their quarterback again? Emmitt Smith is      starting at RB? 5 wins is a gift for this team.        San Francisco      49ers : Subtract Garcia. Subtract      Owens. Canât get their franchise LB signed.     Dennis Erickson as your coach? Iâd like      to believe that Barlow and Peterson (if the team can get him in camp) will      make this team respectable, I donât hold much hope for them.    Theyâll struggle to be 8-8.        St. Louis      Rams:     This team is a big question mark.    Obviously, this teamâs success is      defined by how smart their coach is.         His system (or lack thereof) will define their season.    Martz has been called an âoffensive      geniusâ, but Faulk isnât as effective as he once was, and Bulger is still      unproven.    Stephen Jackson may      contribute a little bit here and there, but nothing substantial. Orlando      Pace continues to be a locker room problem.    The post-Lovie Smith defense will be      interesting to see. I still think they win 10 or 11 games and get the      divison.         Seattle      Seahawks:  Last yearâs âsurpriseâ      team wonât be surprising anyone this year.         Matt Hasselbeck? Who made him a good QB? Iâm still not      convinced.    But Darrell Jackson is      good enough, and they have a very stout defense.    Trufant is a good player, and Holmgren      is a proven coach.    But I think      there will be a letdown factor in     Seattle    .         They will struggle to make the playoffs, which theyâll do as a Wild      Card.                      NFC North:              Minnesota      Vikings : Defense like Swiss cheese.      I donât care if you have Randy Moss and Culpepper.    Another new defensive coordinator means      more confusion for an already horrible defense.    For as good as this offense is, and it      can be very impressive, I think the bad defense will overshadow it and      this team will finish at or near the bottom of this division.        Chicago      Bears:     Welcome Lovie Smith. Goodbye to the      Great Slash Experiment. Hello to the Rex Grossman Experiment.    Way too many question marks for this      team to be anything but what they are. The Bears. Theyâll struggle to      repeat last yearâs performance (7-9).        Detroit      Lions : The most improved team in the      NFL.    A very good draft accompanied      by a healthy Charles Rogers and Joey Harrington could actually mean good      things for     Detroit    .         Good additions in the defensive secondary as well.    Is this team ready to win though? Iâm      not sure. I think theyâll be in the hunt for the final Wild Card spot, but      might not get it.        Green Bay      Packers : As much as it pains me to      write this, the Packers are good.    Theyâre      returning most of their team (which is to say: Ahman Green and Brett Favre      are still playing). The defense is still OK (even after Ed Donatell got      fired for the 4th-and-26 miracle in Philly), but a new coordinator always      brings growing pains.    Still, the      talent of the offense is probably enough to bring Green Bay the division      again this year.                      NFC South:              Tampa       Bay      Buccaneers : From Super Bowl      champions to a nightmare of a team? See what winning will do to you? It      corrupts! Seriously, this team is like a chicken with itâs head cut      off.    Brad Johnson is a horrible      quarterback, and is only starting because they couldnât get any good QB      free agents, and Chris Simms is still a year away, but donât be surprised      to see Chris Simms later in the season if it gets out of reach.    Keyshawn for Joey Galloway? I guessâ¦theyâre      both overrated receivers, so itâs a wash. McCardell is arguing. There are      28 new players on this roster, not counting draft picks.    I donât see any good things in this teamâs      future. Donât be surprised to see Gruden jumping ship soon.        New Orleans      Saints:       Didnât really do that much in the      offseason, which is to say theyâre strapping the franchise to the legs of      Deuce McAllister.    Iâm not sold on      Aaron Brooks, and in a division with the Super Bowl Champs, a returning      healthy Mike Vick and when you just had a mediocre season, not doing much      to improve yourself is not good at all.         They still finish ahead of     Tampa     because of Deuce, who is one of the      top 3 backs in the league.        Atlanta      Falcons : Healthy Mike Vick.    Rest of division has been put on      notice.    Even with a new head coach,      Vick is probably worth 4 or 5 wins just on his own.    At least a WC for them, if not the      divison.        Carolina      Panthers:  Oh how the mighty will      fall.    Iâm very certain that      Delhomme will return to human status this year and that teams may have a      better idea of how to contain Stephen Davis, especially with a patchwork      offensive line. Their defense is impressive, especially up front, but      their secondary is still not something Iâm sold on.    This isnât the strongest division to be      playing in, so they have that to their advantage.     They fight with     Detroit     for the last WC spot.                      NFC East:              New York      Giants:  Sorry.    Still not your time.    Brenda Warner + New York Media = at      least something interesting to read about when theyâre losing 35-10.    Eli will look like a lost puppy when he      gets his shot about halfway through.         Still no offensive line.         Linebackers arenât much better, either.    Scraping the bottom for this team.        Washington      Redskins:  Donât get caught up in the      Joe Gibbs Hype Machine.    Never      before have I seen such cowtowing to a coach that has been out of the game      for 12 years.    Letâs not forget they      have Mark Brunell at QB? Patrick Ramsey is sure to be pissed.    Clinton Portis was a nice pickup and      will definitely improve the running game, especially in the Joe Gibbs      scheme, but heâs the only weapon they have.    Itâs not tough to shut down an offense      with only one weapon.    Ask Donovan      McNabb.    I think the only place this      can go is downhill.    Heâs already      been put up on that pedestal (just like Spurrier), and there will be a lot      of hardships for this team this year.         I donât see it ending well.        Dallas      Cowboys:     Still a JV offense.    Eddie George is the savior? Heâll be a      solid back, but donât expect him to shoulder the burden.    Antonio Bryant and Keyshawn Johnson on      the same team? Hillarity will ensue.         Theyâre both â    Leon    â from the Bud commercials. Only      worse. 114 year old Vinny Testaverde as the QB. All of this, plus the Bill      Parcells Bully Factor will start to take a toll on the team and people      will just shut down to him.    They      miss the playoffs and Parcells âretiresâ for the 52nd time.        Philadelphia      Eagles:       Yes, theyâve had the advantage of      playing in a weak division over the last few years.    But, no team in the NFL has won more      games over the last 4 years.         Addition of Owens, Kearse and Dhani Jones are quality pickups.    Letting Bobby Taylor go was a tough      decision (heâs big and a good cover, but soft and weak).    Letting Vincent go was a little easier      (heâs old and lost more than a step).         RB is still a question, as Buckhalter and Westbrook will try to      carry the load.    But this is still      McNabbâs team.    With a weak schedule      and a very good team, there is no reason this team should have any      problems winning the division.                     Okay, thatâs it.    Iâm not touching what will happen to teams in the playoffs because we canât predict the number one factor in all playoff team success: injuries.    How teams handle injuries is the key factor to success in the playoffs, so Iâm not going to address that now.    Maybe in the new year.    But tomorrowâ¦the AFC.

           Iâd like to take a small break out of my normal blogging routine to address the issues that bring some of you to my blog, and to answer your questions.    Google is a powerful tool, but it must be used properly.    This is also an exercise in showing that what I type, while sometimes funny to me or even witty at times, can just look plain freaky when used as search words.                    Question/Issue 1 :  âAnti-ESPN blogsâ .    This one is funny to me because of all the previous ranting I did about how ESPN is the ruination of sports and the NBA in particular.    I feel like Iâve said all Iâm going to say about this, but if you want to search the archives, you can have a good chuckle.                    Question/Issue 2 :  âPaul Phillipsâ âInternet Millionaireâ .    Several of you have come here looking for an internet millionaire, and I can assure you, you have come to the right place.    If you can spot me about $999,000, then Iâll be all set. Otherwise, Paulâs blog is  urlLink here .                    Question/Issue 3 :  âWhat do you think of Gus Hansenâ .    Yes, this is an actual search string someone used to find me.    The fact of the matter is, I donât think about Gus Hansen all that much.    All of his good WPT face-time this year got stolen by other random knuckleheads, especially âE-dogâ. (Random aside: Is it odd to anyone else to hear Mike Sexton calling anyone âdogâ? As in âThatâs my dog.â Whatâs next? Mike in a Lil John video?) So alas, probably no more Gus talk either.                    Question/Issue 4 :  âPat Burrellâ âtight buttâ .    Yes, this one scares me the most.    Writing about how Pat Burrell ripped his pants at a recent Phillies game now tops the List of Things I Most Regret Typing Here.    Hopefully itâs just some lonely woman hoping to catch a glimpse of Pat the Bat, but the line is long, ladies.    Also, heâs dated  urlLink this girl  before, so the bar is quite high.                   Now itâs true that I donât type randomly enough or on a wide enough range of topics to have truly weird searches like   urlLink    San Diego      urlLink  hookers  or  urlLink Wife screwing as a poker prize , and Iâd like to keep it that way.    Although now that Iâve typed them in, Iâm sure my freak search factor will start increasing exponentially. Damnit.

          Presented in no particular order, but listed because Iâm too lazy to write out anything substantial.                   Juicy $25NL tables at      Empire/Party:    Man, these things are      sweet.    I havenât tried out the $50 or $100 NL tables, but if I can consistently triple my buy-in at these tables with minimal risk, I donât think Iâll be moving up to play with the tougher guys any time soon.      Witnessing the power of the hidden      full house.    As I wrote previously,      getting a boat with a low pocket pair can be very profitable because itâs      easier to hide.    Flop comes KK8,      turn is a 2. You have pocket 2s.         This hand will make you a lot of money, so take advantage while you      can.      Learning how to use my stack to my      advantage.    I finally began to see      the light when people said to use your bigger stack to your      advantage.    I donât know how many pots I won because I was unafraid to use my larger stack to buy a pot where I didnât want to get outdrawn on.      Being incredibly lucky.    I donât think I was sucked out on at all      in my live play, except for one mini-suckout.    A short stack went all-in for about $40      when I had my stack around $400.    I      called with AK, and he flipped over the same.    However, he caught 4 hearts on the board      for his flush.    If thatâs the worst      beat I take all day, Iâll take that day every day of the week.      Laying out some beats of my own.    I put some pretty solid beats on a      couple of people while I played, which also helped out my stack.    The worst one was against Henry, when I      had pocket 5s (presto!) and he had AK.         Flop comes 48K.    I bet $20      and he check raised me.    At this point      Iâm almost committed so I resign myself to checking and calling the rest      of the way.    However, I catch runner      runner to get my straight and snap his AK.         I felt slightly bad about it, but then I started stacking my chips      and forgot all about it.      Those responsible for Number 6 have      been sacked.      Quintupling up.    Cashing out for $500 when you buy-in for      $100 is a good feeling.    I highly recommend it for everyone. Of course, I will neglect to mention both times I sat down at $3-$6 and cashed out severely in the red or completely busted.    Yes, we will never speak of      those butcher games again.                     Again like I said, all in all a very profitable and very fun time at HP.    Now I cannot wait to get back to the Borgata soon and put my newfound knowledge to good use.    Until then, youâll be able to find me on the NL tables at Empire.         And now, my brain is empty. Thanks for stopping by!

            Well, while messing around with blogger this morning, I managed to stupidly delete my last post.    Also, because I am of the âstream of consciousnessâ school of blogging, I have failed to keep any of those records, so I am sure that post is hopelessly lost in the ether.    Therefore, I will recap my time at     Hollywood       Park     and attempt to do it justice.                 Overall, I stuck to the NL tables ($100 buyin, $150 rebuy if you bust out, $2-$3 blinds).    I had to rebuy once very early on in the sessions, due to a stupid call when my 2 pair got sank by a straight.    Other than that, however, I played very good tight-aggressive poker.    I didnât draw to hands unless I had the right odds and I didnât try to buy pots with absolute trash (although that did work one time).                   I remember specifically a few hands that worked out very well for me, mostly because the tables I was playing at were extremely passive.    There was hardly any pre-flop raising, and 4-5 people limping in to see the flop most times.    If you happened to pre-flop raise, you were lucky to get a caller.    Most times, you took down the blinds and whatever other limpers got in there.    Anyway, one of my bigger hands was when I was dealt pocket 2s on the button.    The flop comes KK8 and gets checked around.    I try my best not to leap out of my seat when a 2 comes on the turn, filling up my boat.    This time, someone bets out $15, which I raise to $30.    This is early on in my session, so my stack is somewhere around $100, maybe a little less.    Everyone else drops out and the initial bettor calls me.    The river is a blank and I go all in.    He thinks for a second, and then calls me.    I flip up my boat and take down a nice pot, doubling up.                   From there, I start to use my stack to my advantage.    And surprisingly, the table turns into a world of bad players.    My hands, while not totally bad starting hands, hold up unimproved quite a few times to take down a pot.    At least 3 or 4 times, I take down a pot with A or K high, even with other high cards on the board.    Nobody has pairs and they bet small into a large pot, letting me continue to draw and take them down with my monster hands.                   After this, I turn another boat, this time with pocket tens (and 2 Kings on the flop), to bust out another player and run my stack up to around $350. About this time I am starting to relax and finally get comfortable with playing NL, a game that I used to truly be afraid of, with the swings and my meager bankroll.    But I must say that the experiences at the tables over the last week have started to turn me around.    I think I can be aggressive enough at the NL tables to survive.    It is a different world from limit, that is for sure, but it is a world that I am ready to at least start exploring.                   Overall, I cashed out about +$420 to my benefit live, and about +$100 on Empire at the $25NL tables.    My hourly rate live is somewhere around $35/hr, which is respectable I think.    I know, sample size, law of averages, etc. blah blah blah, but I will take this as a good sign and continue to find these passive tables and punish them with an aggressive style.                   Well, I think that I will not have another opportunity to play live before I leave to head back to NJ at the end of this week.    Work has become crazy hectic and I think that Iâm coming down with some sort of California Flu. Maybe itâs a strain that the natives are immune to and they give to travelers to punish us.    All I know is that my stomach is breakdancing inside my body, and thatâs not a good thing.    Maybe the beach and some beer will help me recuperate.    Yes, I think that will do just nicely.

       I will do my best here to channel  urlLink Richard Brodie  in talking about my travel. But please be forewarned that I donât have the stroke that he has to fly first-class or to even drive a halfway decent rental car. The flight out here from Philly wasnât bad except that it was too damn early, especially for flying out to the West Coast. Getting up at 5:30 AM is a bitch when you land at LAX and find out you still have half a day of work to get done. After waiting over 90 minutes for my rental car (thanks, Budget!), I find out that they donât even have a full-sized car, like I was supposed to get. They do, however, have a lovely maroon Chevy Malibu, and gave me a free tank of gas on top of it, so I guess I shouldnât really complain.    Some comments about driving in Southern CA for those that havenât had the pleasure. You people need to mark your exits. Seriously. Put numbers on them or something. Just saying âtake the Vermont Ave. exitâ really blows. Nearly everywhere else that Iâve driven, the exits are marked with numbers (exit 38, exit 321, etc.) that are clear and unambiguous. I did manage to find my way to the Hampton Inn in Buena Park, CA (which is *not* Anaheim, as I was told by the guy at the rental placeâ¦even though itâs literally half a mile from âAnaheim City Limitsâ). See? I drive the nice cars, fly first class and stay in the nice hotels, just like Richard Brodie! Okay, not really.    After work, I grabbed some dinner at the Black Angus Steakhouse and had a nice fillet (medium rare) and made sure to put it all on my expense account. Then I took my work-assigned notebook back to the hotel to take advantage of the free âhigh-speedâ internet service. Itâs all wireless, which makes it quite a bit slower than my cable modem at home, but right now free is free, and Iâll take what I can get. However, trying to set up  urlLink Empire  on it last night was a serious pain, and I couldnât get it to fully download for some reason. Perhaps tonight will be more lucky for me and Iâll actually be able to do something interesting in my hotel room instead of watching the 8 channels they offer on TV and calling it âhigh-quality cable TV serviceâ.    Iâm also getting set for my meeting up with the venerable  urlLink Hank , who has graciously offered to show me to the cardrooms in Southern CA. I think weâll probably hit the Commerce, but Iâm leaving it up to himâ¦donât be surprised to read about me at Hollywood Park (which I passed on my way to the hotel), playing $100 NL (only if the game is softâ¦my NL game leaves much to be desired). Iâll be the bald guy in the black Freddie Mitchell jersey, raking the huge pots.

       Okay, I've never posted a hand history before, and this isn't a "bad beat" story to gain sympathy. This is, however, just the hand that best encapsulates my recent stretch of play at the tables. I had a good hand (the nuts, in fact, before the river) and got rivered by a guy who had the right odds to call and caught his 6-outer. Just a hand that everyone comes across in their play, and we have to learn how to deal with in order to become a better player. However, when hands like this become the norm, it just plain sucks.    If you have advice on how I could have better played this hand, leave a comment. I'd love to hear it. Maybe I played it slightly too weak, but I think that's about it.    Party Poker 1/2 Hold'em (9 handed)   Preflop:  Hero is Button with Qd, Jd.      UTG folds, UTG+1 calls, MP1 folds, MP2 folds, MP3 folds, CO folds,  Hero calls , SB completes, BB checks.   Flop:  (4 SB) 8h, Ks, Td  (4 players)   SB bets, BB calls, UTG+1 raises,  Hero calls , SB 3-bets, BB calls, UTG+1 calls,  Hero calls .   Turn:  (8 BB) 9d  (4 players)   SB bets, BB calls, UTG+1 calls,  Hero raises , SB calls, BB calls, UTG+1 calls.   River:  (16 BB) Kh  (4 players)   SB bets, BB calls, UTG+1 calls,  Hero calls .   Final Pot:  20 BB   Main Pot: 20 BB, between Hero, SB, BB and UTG+1.   Pot won by SB (20 BB).   Results below:    SB shows Kc Tc (full house, kings full of tens).    BB shows Qc Qh (two pair, kings and queens).    UTG+1 shows Js Kd (three of a kind, kings).     Hero shows Qd Jd (straight, king high).      Outcome:   SB wins 20 BB.

       Well, this could be my last post for the next two weeks, unless I update over the weekend (highly unlikely). Iâm off to the sunny reaches of Anaheim, CA for two weeks of work (and other activitiesâ¦Iâm sure I can find something to keep myself busy). Before I leave, however, thereâs a couple thoughts that have been floating around that I think would be good to actually write down, lest I forget them like other good ideas Iâve had in the past. [Note to self: start carrying notebook.]    The last time I was talking about a highly unproven theory that I use for selecting tables to play at. It seems to have worked for me better than any other method I used to use for picking what table (average pot size, etc.). Itâs actually pretty simple. When I go to a table, I take a look around. If there are at least 8 players at the table who are below the ârecommendedâ table buyin (25BB), and the other player or two are not massively huge stacks, then I figure the table is pretty easy and have a seat. Now there may be other better ways to pick a table, but my reasoning is this: These players have either a) bought in for 25BBs and have lost some or b) bought in short, which isnât exactly smart either, so this table canât be super tough. The players may be halfway decent, but I should be able to beat this game with these players in it.    This isnât to say if, a few orbits in, someone leaves and another player buys into the game for 100 BBs or more, that Iâll get up and leave. Iâm not intimidated by a big stack at all. But when you first get to a table, you have no way of knowing whether the big stacks bought in that way or built it up at the table. And, quite frankly, with the overwhelming mass of horrible players these days, especially at .50/1 and 1/2, why should I bother trying to figure it out? Thereâs always a bad table just looking for me to sit down there.    Last night at the tables for me was a good exercise in learning how to stay tight when the cards are bad and just wait it out. I sat down at a 1/2 table (BTW, it was nearly impossible to get a full ring 1/2 seat last nightâ¦there were plenty of 6 max tables, but thatâs another story) and started a slow bleed of chips, going down 15BB in the first 45 minutes. I was getting very disgusted. The best thing I saw all night was 99 and had to dump that on the turn when I couldnât get my set. I even lost a pretty decent pot to the set-over-set ballcrusher when I flopped a set of 4s to lose to a flopped set of Ts.    Well, I hung it out and eventually my starting hands improved and so did my flops. I punished a few people that consistently called with second pair or worse and ended the night up 11BBs in just over an hour, which I will take any day of the week. Well, this is a short update, and I may post something before I leave, or when Iâm in Cali next two weeks. But perhaps notâ¦I may be too busy at the tables. We will see.  I almost forgot! I would like to welcome all of those (okay, the one guy) that found Anisotropy by searching for "anti-espn blogs". It warms my heart to see such things.

       I really meant to post this yesterday, but work has been owning my ass.  I am going to be traveling to our Anaheim plant for the next two weeks, so this week gets to be the âhurry up and get done everything I need to do for the next 3 weeksâ week.  Hurray for 10 hour days.  Now if theyâd just pay me overtime...Anyway, on to this weekendâs recap.   Friday night:   A nice quiet night at home with my wife and son.  Went out to our backyard garden, picked some tomatoes, zucchini and cucumbers.  Grilled a few Delmonico steaks, the zucchini and onions, made a simple tomato and cucumber salad, and enjoyed the evening.  I finished it off by running over a few  urlLink .50/1 tables , giving most of it back before I quit with a tidy profit for about 90 minutes of work.   Saturday:   Started off with a nice early morning round of golf with my dad.  This was my belated âFatherâs Dayâ gift and it was a nice one.  I hadnât picked up my clubs since last September, and early on, it clearly showed.  Itâs not usually a good sign when you lose 2 balls in your first 2 shots of the round, but I recovered nicely.  I normally shoot in the low 100s (stop laughing), and shot 100 once, never broken it. So, my 115 on Saturday, while not something I happily admit to all the time, was enjoyable for me. I canât wait to get back out again.  In the afternoon, my brother and his wife decided to have a luau at their place.  There was free food, free booze and cards. The only thing missing was a full roasted pig in a pit in the backyard. Iâm trying to get him to do that for next year.  But oh the free booze! Iâm fairly certain that I would have made  urlLink Al  proud with my performance. I drank the gin like it was going out of style and am fairly certain that there are no more limes or tonic water within a 5 mile radius of my brotherâs house.  The exact events of the evening are a bit hazy and staggered.  I do remember sitting at a card table at one point, but I couldnât tell you what we were playing or if I won. Luckily, my sister-in-law was nice enough to switch me to water just before I passed out, so I woke up the next morning fresh as a daisy. And it was a very good thing.   Sunday:  My wife, who graciously took my son home Saturday night and allowed me to continue my rare bender, also arranged on Sunday to take me to the  urlLink Phillies  game at the new Citizenâs Bank Park.  I had never been, and heard nothing but good things about it.  The place definitely lives up to the hype.  Of course, the only thing I have to compare it to is the Vet and Giants Stadium, so the bar isnât all that high. But the place really is sweet.  We got there a little early, got our food from Tony Lukeâs and settled into our 3rd baseline seats.  We sat in the first level (section 134), under the overhang, so we didnât roast in the brutal sun all day long and watched a pretty good game.  My wife got a nice eyeful when Pat Burrell slid into 3rd and ripped his pants.  He was standing there at 3rd, not 100 feet from us, ass hanging out and nearly every woman with her binoculars plastered to their eyes.  And you ladies call us pigs.  So, all in all, the weekend gets a solid 9.5 out of 10.  If I were more sober and there had been more poker time for me, the weekend would have gotten a full 10.     A quick word to my readers...   Thanks for stopping by and reading!  Thereâs a part of me that writes this for myself, and another part that just generally enjoys writing and having other people respond to it. So, to all my readers, thanks again. You make it all worthwhile. Coming up in my next postâ¦my theory about table selection for the low limits.  Stay tuned.

       Weâve all had those days. The days we wish we could bottle up and horde in our fallout shelters when the shit hits the fan.  The days that make you come back for more because everything just goes right for you.  Even when you screw up, it just goes right.  And while, considering what Iâm playing and how Iâm playing at the tables overall, this might just be a bit of hyperbole, yesterday was one of those days for me.  It was a relatively short session, only about a hour.  But from the moment I sat down at the table, I just  knew  that I owned every other player there. My good cards held up, and the other players were so bad that my mediocre cards held up. Even my crappy cards that didnât really improve were enough to grab the blinds at times. People respected my moves.  It was a good feeling. Like when you hit a good golf shot.  You donât get the idea that youâre Tiger Woods (or Howard Lederer), but it is just enough to keep you coming back and to continue playing. It makes all the shitty suckouts and bad beats fade from your mind for long enough for you to remember why you started playing in the first place.  You know that not every day will be like this one, so you enjoy it while you can.  You commit it to memory for those days you have to look up to see the way out.  Now that Iâm done romanticizing a single good short session I had, I return to the real world.  Coming back to reality, however, I realize that Iâm still a losing player since I started back up (which admittedly, isnât that long. I have only about 500 hands in Poker Tracker, and am down 5BB, which at .50/1, is nothing). However, considering also that I won 20BB in just under a hour last night, things are looking up. I remembered that I do know how to play.  I remembered how to fold questionable hands and to punish the people that choose to play substandard cards.  And now, I think itâs time to continue learning.  Iâm going to start picking up the books again, rereading the âclassicsâ, which for low-limit are Jones, Carson, et al.  A final reminder for all those football geeks out there, there are 22 days until the start of training camp.  As we get a little closer, Iâll post a longer write-up about each conference and how I think the year will shake out.  But if youâll excuse me, I have to go revel in last nightâs goodness for just a little longer. At least until I sit down again, when I have to force myself to forget all about it and start over again.

       Oh, how Iâve missed .50/1 players. Theyâre just super wonderful. And knowledgeable! Okay, enough complaining.  This is not going to degenerate into yet another âEmpire Poker fishies stole my moneyâ crying post.  I played a bit over the weekend, much to my benefit, at first, and then yesterday, much to my detriment.  I forgot what itâs like to have people cold call 3 bets with T7s and river a straight to beat your AK that flopped top pair, and open ended straight draw.  The main problem, of course, is myself.  Iâm not playing well. In fact, Iâm playing like someone that just started playing, which of course, I have.  Iâm considering my first attempt at online poker (Dec 2003 â March 2004) as a âfirst lessonâ.  The bad part is, by the end of that, in late March, I finally started feeling comfortable playing the ring games. I started to get a better understanding of pot odds, when to lay down crappy hands, and most importantly, not to chase without the right odds (or chase hands that arenât the nuts).  Iâve won a few nice pots by making decent plays, but Iâve lost many more pots by calling with second pair or other similarly horrid calls.  As a result, my bankroll has reflected my stupidity in kind.  My only saving grace has been playing the 5+1 (yes, high juice, I know) SNGs.  They have kept my bankroll in somewhat playable condition.  I have played in 3 so far finishing 4th, 1st and 3rd.  They give me an excuse to fold using the âplay super tight early, make moves laterâ method that works well with this type of player.  I need to practice releasing questionable hands, and I think that will translate both into relative success in the SNGs and mentally preparing me to rejoin the ring games when my bankroll can handle it.  So, for the time being, Iâm sticking primarily at the SNGs. Weâll see how well that goes.   Shameless Shilling! Now in Post Form!   Okay, I've put up my shameless shilling area over on the right, mainly to pimp myself and hopefully get someone to use my bonus code to sign up on Empire if you don't play there already.  Like nearly every other poker blogger out there, I have my own bonus code (ANI77), and really, you wouldn't hurt my feelings if you decided to use it. If you doubt that, please try it out and see. You get free money. I get free money. Everyone wins!  Along similar lines, if you don't have an affiliate at Empire, and you would like one,  urlLink email  me (minus the NOSPAM) and let me know. I'll hook you up.   Passing of a Pundit   As has been reported widely (mostly on RGP), Andy Glazer, the Poker Pundit, has passed away.  While I was not overly familiar with his body of work, I did enjoy reading his work on this year's WSOP and understand that he was (and is) widely respected in the poker community.  Everyone is saddened by the loss, and poker has lost a great ambassador. For a more eloquent writeup, head over to  urlLink Iggy's  place.

       Well, the aforementioned return from exile has occurred.  Last night, for the first time in over 3 months, I sat down, fired up  urlLink Empire , and played some poker.  And it felt damn good.  As to be expected, however, I was rusty rusty rusty. I need a tetanus shot just to get over how rusty I was.  It seems that not actually practicing things makes you play like a moron.  I saw too many flops, chased way too much and just generally played poorly.  I finished the evening down 11BB at .50/1.  So I suppose the learning process begins all over again.  Iâm really looking forward to it!  I think, like so many other people that have poker blogs do, I will start tracking my bankroll.  But I think Iâm going to do it slightly differently.  Instead of tracking actual dollars, I think Iâm going to track what level Iâm currently playing at, the amount of money Iâm up (or down) from the baseline, and how many big bets that is.  Iâm going to mess around with it so it shows me what I need to see.  Iâm going to try not focusing on exactly how much money Iâm winning, but rather using the money as a âscorecardâ as Iâve heard it referred to before.  Weâll see how that goesâ¦  Iâm also going to be adding other âfeaturesâ to the site here, in an attempt to keep myself interested and actually doing things here, instead of letting it languish and fall off into obscurity, like so many  urlLink other   urlLink blogs  have done. [Editor's Note: By linking those two blogs, I'm not saying they have languished. Rather, that they write about things other than just poker. Just so there's no confusion.]   So, in another blatant ripoff from a few other blogs, and also due to the fact that I like making lists as much as the next guy, Iâm going to post a random âList of 5â on the side each week.  If you have interesting ideas for the list, leave a comment and Iâll try to add them into the rotation.  This weeks will be the Five Most Interesting People to have to Dinner.  Quite an eclectic group, but I think it would be one hell of a time.  Finally, while Iâm on the topic of lists, I came across something that makes me realize that not everyone is qualified to make lists, nor should they.  MTV2 and VH1 have become the Channel of Endless Lists lately, as you can tune into either one at nearly any time of the day and see another inane âcountdownâ show.	A few weeks ago, I caught the â urlLink 22 greatest MCs â on MTV2.  My god, these people need a clue. Chuck D at 22. Lil Kim at 8.  Any person with half a clue that thinks this is correct needs a kick in the throat. Sigh.  Well, snooping around the internet, looks like  urlLink someone already beat me to ripping these people .  Iâll leave the rest to this guy, who does it much better than I ever could. So please, if youâre making a list, please be careful.  Or at least have some justification as to why you rank things the way you do.

       Yes yes I know, I havenât posted here in almost two weeks.  I am not being lazy, I swear. Life, however, has been particularly busy lately with my brotherâs wedding, etc. So I have not been around that much.  Also, I have not been playing poker at all, and I donât feel like I had anything interesting to add, so I just didnât post.  I have been thinking, however, about expanding the list of topics I post about here, much  urlLink like   urlLink other   urlLink people  have been doing, and whose blogs I sincerely enjoy.  I have several non-poker topics that are floating around in my head, I just need an excuse to sit down and actually get them on paper.  Maybe Iâll start doing that and throwing in other poker stuff as it comes up. (Incidentally, I hope it will be coming up soonâ¦my exile from the poker world I think will be coming to an end in the near future. Stay tuned).  Anyway, on to todayâs topic posting: The venerable drunk poker blogger Al Canât Hang has posited the following on me:    2. Sean - How are the Phillies going to end up come the fall?   Now I am not normally a baseball fan (itâs #3 on my list of enjoyable sports to watch, #472 on my list of things I can do with relative competence) as football is more my area of interest, but Iâll take a stab at this.  The most important thing to remember here is what town weâre talking about: Philadelphia.  The Most Cursed Sports Town in History (all of you screaming about Boston and Chicago may go look at the Patriots and Bulls, respectively, and stfu).  Okay, a little more seriously, all of the âcurseâ nonsense aside, the Phillies have undergone massive destruction to their starting pitching for the first half of the year and are still in contention for both the division and the wild card.  The new ballpark plays smaller than Coors field, even though thereâs not much difference in the dimensions between Citizenâs Bank and the Old Concrete Toilet. Thome is a monster. Burrell started off hot, has cooled a little, but is still playing OK.  Abreu is underrated and really a decent power hitter.  Rollins is starting to come around and not be such a moron in the leadoff spot.  Byrd is a bit of a bust (or maybe just having a sophomore slump), but the real problem is the pitching.  Padilla and Wolf need to get healthy and in a hurry if they want to have any shot at the playoffs. And the staff âaceâ (I use that term loosely) Millwood needs to seriously step up.  Milton has won 10 games, but his ERA is close to 5.00.  Their hitting has been enough to keep them in the running while their pitching looks more JV than the Dallas Offense ( urlLink had to get that shot in ), but in order for them to have any shot, the pitching needs to come around.  I think that the Phillies will win the division, probably by no more than 2 games over Florida, and will probably face Houston in the NLDS and lose there.  Unless they make a move before the deadline (which I doubt. Ed Wade has shown in the past that he sticks with the team he has). Close, but no cigar this year for the Phils.   Watch out Hank. Iâm a-cominâ.   I just found out from my work that, due to retirement in our company, I may be sent to our Anaheim plant for a week to 10 days to help them and give âtechnical supportâ â basically dealing with customers all day long and maybe doing some design.  So, stuck out on the West Coast for 10 days and nothing to do but work? Hmmmmâ¦Iâm sure thereâs a thing or two I can find to do, right  urlLink Hank ?

       Apparently, Iâm back to my old form, which is playing impatiently, winning a lot of money one night only to dump it down the drain the next by not being able to release those second-best hands that continue to plague me.  Overall, I was up for the weekend, but I ran into some bad playing and just some variance on Saturday night that brought my winnings into the more modest range.  I am finally in the green for the month, which is good, but I canât help but feel that my game continues to be consistently inconsistent.  Friday night, I wanted to repair the damage Iâd done during the week by sitting down to a nice long 2 hour session.  I wrote earlier about not feeling like I had enough time to fold through the bad hands before improving, and having the time to be disciplined if I donât get good cards early on in the session.  I was really able to do this on Friday and felt good doing it.  I finished the night around +80, and finally had my bankroll above $300, which certainly felt very good.  Nothing particularly interesting about how I did win, except one hand where I took advantage of someone being on tilt and defending their blind when I had QQ on the button.  Flop came 9 high and I made a pot sized bet (~$5) when they raised me back $10.  I immediately went all-in over the top of them for the rest of their stack (another $11 or so) and they called.  The 9 paired on the turn and my stomach sank.  But thankfully they showed 85o or something for second pair and I took down the $65 pot.  Saturday night was like Friday, just in reverse.  I sat down early and actually got recognized at the table by my blog.  This is only the second time this has happened to me, and it was very exciting.  So, thank you to  gr8engr , who said hello to me at the tables.  However, my excitement at being recognized quickly turned to semi-embarrassment as I went all-in with trips (one in my hand and 2 on the board) and both times lost to the other guy holding the case card and a better kicker than me.  Down $50 in about 20 minutes, I quickly recognized that it was not my night, and I was not mentally correct to continue playing, so I went to bed early.  I feel like this was probably the best move of my weekend.  Sunday, I just felt like I was stuck in neutral.  A lot of crappy folding hands, but I hung around for about a hour or so and won maybe 2 hands.  The one hand I did win, however, was enough for me to end my night +$6, so I might as well have played a SNG for my time and accomplished the same thing.  But again, I think I worked on improving my discipline, which is quickly showing itself as my biggest flaw.  Itâs been said many times here and other places that the $25NL games can be quite a grind if you are not catching decent cards, and the âfold and wait for the nutsâ mentality is difficult because, well, itâs not very entertaining.  It has been, for me, the most profitable, however, and I think it can only be good if (when) I decide to move to the $50 or $100 NL tables.  Iâll need more arrows in my quiver at those levels, but the fundamental tenet of folding second-best hands or worse is something that needed to be cemented in my mind before I even think about moving up.    If I were Commissioner of the Worldâ¦    [Please note that this title and writing style is a blatant ripoff of Bill Conlin, a Philadelphia sportswriter. If he is reading this, my profound apologiesâ¦]   If I were Commissioner of the (Poker) World, hand histories would be profoundly easier to get, and you wouldnât be screwed if you remembered at hand 105 that you need to get your histories.  Letâs break this down pretty easily. An average 100 hand history email is somewhere in the neighborhood of ~400KB. Letâs also say that Party/Empire has dealt somewhere in the neighborhood of 800,000,000 hands.  If they were to keep a record of every single hand, that is 3200 GB of information (actually a little less since 1 MB = 1024 KB, not 1000, etc).  This is 13 250GB hard drives, which, for a multimillion dollar company, is a fraction of a fraction of the rake they make on a daily basis.  Thereâs no way I should be restricted from searching through there to get my hand histories.  Iâll wait a few hours if the search I want to do is particularly old or large.  But, I think itâs a hell of a lot easier to ask Party to send me all the hands I played on a daily basis rather than having to remember to request it every 100 hands and face the potential of missing out on a few hands here and there.  Thatâs all.  I log in on Tuesday and say âSend me all the hands I played on Mondayâ or âAll the hands I played last Wednesdayâ and it will be done.  Itâs no harder than searching for the last 100 hands played by me.  Maybe Iâm just being too analâ¦

       It felt good to remember what a winning session looks like.  Last night I sat down for just over an hour to grind out a paltry $10 at the $25NL tables.  Not a tremendous amount, but the numbers look green in  urlLink Poker Tracker , and thatâs just fine with me.  However, I am still in search for my missing flops.  If anyone has seen them, Iâd appreciate it if you can return them to me. Iâm going on Day 3 of missing nearly every flop I see.  My biggest wins last night came in the blinds when I actually did get a small piece of the flop and managed to steal the pots.  I canât remember the last time I had a decent starting hand and have a flop to match it.  I definitely canât remember the last time I flopped a set when I held a pocket pair.  It just hasnât happened.  I have laid down (correctly) hands that have flopped monsters (KQo laid down to a $4 preflop raise and reraiseâ¦flop came AJT; 5T in the SB laid down to a $2 preflop raiseâ¦flop came 555).   And I know not to get results-oriented, but itâs discouraging to see these monsters that you laid down, meanwhile the hands you do stay in never seem to fully materialize.  All that being said, however, I did finish the night slightly north of even, so how bad could it have been?  The bottom line of all of this is: I love these tables.  The $25NL tables on  urlLink Empire  are, if you can play with the correct discipline, full of people just willing to hand over their money to you.  As an aside, if youâre looking for some very sound advice on how to play these tables, head on over to  urlLink HDubâs place .  He is the one who turned me onto these tables when we played live at HP last month, and I havenât looked back since. I have to really agree with everything he says in his post.  Itâs not exactly the most exciting game here, and youâre not going to get to use your Fancy Plays to take down huge pots all the time.  It might work once in a session, but only after youâve gotten cards to build a solid image.  Beating this game is like beating the .50/1 game or the 1/2.  You need the cards, because youâre gonna get called.  But, your patience will be rewarded.  Quite handsomely, I might add.   A home tourney you say?   I recently introduced my brother and his friends to playing poker, teaching them slowly a little at a time.  Weâve not gotten to the point where weâre playing for money, yet, because I still feel a little guilty about taking such obvious fish money this early on, but theyâre starting to come around.  While at his house a few weeks ago for a party, he and his friends said they want to run a small tournament at his house around Labor Day.  My brother tells me that he can get 20 people to come and they were thinking of about $20 buyin.  Now, I am still the only one in this whole bunch who has any real poker experience, so I offered to help him organize it from a logistics perspective (starting chips, blind structure, house rules).  I am sure that this will be a daunting task, so anyone that has done this in the past and has words of wisdom to impart, Iâm all ears!

       This is a topic that has been tackled numerous times on almost every blog that I read, but not one that Iâve really looked at myself.  And now is as good a time as ever, so here it goesâ¦  Even though I am a scientist by trade, I have always enjoyed reading and writing.  The fact that I havenât always done particularly well at it never deterred me from writing for myself.  I have written several short stories that nobody has ever read, nor will they ever read.  I wrote for myself, and that seemed to be enough.  But then I started to get more into watching and playing poker, and I wanted a place to write my thoughts down, and to start sharing them with other people in an attempt to improve myself.  I had managed to avoid the whole âblog phenomenonâ through the explosion in the early 2000-2001 time when blogs really started to become prevalent.  I just didnât get them.  In December 2003, I really started to get serious about being a poker player, and starting reading anything I could get my hands on.  For those of you that have poked around on the web to see what there is about poker (and really, if youâre here reading this, you probably are well aware and have done this several times), there really isnât too much thatâs current, unless you want to wade into RGP or 2+2.  For a newbie like myself, that was good to read, but very intimidating to try joining into and posting.  I just wasnât going to do that.  On a lark one day, I just did a search for âpoker blogâ in Google to see if there was anyone else like me that had decided to write about poker in a semi-public forum, about their own experiences.  And, lo and behold, I found this âcommunityâ of people that all had the same idea as me, and presumably, all around the same time.  There must have been something in the collective unconscious that called people to all start the same type of blog at the same time.  Immediately, I decided then that I would do the same.  I would write about my own trials and tribulations about poker, in the attempt that someone else would be able to read it and relate to it, and share their own experience.  I would read other people to see myself in their play, and to see what they are going through.  I rarely proofread anything that I writeâ¦I just sit down, type and go. It just seems more ârealâ to me that way and, quite frankly, Iâm too lazy to go and correct myself.  I donât want to get into over-editing my own thought process, because I donât know how beneficial that will be for me in the long run.  I donât pretend that I offer any great poker insights, or that anyone stopping here to read this will immediately become overwhelmed with my poker wisdom.  I think that, overall, thereâs nothing that I can write that hasnât been said, dissected, analyzed, diagrammed and discussed by people much smarter about poker than me, and in a much more elegant manner.  I donât pretend to be a high-stakes pro, and really donât have much of a desire to ever become one.  I write about what I see every day at the tables (virtual or no), and to people who have experience with poker, most of it seems very trivial or mundane.  I do it in the hope that I will be able to recognize the small glimmers in the haystack of the mundane that I will be able to pick up, polish off, learn from and ultimately improve myself.  That goes both for the writing and the poker.  Hopefully, this will occur.  Weâll see.

       Todayâs post promises to be chock full of rambling, non sequiturs and incoherent babbling. There may be an occasional nugget of wisdom, but it will need some polishing. You see, Iâve wanted to write a lot lately. Iâve been bitten by the writing bug. However, Iâve also been kicked in the head with the writerâs block. I want to write  something , but every time I try to sit and formulate some thoughts about  anything , I end up with  nothing . But just like the best way to get out of a slump in baseball is to hit your way out of it, Iâm going to attempt to write my way out of this lull in the creative process. Hopefully it will work. If it doesnât, then thereâll be another post tomorrow.   On the poker frontâ¦   Iâve caught a serious case of Second-Best-Handitis. It hasnât been fatal, yet, Iâve been breaking somewhat even, if down slightly. Itâs frustrating to have the nuts only to have them turn into crap on the river. Some of this has been my fault at the NL tables, not playing my hands properly. Keeping people around, and inviting them to call when you have the nuts can be profitable, if the hands hold up. But if they have second best hand that becomes a monster on the river, youâre really sunk. I donât know if this is a flaw in my game that Iâll have to evaluate, but it will give me something to think about.  However, I will talk about how much I love the NL tables at  urlLink Empire . Iâve only stuck to the $25 buyin tables, which I suppose is analogous to playing .50/1 limitâ¦the worst players are here, which makes for great games, but also soul-crushing suckouts. Itâs something you just have to live with and adjust your game accordingly, which is something Iâm currently struggling with. I have no doubt, however, that Iâll be able to pull it around and get back to my winning ways soon enough. I think my biggest obstacle to fixing this problem, thus far, has been the lack of time I have had to address it. It is tough enough to squeeze out a hour session these days for me, and anything longer than that is damn near impossible. And while âhit and runâ sessions are sometimes very good and very profitable for me, there are times like this when youâre struggling to break even when you just need a nice 6 hour session and grind out a modest win to feel better about yourself. For me, thatâs just not gonna happen any time soon.   On the reading frontâ¦   Iâm almost done with  Poker Nation , which is a very quick and very entertaining read. I highly recommend it if youâre just looking for a book with interesting poker anecdotes about the âpoker undergroundâ in NYC and the saga of Andy Bellin. The stories arenât as high profile as  Positively Fifth Street , but this book is more coherent. No random chapters about Sylvia Plath to distract you from the fact that this is a poker story book. If you havenât read it, pick it up.   On the pet frontâ¦   I want to send my condolences here to  urlLink Iggy , who just lost his family friend Monty the Cat. This weekend, the day after I got home from California, my wife and I had to put down our dog, DeeDee, after an extended illness. Her kidneys just shut down and there wasnât anything to do to help her, except to end her misery. She was the first thing my wife and I got when we moved into our house after our marriage, and she was our âfirst childâ. Half lab, half pit bull, an all-around kickass dog.      On the sports frontâ¦   The Phillies have won 2 games in a row? Larry Bowa is sure to get an extension nowâ¦still will finish 10 games out. Have faith. Have faith.  Someone please check out what Merril Hodge is drinking? He has gone on record, several times, with saying that the Redskins will win the NFC East because of Joe Gibbs (a coach whoâs been out of the league 12 years) and Clinton Portis (a good back in a very good system in Denver). Thatâs fine, heâs entitled to his opinion. However, he also claims that the Eagles will not make the playoffs because they donât have Duce Staley and they have young cornerbacks. Clearly, this is a man on crack and should be sitting with Quincy Carter somewhere.  And, not to take potshots and the Cowboys, because itâs so easy these days, but they have now become the first team in NFL history whose coach has more athleticism and is probably younger than their starting QB.  *insert rimshot here*   To  urlLink BG , thank you for taking Derrick Coleman from us. May you enjoy his talents as much as we did in Philadelphia.  Thatâs about all I got for now...thanks again for stopping by to read this blog! And if you made it this far, you deserve a  urlLink drink .

        Due to the fact that I have only played about 1 hour of poker since my return to the East Coast, and that was pretty uneventful (read as: bad play returning to my game), Iâm just going to post a random list of thoughts that are floating around in my head, and I donât feel like fully developing. Perhaps Iâll leave them here as a list of ideas for later postsâ¦    In the airport on the way home last week, I was looking for  something interesting to read on the flight home.  I wandered into the LAX bookstore and searched around for the games section, hoping there would be a poker book to pick up and study.  I find the half of a shelf they have devoted to poker, and what do I find? 10 copies of Hellmuthâs book.  I look around for someone to beat severely about the head and shoulders and start to move away, when I see another book hidden behind the Hellmuth Bonanza. Itâs Poker Nation, by Andy Bellin.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but I picked it up and what Iâve read of it so far (about halfway through) has been very good.  Not a strategy book, but a fun read. If you havenât read it, pick it up.  About a month ago, Al asked me where I thought the Phillies would finish the year up, and I made some boneheaded prediction about the wildcard or winning the division.  Apparently, I forgot to factor in the utter stupidity of the Common Philadelphia Sports Team GM.  This is a trait that all 4 teamsâ GMs possess, but it is most pronounced in the Phililes, who shell out $93 million for a roster with holes, and then will not spend another $5 million to fill the holes and insure a winner.  And they refuse to give up their golden pitching prospects, who, with any luck, will become the next Brandon Duckworth or Brett Myers (reread if sarcasm not detected). So Al, I now amend my answer to âTheyâll finish 10 games out of first. And Larry Bowa will get a contract extension.â  Someone, please make TV good again.  I was kicking around an idea of the Top Five Shows You Should Be Watching But Probably Arenât, and only got to number 3 before realizing that there really isnât anything good on TV.  And what used to be good has been hyped to the point that it now sucks.  Except for âAmerican Chopperâ.  That show is still amusing to watch.  I hate to bring up (yet again) my hatred for ESPN, but I did give them credit for their production of last yearâs WSOP and hoped they didnât completely fuck up this yearâs.  Well, they have. 10 handed final tables in 1 hour? A little rushed, but they squeeze it even more by adding crap like Chris Ferguson cutting a pickle by chucking a card at it.  Stud events? Great, I was looking forward to seeing them, until I realized they were morons and would not show you the up-card so you really donât know how good those hole cards are until Norman Chad shuts up long enough for you to find out.  The next Poker Blogger Tournament has been announced, with no set date yet.  However, I am offering a bounty on my head (which should not be hard to collect). I will send you, free of charge, my copy of Play Poker Like the Pros, by Phil Hellmuth, Jr.  A collectorâs item, indeed.  Iâll even autograph it for you, if you wish.  And if this makes you intentionally avoid me to prevent yourself from knocking me out, then it has done itâs job.
