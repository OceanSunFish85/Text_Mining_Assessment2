      If you have been looking at my site then I thank you. I need to get a counter to see if my work is read or just skimmed over and forgotten. Please if you read on my site just leave a little comment even if it is is as simple as "I read your work and I (like/dislike) it." That is allI ask. I would like to maybe start a flame war if anyone is willing to go down like a man. Don't take it personally if you lose I know I won't. Well that is all i have to say until i get a counter for my website.   Thanx alot  not your accident

      home now,  away from the war  away from the violence,  away from the gore   back to your home town,  out of Hell  there is a church  ringing its bell   people all around,  asking what it was like  they couldn't under stand  any of this fight   they sit at home  watching their set  while others fighting for freedom  get shot in the chest   i walk to my home now,  a boy tugs at my shirt  then he asks me,  "did you ever get hurt   i said it's hard to understand  the pain that i feel  i bend over,  then come to a kneel   i ask for his name,  he says, "Jonny White"  then it hits me,  his dad died in this fight   we fought together,  across the sea  i know that bullet  was intended for me   i say to the boy  "your father was a good man"  then we walk away,  hand in hand

      Here I am at my bedside  Having visions, of suicide  I am sick of this contemplation  All my thoughts just lead to frustration    All the hate is getting bigger  I know now that I will pull the trigger  With this death no one will suffer  This epidemic is getting tougher    I have been accused of rape  This is the only way I can escape  This is the ultimate price to pay  But Iâm glad not to see another day    It wasnât even and accident  Because I am innocent  They think they are after the right guy  And for that I have to die

      The pain is getting stronger  Darkness now oâre my eyes  They do not see my struggle  They do not hear my cries    I have lost all control and  I have a new addiction  I donât know if I can take it  With all this self infliction    I feel the hatred raising  Iâm getting madder now  You think you know what its like  Blood dripping from your brow    It hurts so very badly  Oh shit I cut too deep  I am here all alone and  Lifeâs hill is getting steep    There are no people by me  No lights flashing around  Iâm going to die lonely  I think as I hit the ground
