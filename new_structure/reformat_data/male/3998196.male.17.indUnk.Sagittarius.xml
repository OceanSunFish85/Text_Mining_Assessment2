      Today SAM 29000 visited Cleveland bringing President Bush in from Grand Rapids. Greg and I got to the airport just in time to check it out and I managed to get quite a few pictures of the beautiful bird. After the presidential motor cade passed by and the roads re-opened, we went down to Northrop but ended up back behind the FedEx ramp by coincidence. We were following the new Independance Air truck driving around and ended up with about 40 other people lined up along the fence there. 29000 was parked just about 30 yards beyond the fence, stairs down, Air Force guys hanging around her. The storm clouds were gathering so I snapped a few pictures and off we went. Below I've included a small version of a picture I took today. Just after I took it the rain started to fall. I got lucky.  After seeing Air Force 1 Super Team Discovery went into action. The Tire Rescue Team, or TRT, chalked up another save. A Michellin Radial was saved from the weeds just before the heaviest rain of the month hit. God bless you, TRT!  Time for bed now. I gotta get up early so I'm able to sleep tomorrow night! Only a day till the Dulles trip! WOOT!

      Today...was...sweet. It was time again for the annual trip to a Pirates game. My dad, Greg, Kait, and I all headed down to Pittsburgh for a day of airplanes, baseball, and food. We first stopped at Pittsburgh Int'l to watch some runway 32 arrivals. There is a  really  cool cemetary right under the approach path and just off the end of 32. Only problem was we were therenot 5 minutes before a Moon Twshp. Police car showed up. He ran our plates and told us we had to leave. Fortunatly, he wasn't a bastard and he said we could go up the street a bit and I could take all the pictures I wanted there. The spot was in a driving range parking lot. It wasn't near as good as the cemetary, but I got some cool side-angle shots and it wasn't bad. At least we could stay around. After a short while we drove down through Moon past where my dad used to live. We also saw the US Airways Flight Training Center where all the sims are. I'm thinking I'm gunna ask for a tour of that facility some time.  At about 330 we got downtown...errr..."dahntahn." We were all hungry so, naturally, we went up the incline to the Grandview Restaurant. It's a really cool place with an awesome view of the city. The burgers are pretty good too! After being thoroughly stuffed, it was time to head down the incline to the boat dock. Just beyond the bottom of the Duquesne Incline is a large railroad track. I made several ozog related gestures but...much to my surprise... a car rolled past that I  swear Ozog spray painted on. It said "FAG POWER" in large letters with 2 male symbols interlocking. Maybe our good friend Bob has seen this car at some time? We may never know, but it made for a good laugh.  As soon as we reached the stadium (after a delightful sail aboard the Good Ship Lollipop) we went straight for the souveneir booth. I was really hoping for some bobblehead pierogies and I was not disappointed. Although they didn't have a Potato Pete, I did come away with a bobblehead Saurkraut Saul and MAN does he DANCE! The game started out great but it just leveled off after the 1st inning. Nobody scored, everyone was getting out... kinda boring if all you were doing was watching baseball. Lucky for Greg and I we had peanuts, pierogies, and plenty of hey-babies to pass the time. We even gota KC-135 and B-17 flyover! But then, in the 6th inning, the Great Pittsburgh Pierogie Race broke out. Pete was back!! He was enourmous and on top a large building, gripping Jalapenjo Hannah in his large white mit of a hand. That little bitch Onion Oliver had a rocket pack, though, and got Hannah free and caused Pete to fall, crushing 2 chinese pierogies. They ended the race with Cheese Chester crossing the line first.   The game ended with 3 up 3 down and a 1-0 loss for the Pirates. I was disappointed but far from having a bad day. I always love trips to Pittsburgh, especially with friends. Everyone had a great time, the city was beautiful as usual, and I got my bobblehead 'rogie.We closed out the visitwith a Good Ship Lollipop boatride past Point State Parkwith itsbeautifully lit fountain and, of course, a car ride home acting like D-bags. Gotta love the 'burgh! I think next time I go back, though,I'm going to try the cemetary again. It's an awesome spot and... of course... I gotta fight the power! The man can't hold us down!

      It was a normal day in the beginning. I woke up at the crack of 2:15, had myself a toaster strudel, and moped for a bit. Around 3 I went to pick up Greg so we could go to the bank, get some Shake Shoppe, and go rock launching. The sum total of my rolled nickles and dimes was cashed, after some skeptisism by the teller, and I walked away with 7 fresh new twenties. Keep in mind I'm in agood mood at this point, the day is going well. We proceeded to Shake Shoppe where I got my usual raspberry slush. On the way through Strongsville I was quite content- slushy in hand, engine muttering about the slow speeds and traffic, me talking about strafing North Park with napalm... then... it happened. God must have had it in for me today because my car ended up stopped right next to a white, rusty, POS Oldsmobile 88. Who was in this car? Well, I won't get into names, but let's just say I stared evil in the face. This "girl," you see, is not only terribly unattractive but she also has an attitude to boot (and several venereal diseases, I'm sure). Imagine the movie Raiders of the Lost Arc. Think of the scene where the Nazis open the Arc of the Covenant and all the spirits are let loose. This girls face... it looks very similar to the faces of the melting Nazis in the afformentioned Indiana Jones movie. I was horrified! I was staring evil right in the eye... I was looking at a walking case of Gonorreah gone terribly, terribly wrong. I had to avert my eyes and, thanks be to God, traffic moved again. If only I had had my airhorn, though. I could have warded off the evil (and her STD ridden passengers) with a blast of righteous airy goodness. Oh well, It could have been worse. At least I could avert my gaze and not have to stare deep into the unknowns of the Arc of the Covenant.

      Alright, I made this thing so I could vent, so I'm gunna vent. Listen up, fuckers. How fast  I  go down the street  I  am driving on is  completely  up to  me.  There is absolutly nothing you can do about it. Go figure I always choose to do the speed limit! So why the heck is it that ass chongler vigilantes always decide to tell me to slow down? I was going down sidestreets taking greg to work today. What was my speed? 27. What is the limit? 25, but 30 is still legal. There is a line of cars and a moving van with a few people around it. So, some fucker holding his dog starts walking out in front of me. Yep! Just waltzing right into the goddamn road. What is he doing? Is he in trouble? Does he need something? No, he just wants to be a fagboner. "SLOW DOWN!" he yells as he's doing the "slide! slide!" motions with his hands. I looked at my speedometer-  27 . Last I checked that was within the confines of the law. Yet this fuckface decides that his mental speedometer is better than the one on my car! What the fuck does this guy have? Radar in his dog? Listen fuckers, unless you're a cop in a cop car with police radar-   YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME HOW FAST TO GO.   Get it?? What the fuck is wrong with you?!! You  honestly  think I'm gunna say "yes sir" and slow down??   GO FONDLE A TREE STUMP YOU JACKASS!   Mind you I sped up, took the corner with tires screeching, and went 45 the rest of the way. If that ass wouldn't have said anything I'd still be doing 27, but no...he had to open his big fat boner-filled mouth.  Lick my balls, vigilante scum!!

      Today went by quick. Could it be because I woke up at 330PM? Nahhhhhh. I really did wake up at noon, but I felt like crap. Sore throat, stomach ache, and whatnot... yeah so I went back to bed. Getting ready for the day at 4 in the afternoon wasn't that bad though. Greg needed a ride to driving class so after adelicious breakfast/dinner combo we were off to Medina. Stupid driving school-- they don't actually have a building of their own so they rent space at schools, strip malls, whatever. We were supposed to be at 100 Highland Rd. at 6:15. Well, I was there at 100 Highland at 6:15... but there were 30 friggen doors to choose from. Greg wandered around for like 10 minutes trying to find the right door. Like a friggen gameshow or something.  All went well, though. Greg found his class and I went down to the apartment. Unfortunatly for me, I left Bob Ozog's application for work at Wendy's lying out on my desk. After a brief but hard-fought struggle, she ended up reading it. Mind you we listed one of Bob's past employers as Anus C. McCheese of Boners 'n More Incorporated. Why did he quit Boners 'n More? He was cought smoking dong and became embarrased. The entire app. was riddled with this garbage, but my mom was okay about it. She just laughed a couple times and gave it back.  Phew.    I went to pick Greg up again at 9. On the way home there was a good deal of lightning so we decided to head to CLE to watch. The dog was scared so we made her a bed in the car and off we went. It turned out to be a good idea after all. Every westbound jet in the world was hold up on the ground waiting to get out. Just after we arrived the "guinea pig" pathfinder 737 was sent to pick through the storm. As soon as he found a decent way through, everyone else followed. 3 heavy Airbusses, a few 737s, a Maddog, and plenty of RJs were lined up to go. For 11PM it was quite busy! If only I had my camera- some of the lightning was amazing. On the way out of the parking garage, some douchebag in a mini-van cut me and someone from NH off. The minivan was in the farthest left of 3 left turn lanes. He cut us all off and went straight. Then he ended up turning back around anyway. Jackass. But, life went on.   Greg wantedfood and I was alittlepeckish myselfso we hit up Burger King in Strongsville. We sat at the drive up thing for a good 3 minutes before a startled- and sleepy- sounding black girl came on. "Would you like to...try....a...Val...ue............  silence.  She couldn't even finish the damn sentance! So, hesitantly (and after a staunch "no"), I continued with my order. Was she copying it down? Was I even allowed to talk? I cast all my doubts to the wind and forged on with my order. Fries, burgers, onion rings... would the sleepy (and possibly high on smack) negro get it correct? Would my worries be quelmed?  NO!  The sleepy negro got it wrong. After the correction I was told..and I quote.. "okay...you can go around then.." Professional? Yes. Stunning? Definatly. Mind you there IS more than 1 possible window to go to. And... oh yeah...  HOW MUCH DOES MY DAMN MEAL COST?!  I mean, God forbid we wake you up and make you do your job. On the long, arduous journey around the building Greg turned and said "sorry we woke you up, ma'am." I laughed and regretted not saying it to her. But, well, in the end a correct order arrived- after 5 minutes of rain pouring in my open window. But I was happy enough. I won a free apple pie off my fries, the sleepy negro was left to rest and possibly snort a line of coke, andour stomachs hunger wasquelmed.

      Well, looks like I've been dragged into this online journal log thing too. I would say I plan on writing often, but I'm a procrastinating ass and I know it... so I probably will give up. But, nonetheless, I'm gunna give it the old college try. Today was a cool day I 'spose. Heck, what day that starts with flying isn't a cool day? I awakened at the bright and early time of 11:10. And yes, for me that's bright and early. I then proceeded on to Medina (1G5) for some solo flyin' time. It's so nice to be able to just show up with your flightbag and headphones and just head out to the airplane. No instructors to wait for or to tell you what to do. It really is pleasant.   Just as I was pre-flighting the airplane my dad and Steve showed up to watch. They helped me with the fuel hoses and whatnot and pretty soon I was up and running. Despite the haze and light chop it turned out to be a nice day. Not near as choppy as I had planned on. Some guy in a Cherokee 140 decided it was too choppy to fly to Michigan....I think he's nuts... but whatever. I did the usual stuff out by Chippewa Lake and then I played "fake state trooper airplane" over I-71. I love chasing the cars and watching them all slow down to a uniform speed. After the flying and the landing Steve picked Greg up and we all went down to Skypark. The airport is nice but it wasn't what Greg had built it up to be. I found only 1 or 2 airplanes to be nicer than Medina's and the runway/taxiway configuration was a bit too cramped for my liking. Like a tiny Midway. I don't think it'd be worth the 15 or 20 bucks saved on flying costs, seeing as it's a farther drive, but for Steve I'm sure it is... and Greg just hates Medina for some reason.   Anyway, a fun time was had by all.. Borders was hit up, and so was Shake Shoppe and the airport. The new runway is almost done and I can't wait for our Indy Air flight. 9 days to go! Well, now I must be off....be...off....yes... so I leave you to your resources and, God willing, I'll live to post another day.

      Well, I just got back today from our yearly trip to visit relatives in Delaware.  My dad, grandma, and I all went and I had a whole metric ton of fun as usual. On the flight down we flew under the orbiting, swirling clouds of Hurricane Charley. It was pouring rain when we got to Baltimore and left BWI for Delaware. We one of those new Chrysler 300s. Not a bad looking car, I must admit it grew on me, but the version we had sucked. The interior was spartan and far from luxury. Also, it has no pickup...zero pickup. I could outrun this thing on foot. Alright anyway.  We got the Milford around 730 in the evening. The family decided to head down to the boardwalk to watch the now Tropical Storm Charley make landfall. Needless to say there weren't many others down there. We parked next to a white Land Cruiser and headed for the beach. It was pouring rain and the wind was a steady 30 MPH, but the surf wasn't up too high and we all headed in to a fry place for a bucket-o-french fries. Cool beans nonetheless.  The rest of the week consisted of shooting, eating, fishing, and sleeping.  The first full day we went out on the ocean with a friend of my uncle's for a day of fishing. We were pretty successful and the water 8 miles out was surprisingly smooth. I cought a small sea robin and 2 croakers, my dad cought 3 croakers, and my uncle Danny cought a few croakers and a flounder. It was a successful day overall. That night we went to a somewhat cut-rate seafood place. I got rubber crab crackers and my baked potato looked like it was a week old and a grenade went off in it, but whatever. It was funny anyway.  The next day it was time to go shooting. We were shooting .223 and .242 rifles as well as the Glock and .38 revolver. We all did about average. Around 8PM everyone went to the really good Thai restaurant we found last year on the boardwalk at Rehoboth. Well, almost everyone.  My uncle Danny is stubborn and went for pizza.  I love it, though.  I got the spicy duck and a banana daquiri...drooolll.... After dinner we were greeted by tons of cops and fire fighters who were trying to pry a white Land Cruiser (remember that one?) from the front of a Grotto's Pizza restaurant. Evidently some kid got in it and plowed into the place. Funny stuff!  Yesterday we hit up the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover AFB. It's small but really cool. There were some old planes there as well as past MAC stuff out on the ramp. While we walked around looking at the C-123s, C-141s, C-130s, and the like there were C-5s, C-17s, and E-3s doing touch-n-go's on the airbase. I've seen C-5s plenty before but to see them break onto final in a 45 degree bank half a mile off the end and then bring the lumbering, grinding beast to a smooth touchdown was really impressive. The idle thrust on the Galaxy sounds like a fire engine siren.  After that we had time to kill so we went shooting again. We shot one of the rifles that didn't work the other time and we all did alot better. My dad showed both my uncle and I up by firing 5 rounds through an area the size of a dime from 100 yards. He ruined my uncle's life, I think, because he's been trying to do it for 25 years and here comes my dad, someone who never shoots, and bam- he outguns him. The word spread like wildfire. My cousins were really ragging my uncle for it and Danny was talking about it up until we left for BWI.  We left the house at 8AM for the airport. The flight home was uneventful and pleasant but I was sad our trip was over. Delaware is the final trip of summer... a signal that it's almost time to get back to the old grind... it's kind of depressing. I like relaxing out on the east coast, but I guess I'll have to wait another year.
