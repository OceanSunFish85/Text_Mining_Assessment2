      I came across an intriuging recent article in the Washington Post (by way of  urlLink Religion News Blog ) regarding how young adult-aged children of immigrants are attempting to both respect their religion of Islam while acclimating to the culture of modern Italy.  One young man, quoted in the article, stated:   "I find that Italians accept you as an individual," said...Sabhe Ayoub, a young Palestinian refugee from Gaza, "They accept us more than we would if they migrated to our countries. The hostility after Sept. 11? Some of it is understandable. But some of it is a political game of people trying to win votes at our expense. We just want to get along."   It's interesting to read Ayoub's assertion that he and his peers find more tolerance and acceptance in the west while douting that similar young adults from the west would find the same where he came from.  Although President Bush was very clear that Moslems and individuals of Arab descent were not to be persecuted after the horrible events of September 11th, time after time I have heard and read of ongoing problems here in the U.S. Perhaps some of this is understandable given that those of us in the west have had little to no exposure to people raised and/or practicing their Islamic faith.  I've never been to Italy so I can not write from experience. However, based on conversations with my Italian-language tutor, who is a native of Italy, it seems that Italians are not quite used to having to deal with large numbers of immigrants as we have here in the States. And yet, here in this article, several young adult Moslems are quoted as stating that they find a level of tolerance and acceptance in Italy that prompts within them a desire to embrace some of its ways. I can't recall ever having read or heard the same from similar young adults who were born and raised here in the States. Is there a fundamental cultural difference between the U.S. and, for example, a culture such as Italy when it comes to an overall attitude of tolerance and acceptance (at least towards those who practice a different religious faith)?  In any event, it seems that where tolerance and acceptance abound the temptation to embrace a more extremist world view tends to diminish.

      Last night my brother Luigi and I watched part of the  urlLink Democratic Convention  (he needed some "hope" given how he's  urlLink  feeling   about the present administration). One of the first speakers was former Vice President Al Gore. To my surprise he was actually quite funny and appeared more relaxed than usual.   During his speech he made an appeal to disaffected Republicans to consider voting across party lines. He then said something that surprised me:   urlLink  I also ask tonight for the help of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000.Â  I urge you to ask yourselves this question:Â  do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?    Although he never mentions Ralph Nader or the Green Party by name, the implication is obvious. I was one of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000. I have some of the same concerns about the U.S.' two party system as I had back then, but I recently found the site  urlLink Greens for Kerry . There is an interesting quote from Medea Benjamin, whom I admire, who ran for the U.S. Senate here in California. She states:   In the swing states, where this election's going to be determined, [Greens should] recognize that we owe it to the global community to get rid of George Bush. And if people in those swing states support that strategy of getting rid of George Bush, than voting for Kerry might be the strategic vote for them."   Well, I can say one thing for President Bush and his administration: it certainly has helped, sans Nader and his campaign, unite progressives and liberals in this country in a way that I haven't seen in some time.

      Here are  urlLink queries  from Pacific Yearly Meeting and North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) regarding Meeting for Worship:   Pacific Yearly Meeting :  Q. Do I come to Meeting with heart  mind prepared for worship? Q. In both silent and vocal ministry, do I respond to leadings of the Holy Spirit, without pre-arrangement and in simplicity and truth? Q. Am I careful not to speak at undue length or beyond personal spiritual experience?   Q. Do we meet in expectant waiting for the promptings of the Divine Spirit? Q. Are we drawn together in a living silence by the power of God in our midst?   (queries in italics are for the Meeting as a community)   North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) :  1. Do we faithfully uphold our testimony for worship which is based on silent waiting, and for a free and unprogrammed ministry that may be shared by all? Is there a living silence in which we feel drawn together by the Light of Christ, the power of God in our midst; and is this inspiration carried over into our daily lives? Do we come to meeting with hearts and minds open and ready to worship in silence or in vocal ministry or prayer as the Holy Spirit leads us? Does our Meeting encourage those who may have a gift in the spoken ministry?  2. Are we faithful in our attendance at meetings for worship and are we careful not to disturb the spirit of the meeting by our late arrival? Is our behavior therein that of open submission to God in silent communion?  [NCYM's  Faith  Practice  is  urlLink online .]

      No, silly, not the  urlLink Tour de France , but my vacation back to the northeast for two weeks.   Yep, I'll be visiting my hometown of  urlLink Rochester, NY  for a week, then a long weekend in  urlLink Albany, NY  (where I lived for over nine years), and then end the "tour" with a visit on the  urlLink Cape  with a dear friend of mine.   I doubt I'll have ongoing access to a computer so the posting here should be sparse for a time.  Ciao, ciao!

      Liberal Quakerism is not alone in contemplating whether diversity undermines or enriches its sense of identity, purpose, and distinctiveness.   While doing some catching up on my blog-reading I happened upon this  urlLink post  by Philocrites regarding a recent report made by the  urlLink Commission of Appraisal  of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). In an interview with the Boston Globe, Earl Holt, minister of King's Chapel and chair of the Commission, is asked whether the UUA has gone too far with its diversity. Holt replied, in part,  "I'm ready to defend now the hypothesis that Unitarian Universalism as it presently exists is not in any meaningful way . . . a continuity of either of the traditions" from which it sprung. Embracing all theological viewpoints â "at some point, pandering would not become too strong a word" â the UUA has lost the sense of unity that underlies community, Holt argues.  Elsewhere, while skimming through the  urlLink Jewish Reconstructionist Federation  site, I came across an article entitled  urlLink âWho is a Reconstructionist Jew?â  On the side bar is the phrase:   The past has a vote, not a veto.   In addition, the question of diversity at the cost of losing a sense of the movementâs past and distinctiveness is reviewed in an article entitled  urlLink "The Evolving Face of Reconstructionism"  in the online magazine  urlLink Reconstructionism Today . Hereâs an interesting quote:  Professor Eisen noted that Kaplan  [founder of the Reconstructionist movement â my addition]  was insistent on a "maximalist Judaism," with Torah, interpreted in a contemporary light, providing a way of life. This maximalist approach remains central to Reconstructionism, particularly in our approach to Jewish "values-based decision-making," which has increasingly become a trademark of our congregations. Its paradigmatic model consists of:  â¢	Study of Jewish sources, traditions and practices.  â¢	Study of current information from the social and natural sciences.  â¢	Reflection on personal and communal values.  â¢	Analysis of the impact of each possible decision on each affected party.  â¢	Democratic and inclusive processes that maximize the number of participants along the way to a final decision.   It seems that Friends in the liberal branch of Quakerism attempt to at least try and include many of the same things mentioned in the above quote: we study Quaker sources, traditions, and practices; we attempt to be aware of information from the social and natural sciences; we reflect and seek Divine Guidance on personal and corporate values; we attempt to discern the impact of our decision making process; and we seek a  urlLink sense of the Meeting  as a way to make a decision.  And yet, do we do this? It seems that in the interest of diversity our Meetings and organizations have studied and sought Quakers sources, traditions and practices (I include the study of the Bible as well as the readings of earlier generations of Friends) less and less often. Perhaps the phrase âpast has a voice, but not a vetoâ should read âWhat past? No need to fear a veto!â for us liberal Friends. More and more new comers to Quakerism (and I refer only to the liberal branch here) have less understanding of its traditional beliefs and practices; and its children and youth are left with the impression that as long as they are kind, pacifist, and form their own religious opinions they are Quakers. This amorphousness results in many of our young people drifting away to other traditions that offer a more solid understanding of its beliefs and practices (e.g. Roman Catholicism or Buddhism) or to rejecting organized religion altogether (ironically enough given that many of their parents came to Quakerism due to their rejection of organized religion). New comers, on the other hand, mistakenly translate the fact that Quakers donât have creeds to mean that we donât have any doctrines or beliefs (other than the overly used âthat of God in everyoneâ and the even less specific âthe Lightâ). Thus, they spend their time amongst Friends discovering and creating their own belief systems (if any at all) and, if they choose to join, wind up expecting (sometime demanding) that the Religious Society of Friends shift and change to accommodate their unique, idiosyncratic belief system.  But, what to do? Where do we âdraw the lineâ? These are difficult questions since Friends have a history of being so rigid and doctrinaire that for a period of time they âdisownedâ (read: excommunicated) thousands of its members.   Have we gone too far the other way? The struggle is to find a way that it neither too unbending nor too yielding (for the sake of individualism and diversity). At a minimum Meetings and organizations need to become reengaged with Friendsâ past through ongoing Quaker 101 studies for newcomers, Bible and Faith  Practice studies, and children and youth programs that specifically teach the very same things in a way that younger folks can appreciate. (And I can just hear someone in the choir loft yell out right now, âGood luck!â)

      Here's an interesting news item that I ran across at  urlLink LesbianNation  (by way of  urlLink Queer Day News ): the Bush Administration has invited the Reverend Troy Perry (founder of the  urlLink Metropolitan Community Church , a Christiandenominationthat primarily serves the bisexual, transgendered, lesbian, and gay male communities - I justhad tomix the usual orderup to make it more interesting to read)to a    a summit to help the Bush Administration set government adoption and foster care policies. (Click  urlLink here  to see full story.)    Admittedly, at first I thought I had made a mistake while reading the headline. Surely, it actuallystated that the Bush administration had   not   invited Reverend Troy Perry (as perhaps previous administrationshad done in the past and hence the newsworthiness of the report). But, after squinting a little closer I discovered that my eyes had read the headline properly.   I tend to have a lot of strong disagreements with President George W. Bush and his administration. However, I also want to, well, give a positive nod when it isdue. I'm not sure if Reverend Perry will accept the offer, and if he does, if the experience will be all that fruitful, but I am at least happy that this offer, this olive-branch (of sorts, I guess???) has been made. Acknowledging the effort, even if some might say it is"too little, too late" is one way to encourage some of the same behaviorin the future. It's my way of trying to encourage a more peaceful interchange with others that view me as their enemy.

      I live a mere 34 miles from the  urlLink Magic Kingdom .I have never visited Disneyland (nor its sister site  urlLink Disney World ) as a child, adolescent, young adult, or ever, until now. My dearest friend Jill, her family, and her brother-n-law's family were visiting for the day, and given that I haven't seen her or her family in a year's time (they live in Rochester, NY), and given that I have never been to one of the "magic kingdoms", I decided to join them for the day.    I'm back home from spending about5 1/2 hours there.    I'm  urlLink numb .    Temperatures were at least 80 degrees under a boiling, bright southern-CA summer sun;hundreds of adults with even morechildren running around under foot;waiting in long, circuitous lines that tookfour times as long to wade through thanthe actual ride took to entertain the guests; happy, shiny "helpers"periodically checkingto make sure that "everything's OK"; faux hillbilly bandsplaying Disney-related musicwhile sitting in a faux salooneating cheeseburgers; some of the adults actingmore childish than the kids. For the love of God, what werewe thinking?    No wonder there are European countries that have resisted or rebuked the invasion of the Mouse on their valiant shores!    Actually, despite and including all of the aboveIhad a   very   nice  fun time (yes, I know,  urlLink Teresa , you were right again).It was great tovisit withJill and her family and friends. And the kids were real troopers despite the heat, the lines, and the little disappointments that can easily mare a day liketoday.    Favorite ride of the day:  urlLink Indiana Jones Adventure .Plus, I was entirely impressed withthe staffgettinghundreds of carsefficiently parked in neat little rows. I parked in  urlLink Goofy , section H, row 7.    Andall for a mere for $49.75! Trauma has never been so cheap!

      This is the title of a new guide put forth by the  urlLink National Council of Churches  (NCC) â USA. They list 10 principles by which members of their congregations can better evaluate a candidateâs stated policy objectives. These Christian principles:  1. War is contrary to the will of God. 2. God calls us to live in communities shaped by peace and cooperation. 3. God created us for each other, and thus our security depends on the well being of our global neighbors. 4. God calls us to be advocates for those who are most vulnerable in our society. 5. Each human being is created in the image of God and is of infinite worth. 6. The earth belongs to God and is intrinsically good. 7. Christians have a biblical mandate to welcome strangers. 8. Those who follow Christ are called to heal the sick. 9. Because of the transforming power of Godâs grace, all humans are called to be in right relationship with each other. 10. Providing enriched learning environments for all of Godâs children is a moral imperative.  At the end of the list the document adds:  Finally, our religious tradition admonishes us not to bear false witness against our neighbor and to love our enemies. We ask that the campaigns of political candidates and the coverage of the media in this election season be conducted according to principles of fairness, honesty and integrity.  (To download the complete pdf document, click  urlLink here .)   A number of these principles are strikingly similar to some of the Quaker testimonies, particularly the first one: âwar is contrary to the will of Godâ. The document notes that there might be times wherein force is required, but only as a last resort and in rare circumstances (a sort of narrower, stricter interpretation of the Just War principle, I guess). Nonetheless, the fact that a major Christian ecumenical organization would declare such a principle is still remarkable. Part of the work of the â urlLink Every Church a Peace Church â is to assist individuals and congregations to learn, meditate on, and move towards a Peace Church stance.    If thereâs one point that the historic Peace Churches ( urlLink Church of the Brethren ,  urlLink Mennonite ,  urlLink Friends ) are accurate about is that Christ taught and lived peace. To follow him and his ways is to be one whose actions and attitudes are full of peace. These days this sort of individual would be labeled a âpacifistâ. It saddens the heart that the religion named after Jesus is associated with warfare. Pacifism is associated with several other world religions. Many people equate pacifism to  urlLink Buddhism , for example. It is a failure of the church that this can not be said for Christianity.

      My wife and I attended a feminist-christian community for about 5 years. It was a lovely place to be most of the time, but one night the pastor referred to G-d by the name, âOh, Delicious One.â I thought I would fall from my chair and piss on myself.   (Thanks to mark at  urlLink Leaves a Mark  , July 16 post)    Our corporate culture prides itself on individualism, but it's the "team player" with the fixed smile who gets to be employee of the month.   (Barbara Ehrenreich, Op-Ed piece, New York Times, July 15, 2004 by way of Leaves a Mark)    Checking in again to see where our old favorites are:  â¢ Osama bin Laden: whereabouts unknown  â¢ Mullah Omar: whereabouts unknown  â¢ Abu Musab al-Zarqawi: whereabouts unknown  â¢ Iraqi weapons of mass destruction: whereabouts unknown â¦  â¢ The Anthrax killer(s): whereabouts unknown  â¢ The Ricin terrorists: whereabouts uknown  â¢ Numerous priceless historical artifacts in Iraq: whereabouts unknown â¢ Iraqi Oil: Secured! (actually, it turns out that maybe it is not all that secure)   (Thanks to  urlLink T. Rex's Guide to Life )    And that the greatest gift one person can give another is to just be human, warm, present, clear. The ordinary, done with intention and focus, is extraordinary--   (Thanks to Andi at  urlLink Ditch the raft )    Our immediate task around the world and in Iraq and Afghanistan is to bring those terrorists to justice. See, you canât talk sense to them. You canât negotiate with terrorists. You canât sit back and hope that somehow therapy will work and they will change their ways. Thatâs just not the way it is. We must engage the enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.  - George W. Bush, July 14, 2004, Waukesha, Wisconsin   Youâre familiar with the old written law, "Love your friend," and its unwritten companion, "Hate your enemy." Iâm challenging that. Iâm telling you to love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer, for then you are working out of your true selves, your God-created selves. This is what God does. He gives his bestâthe sun to warm and the rain to nourishâto everyone, regardless: the good and bad, the nice and nasty. If all you do is love the lovable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that. If you simply say hello to those who greet you, do you expect a medal? Any run-of-the-mill sinner does that. In a word, what Iâm saying is, "Grow up." Youâre kingdom subjects. Now live like it. Live out your God-created identity. Live generously and graciously toward others, the way God loves toward you.  - Jesus, around 30-33 AD, Israel, as quoted in  urlLink The Message   [see Matthew 5:43-48]   (Thanks to Candace by way of  urlLink the christian agnostic)

       urlLink    Barbara  Jenna Bush  Ever since seeing   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11   a question has lingered in my mind: why havenât the Bush twins volunteered to serve in the military given the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and with the War on Terrorism?  Granted, sixty, even thirty years ago, there werenât many options for young women to serve their country through the military forces. But, times have changed. Weâve had substantially more women killed, injured, captured, and even involved with the abuse of prisoners.   In the past, it was normative for the sons of leaders to join the ranks of the military (even facing combat on occasion!) to show support for their fathersâ objectives. So, given the change in status for women in the military, and given the objectives of President George W. Bush and his administration,  and  given the age of Jenna and Barbara Bush, why havenât they volunteered their efforts to the military?

      Over at Quaker Ranter, Martin describes, while at this year's Friends General Conference ( urlLink FGC )  urlLink Gathering , encountering other Friends with similar issues and concerns regarding the liberal branch of Friends here in the U.S. The post is of particular note since he  urlLink quotes  me, yes, little-old-humble-I-would-never-toot-my-own-horn-me, in the process. {ahem}  Martin explains how he wondered how best to describe himself and decided that he was someone who was (to quote him directly) "in the âliberalâ branch of Friends who holds âconservativeâ values (I mean these terms in their theological sense, as descriptive terms that refer to well-defined historical movements)" . He eventually decided on the term âconservative-leaning, liberal Friendâ. (For an excellent example of Conservative Friends in the U.S. see the link for North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) on the side-bar; or, hey, just click  urlLink here !)  Thatâs what Iâve been labeling myself for about a year now!  Martin is clear about his sense of pride in what liberal Friends have accomplished including their efforts at being one of the first religious bodies to be as welcoming to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered individuals as any other in this world. He even notes that a number of lgbt Quakers are self-avowed Christians (typically of a more liberal, progressive type, but not always, I might add).  I wonder if one of the reasons that there are more Christians amongst sexuality and gender minorities is partly because giving up our faith of origin was not as much a luxury as it was for many heterosexual Friends. Many of us never wanted to give up our faith of origin, but the decision was made for us a long time ago by the larger religious community. (Thankfully, however, there has been substantial change amongst a number of Christian and Jewish organizations in regards to this.) We found solace, healing, and renewal amongst liberal Friends; and with this came an appreciation for our faiths-of-origin, albeit as understood by liberal Quakers.   And yet, for me at least, I finally feel confident enough amongst liberal Friends to challenge some of the norms and misapprehensions amongst us that I fear inadvertently undermines what makes Quakerism unique  within the Judeo-Christian tradition . Perhaps, liberal Friends need to take a cue from the renewal of tradition that appears to be happening amongst our Jewish counterparts within the  urlLink Reform Movement .   What canst thou say liberal Friends? Well?

      Hereâs something of interest that I had never known: along with citizens and immigrants of Japanese descent, citizens and immigrants of German and Italian descent were placed under curfew, deported, as well as put into internment camps (particularly on the west coast, mid-west, and in Texas) after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S.â official entrance into WWII. By far, those of Japanese descent had substantially larger numbers and longer periods of such treatment. Nonetheless, I was very surprised to learn of a documentary entitled    urlLink Una storia segreta (quando essere italiani era un crimine)    chronicling the similar experiences of Italians and Italian-Americans in the U.S. at that time.   Unfortunately, this type of response towards certain groups continues after the horrible attacks of September 11th. Muslims and Arab-Americans report and face  urlLink suspicions, threats, and prejudice  even to this day. I acknowledge that Iâve had some of these very same fears and suspicions. Now that I know that the same happened to U.S. citizens and immigrants of Italian descent some 60 years ago, I have a greater empathy and understanding of what many Muslims and Arab-Americans are experiencing today.

       urlLink     They make a fine looking couple, donât they? To see more check  urlLink here . Apparently, some folks in the conservative camp of the U.S.A. find this affection between two potential âworldâ leaders to be a tad disconcerting. Hugo Schwyzer offers a lengthy and intelligent  urlLink response  to these âconcernsâ. Hugo opines that the criticims regarding the affection shown between Kerry and Edwards is less a question of homophobia, since no one believes that either man is homosexual, and more an issue of interpreting open affection between men as a sign of vulnerability (read: weakness).  Although I basically agree with Hugo's analysis of the situation, I would add that the characteristic of "vulnerability" tends to be associated with "femininity" and hence with females (girls and women). Added to this is the historical tendency to view femininity in men as indicative of homosexuality. Thus, even though there might not be an overt implication of questioning either Kerryâs or Edwardâs sexuality, by virtue of the fact that they behave in a way that has traditionally been suggestive of homoeroticism implies that the two men are at least showing poor judgement. In fact, the  urlLink blog  that first caught Hugo's attention to the topic uses the word âgropingâ (as in:  âDrudge has photo montage of the two Johns groping and cuddling each other at a photo opportunity.â ) to describe the affection between the two candidates. The word âgropingâ is typically used in a sexual sense as is often heard by women when they complain of men trying to âgropeâ them.   On the other hand, I agree with Hugo about how our culture responds to this kind of affection between two men, regardless of the sexuality of either of them. This is as much a cultural issue of the "norms" of how two people of the same sex should behave with each other as it  regarding "vulnerability" in men or homophobia. For example, in my Italian-American family I donât think a time goes by that my father, brother, or I donât hug and kiss each other every time we get together. The love and affection that these two men have shown me is one of the most important and precious things in my life.

       urlLink Ex-gay Watch   has an excellent post as well as  urlLink discussion  on the fluidity of sexual orientation.  urlLink Steve Boese  offers an insightful and thought provoking essay about the nature of sexual orientation. He suggests that sexual orientation is best understood as having two dimensions:   Kinsey may have put orientation on a single scale from gay to straight, but I'm more inclined to think there are at least two relevant scales. The second one is the fluidity/flexibility scale.  While we find it most fitting to describe our baseline as gay, straight, or in between, the tendency to flex and bend also has a baseline and may shift at times over the course of a lifetime. There are probably a sizable percentage with little or no flexibility, some with moderate flexibility or phases in which fluidity spikes for a while, and a few with a lot of it.   The ânature/nurtureâ debate over the origins of sexual orientation has gone on for at least 100 years. The ex-gay movement clearly sides with the argument that sexual orientation (at least for anything that is same-sex oriented) as only due to environmental (and spiritual) factors. The gay rights movement asserts that it is solely due to nature (or at least should be framed in this way for political purposes). Yet, Kinsey offered a different framework: of sexual/romantic attraction as being a range of experiences across individuals.   Perhaps this orientation is âfluidâ (as Boese puts it) and has has a range to it as well. Some individuals find that their sexuality is more âfluidâ (either throughout the majority of their lives or sometimes only during a certain period or periods of life) than others. This apparent fluidity might be a proxy for how much ânatureâ and ânurtureâ impacts someoneâs sexuality. For some, nature might have the predominant influence: hence, these individuals experience their orientations as more âfixedâ. For those wherein ânurtureâ is the predominant influence, they experience their orientation are being more âfluidâ.  I commend Boese for willingly discussing this issue especially on a site such as Ex-gay Watch given the ongoing debates about the âchangeabilityâ of sexual orientation. Bravo!

      I went to two barbecues for the 4th of July. Despite my ambivalence regarding feeling patriotic, feasting on great salads, hamburgers, and ice cream sundays made any inner turmoil feel all better again.  The second barbecue I attended was hosted by a couple from my local Friends meeting. Many members and attenders were there to share in the food and viewing of the cityâs (both legal and illegal) fireworks high up in the Baldwin Hills.  After the fireworks had ended, several Friends started a conversation with me about the Bible study and worship sharing group that I had started about a year ago at the Meeting.   I use the  urlLink Friendly Bible Study   format that is ideal for a Meeting of liberal, unprogrammed Friends. About ten years ago I had been introduced to it at the previous  urlLink Friends Meeting  that I had belonged to before transferring membership to my present Meeting. Initially I had been leery of attending given that I had a ten year history of involvement with Christian fundamentalism from mid-adolescence until I was about 25 years old. My participation in the group was surprisingly very rewarding. Suddenly, I had a new approach for reading and studying the Bible that included an opportunity to struggle with my understanding of what the verses meant, any new insights gained, as well as any difficulties or outright offenses I might have with it. It helped to be introduced to this approach with a group of Friends who were comfortable reading and studying the Bible together, and who also role-modeled how to depend on the Spiritâs guidance through the entire process.  I have attended the present Meeting I am a member of for about five years. It is decidedly more  urlLink universalist  than the previous Meeting that I had belonged to. The positive thing about this is its efforts to be very inclusive to individuals who have been hurt by other religious institutions. The negative side is that it can inadvertently be antagonistic towards the Judeo-Christian (particularly the Christian part) tradition. Thus, when some Friends and attenders found out about my background with the Bible and had expressed an interest in doing a Bible study I was both surprised and hesitant.   I felt lead to seek the guidance of the Meetingâs  urlLink Ministry and Counsel  (M) as to whether the Meeting felt a desire to support a Bible study. M was very supportive, although the only self-identified Christian in the group made a point that the Meeting should not limit itself to the Bible, but to other holy books. I said nothing at the time, but disagreed with this assertion because of the foundational nature the Bible holds for Friends versus other holy books. I found it odd that the self-identified Christian should assert this; it seemed almost as if it was an apology to the others, as if it were a way to âproveâ that us Christians arenât so narrow minded after all.  So the study has been going on for about a year. Those who have regularly attended are pleasantly surprised. A few who clearly treat the Bible as literature and metaphor, which I do myself in some ways, have contributed the most. Each of us is gaining a bit more understanding on how early Friends found the Bible to be a resource and guide for their faith and practice. Weâve also noticed that any insights that do come up tend to be much richer and satisfying when done as a group versus what any one of us as individuals could do on our own.  Back to the Friendly barbecue â as stated before I was approached by several members of the Meeting regarding the Bible study. One of them paused, and then asserted, âI have to be honestâ¦â I knew, then, what was coming. The conversation turned into the merits of the Bible (âisnât it all just a matter of personal interpretationâ; âhasnât it been used as a way to oppress othersâ) and of having a Bible study in a Friendsâ Meeting (âbut, early Friends didnât believe in the Bibleâ). In fact, one member stated very clearly that having a Bible study was wrong.   None of their concerns were a surprise to me; Iâve had many of the same myself. What did surprise me was how long it took members to finally approach me with their âconcernsâ (a Friendly euphemism for being in complete disagreement with another). They seemed to be taking the Bible too literally. Yet, instead of treating it as the infallible Word of God, they were treating it as a reprehensible treatise that resulted in the moral and ethical failure of millions of people! Afterwards, I found it interesting that none of these individuals had yet come to one of the studies (although one person has internally struggled to get there). And it wasnât as if any of them were new to Quakerism; some had been involved with the Religious Society of Friends (RSoF) much longer than I had.  But, these âconcernsâ highlight some of the major problems and failings that I find for those of us in the liberal camp of Quakerism (at least in the U.S.). We have very little to no knowledge of the Bible, other than the âthroat crammingâ tactics of rabid televangelists or simplistic and prejudicial assertions of those who have, for various reasons for which I can sympathize with, left Christianity for its oppressive institutions and bloody history. It is true - Christianity has a horrid past of bloodshed and oppression. When I was attending a fundamentalist church I was taught some of the very theology that could prompt such behaviors; and I have struggled to wrest myself from it for many years.   Nonetheless, I came to one major insight while participating in the Friendly Bible Study group at my former Meeting. How did Friends come to such different conclusions (e.g. gender and racial equality, the Light in all people, pacifism, community discernment without the need for ritual or a professional clergy) when much of Christendom had come to the exact opposite conclusions? Yes, Iâm aware that the Bible has its contradictions. In fact, it has tons of them! But, that wasnât what grabbed and held early Friends. It was their direct experience of God, without the benefit of an official liturgy, professional clergy, and official doctrinal statement. And yet, they found their spiritual experiences and conclusions mirrored and confirmed in the Bible, the very book used to support all sorts of wars and subjugation of all sorts of people over the centuries (including early Quakers!).   I doubt that I changed any minds during our lengthy, but respectful conversation. But, unlike what seems like the opinion of the majority of liberal Friends, where personal and corporate revelation is the sole arbiter of faith, I believe that individuals and groups need far more than that to keep us from deteriorating into a âleast-common-denominatorâ, sentimental faith that tries to be all things to (most) everybody (as long as they agree with our politics). I believe that Friends have a rich history to draw from, which includes our present Faith  Practice (along with past Fâs), the writings and testimony of previous generations, and (hold your breath) the Bible. I have limited experience with  urlLink Conservative Friends , but this seems to be their approach on things as well, because of their respect for their Books of Discipline (both past and present), their respect for the traditions of Friends that make them unique from other Christian and religious groups, and their respect for the Bible as another albeit important and even fundamental source of guidance.

      Perhaps it is because of the upcoming presidential elections and the controversy that surrounds President Bush and his administration that I have been thinking about patriotism a bit more of late. Of course given that today is the 4th of July doesnât hurt the efforts of self-reflection either.   I read an interesting post by  urlLink Hugo Schwyzer  regarding patriotism. Despite his progressive politics he finds that he swells with patriotic pride on the 4th.  And yet, for me, it is a day of ambivalence. I was a kid during the turbulent late-1960âs. I remember when it was a joke to be patriotic for the United States. In fact, while watching Michael Mooreâs film  urlLink Farenheit 9/11 , I wondered if his film would have been hooted and howled at if it had been shown back in the late-1960âs. For example, Moore makes certain to not cast too much blame on the rank and file soldier. There is an underlying theme of patriotism, which is in evidence when Moore asserts that the policies of the Bush Administration are undermining what makes the U.S. great. It is as if Moore were attempting to grab the feeling of being patriotic back from the (almost exclusive) clutches of the conservatives.  My gal-pal  urlLink Teresa  recently observed that one of the main legacies of President Reagan was that he made being patriotic respectable again in the United States. (I guess quite a number of pundits lauded the same thing during the week of mourning after President Reagan's death, but I hadnât paid much attention given that I didnât remember his time in office as being quite so glorious. On the other hand, Iâd much rather have President Reagan back in office than this present administration.)  Nonetheless, I remain ambivalent about being patriotic on this yearâs 4th. Given my strong disagreement with President Bushâs international policies, the âpre-emptiveâ strike doctrine, and his insistence on courting the Religious Right, I donât feel so proud to be an American. Every time I visit  urlLink Iraq Body Count   I shudder; and this âonlyâ lists the range of casualties amongst civilians: it doesnât list soldiers killed or all those, whether military personnel or civilian, who have been maimed and/or traumatized by the war.

      Finally, I've JOINED the world of blogging. My dearest friend  Teresa  admonished me to do so years ago; I have finally obeyed her. Whether this will add anything of substance to the big world of blogging is anyone's guess (although certainly not mine).

       urlLink     From the  urlLink   "Demotivators Collection"    (their great tag line is the title of this post).  As Michelle over at  urlLink  nervous   explains why she loves "Demotivators":     I love how Despair, Inc. really hits the nail on the head for a lot of people. Some of us are fed up with cute motivational posters hanging in the office...  Yep.   And thanks to Michelle for the reference for this wonderful site. If you have ever seen other sites that market "motivational materials" (Hallmark meets the human potential movement) then you'll understand how perfectly Despair, Inc. mimics them.

      My gal-pal friend Teresa O over at  urlLink  In Sequence (a web log about the sequenital arts)   posted a lovely announcement about beppeblog. At one point she notes:    The focus is mainly on spirituality, however. Reading his blog is really mind-blowing for me, because it makes me realize that when he's not on the phone with me demanding that I watch  America's Next Top Model , he's thinking deep thoughts about the Good Book. Such are the complexities of the human soul.   Confession (AKA "full disclosure"): it is true, much to my own further humbling of spirit, that I have and do indulge in watching  urlLink  certain    urlLink  "reality"    urlLink  TV    urlLink  shows  . But, this hasn't distracted me  too  much in my efforts toward spiritual growth. {ahem}   OK, I'll admit it more explicitly:  My name is Joe and I am a closet "reality" TV show viewer.  "Hi, Joe!"  Sometimes people know you too well... {sigh}

      A PRAYER TO MARY LUKE TOBIN*  Pray for me to be a real good hermit and listen to the word of God and respond like a man. That is what it really involves: simply to stand on one's feet before one's Father and reply to Him in the Spirit.  This business about replying to the Father in the Spirit may sound like big talk but I don't mean it that way. "In the Spirit," in any context I know of, means flat on your face.  How can one stand on one's own feet and be flat on one's face at the same time is a mystery I will have to try to work out by living it.  * Sister Mary was president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious and one of only fifteen women invited to attend the Second Vatican Council.

       urlLink  Camassia   continues to post her impressions of John Yoderâs book  urlLink  The Politics of Jesus  . In her  urlLink  4 August post  , entitled âFight the Powers that beâ she writes:      Today, when "Question Authority" is mass-produced on a bumper sticker, and everybody wants to stand with the Little Guy against the Powers, the problem isn't so much that no one is questioning the Powers so much as that no one can agree on who they are. Everyone thinks they're an outgroup these days. The poor feel oppressed by the rich and the rich feel oppressed by the government, liberals complain that conservatives control business and conservatives complain liberals control the media and education, libertines complain of being censored while puritans feel they're losing the culture war, and so on and so forth. The temptation isn't so much to worship the Powers as it is convincing yourself that whatever you're already doing is standing with Jesus against the Powers.     Wow!  This reminded me of a very interesting workshop that I had attended at Friends General Conference ( urlLink  FGC  ) more than ten years ago. The focus was to study the Bible from different perspectives (e.g. feminist, creation spirituality, Liberation Theology) and how these different perspectives illuminated or contrasted with how early Friends approached the scriptures.  The day that the group was given a basic introduction to Liberation Theology the workshop leader used Maryâs âMagnificatâ (Luke 1:46-55) as an example of Liberation Theologyâs assertion that the Bible describes a God who shows preferential regard for those that are the most vulnerable in a society (in this case, the poor). The specific verses regarding this read:      51. The Lord has used his powerful arm to scatter those who are proud. 52. He drags strong rulers from their thrones and puts humble people in places of power. 53. God gives the hungry good things to eat, and sends the rich away with nothing.     The workshop leader then asked an intriguing question. Where did we, who had grown up middle-class and white (all of the attendees were people of European descent and from middle-class backgrounds) in one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations of the world, âpositionâ ourselves in these verses? Did we consider ourselves as one of those who was humble and hungry or as one of those who was proud and rich? She explained that Liberation Theology tended to interpret the Bible from a communal perspective rather than reading it as a text that was designed solely for an individualâs personal illumination. Thus, if we viewed these verses at a purely individualistic level, most of us might think of ourselves as one of those whom God protects and loves; or at least as one of those who was on the side of the âlittle guyâ (along with God) against the powers (of the world). Yet, when taken from a larger, systemic perspective, as a  group  we easily could be lumped in with those labeled âproudâ, âstrongâ, and ârichâ for, after all, each of us had lived and continued to live a relatively privileged existence compared to the worldâs âhumbleâ, âpoorâ, and âvulnerableâ.  Several people were unhappy with this interpretation. They asserted that God viewed everyone equally; that is was unfair to âlumpâ all Americans into the same group; that the notion that the Divine shows a âpreferenceâ of one group over another was antithetical to Friendsâ belief that everyone had the Inward Light within them.  But, the workshop leader held to her point by asking us to consider how we might, if each of us had been born in a poor, mostly agrarian and traditional culture, view an Americanâs status in the world. If we had been born into such âlowlyâ circumstances wouldnât it make sense to view those born in the U.S. as being ârichâ and having greater power in the world? As people trailed out of the room it seemed that few were convinced that, given all that each of them had suffered in their lives and/or had done as individuals to fight for social justice, that they could still be viewed as one of those âpowerfulâ, âhaughtyâ, ârichâ folks brought down by God in order to liberate those who had been humbled and made low by the âpowersâ of the world. People seemed much more energized by what feminist and creation spirituality perspectives had to offer on other days during the week-long workshop.  Nonetheless, the idea has stayed with me. And it seems to be echoed in what Camassia so nicely states in her post. I wonder how often I have made my political and social views into idols so that I can feel that I am on the âcorrectâ side of an issue. At a broader level how many times do we (liberal) Friends in the U.S. think of ourselves as being on the side of the âlittle guyâ fighting âagainst the powersâ when, in fact, we might actually be on the other side of the equation, which includes self-righteousness, sanctimoniousness, pride, and privilege? Do we   truly   believe that there is a greater Truth than our own political and social views?
