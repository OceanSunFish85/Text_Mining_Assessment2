       Here Without You      A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face   A thousand lies have made me colder and I donât think I can look at this the same   But all the miles that separate   They disappear now when Iâm dreaming of your face      Iâm here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind   I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time   Iâm here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams   And tonight, thereâs only you and me      The miles just keep rolling as the people leave their way to say hello   I've heard this life is overrated but I hope that this gets better as we go   Iâm here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind   I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time   Iâm here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams   And tonight girl, thereâs only you and me      Everything I know, and anywhere I go it gets hard but it wonât take away my love   And when the last one falls, when itâs all said and done   it gets hard but it wonât take away my love      Iâm here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind   I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time   Iâm here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams   And tonight girl, thereâs only you and me      Iâm here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind   I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time   Iâm here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams   but tonight girl, thereâs only you and me

       yea these are kinda old but what the hell       One Last Poem   i wrote out my heart my feelings the things i thought and did i wrote to tell u things i wrote out all the things i wanted to say i wrote them out to express the feelings i had for u now im writing out the feelings im not supposed to have for u "She doesn't deserve someone as great as u...ull be better off with someone else" something said to try and comfort me when all i was thinking was she deserves someone better than me...and i don't want anybody else my first love now gone but not the love i have for them the love im supposed to lose the love i can't have... but why can't i have it no reason was given other than thats the way the world works and i have to...forget love shes a motherfucker eh... love that was my mistake i could be attracted to her just not love her love that was my mistake how many times has love ever been a mistake when everythingâs meant to be broken ironic I said you could have this heart to break so you took advantage of that âyou set your self up for heartbreakâ maybe I did but I didnât expect it to hurt like this a hurt that ive felt before but never this bad its not as bad when they never liked you in the first place a hurt that you canât describe a deep hurt hurtâ¦ so I'm writing these things out in one last poem to you one last poem written for you about you with you in my mind before I begin my road toâ¦ forgettingâ¦â¦       Walking     Ive walked a long lonely road Walked it many times Then I met you and the road wasnât so lonely I could walk with you Tell you they way I feel Talk about things I wouldnât tell anyone else But then you changed roads So suddenly you changed And then I stood for a while But all I could do is keep walking Down this lonely road

        Holding    As we walk together   I smile at you   and you smile back   we hold hands   but little do you know   you hold more then just my hand   you hold up my heart   you hold up my spirit   you help me heal   you help me stay together   I walk with you   and smile   knowing that you hold more   than just my hand      Wee this has been another boring day at home.....sitting playing video games reading, running, gaaaaaa!!!!!! its so monotonous........blah.......you would think that i was the one spending the time making virtual water balloon fights instead of other people ::coughsarahcoughcough:: but oh well in some strange way im looking forward for school to start

Alone   I felt happy when we first connected   now i feel...   like a used toy   cast aside by a child   done playing with it   I feel...   alone   after all we'd shared   all we'd done   it ends with a half assed hug   and not even a goodbye   leaving me feeling   alone      ill prob put more on eventually
