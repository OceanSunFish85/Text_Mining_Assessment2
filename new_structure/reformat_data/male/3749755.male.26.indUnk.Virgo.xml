       Aha! Is Python language so easy to implement? We already got Python itself on normal platform and Jython on Java. Now, there is even more --  urlLink IronPython  on .NET and Mono.  I have thought more about it -- what's the benefit from such a implementation? Jython talked a lot on this issue, but it's already partly dead.  (UPDATE) Today, when rereaded some articles about IronPython, I was noticed that its author is  urlLink Jim Hugunin . Who's him?  I'm the creator of JPython/Jython, the co-designer of the AspectJ language and chief architect for its compiler and related tools, and the creator of Numeric Python/NumPy.  Everything is obvious now.

        urlLink del.icio.us   Amazing! Just sucscribe the  urlLink popular link  with my RSS aggregator, I would know interesting websites that ppl readed. And, of course, I wouldn't need to copy my bookmarks.html from home to anywhere.  Note: I also tried  urlLink Furl . It use the similar idea with del.icio.us, and provide a better organized interface. Obviously, the number of furl users is less than del.icio.us currently, I haven't decided which one is the best to me.  Update: After digging in Furl several hours, I knew more about Furl. Most are cons. 1. Open a random page in d... and the corresponding one in f..., you can get more information from the first one. 2. When bookmark a page, Furl allows me to create only one Topic instead of several Topics in delicious. 3.  Sidebar , yes, the righthand-sidebar is really easy to use, much much better than Furl's ComboBox.

       I searched in Google to find explanations about blogger API. They all said that the first line in content would be treat as title. But, neither gnome-blog nor blogtk could post in this way. That is to say that all known blogger client can't write title, except Blogger's BlogThis!.  So, what's the problem? Or, did I miss something?

       Yes, I reopened it. 1. The button wouldn't open the new popup window. 2. The title always set to incorrect "undefined".   urlLink Bug 6497 - Blogger button doesn't open up in a popup window like BlogThis and is named incorrectly.

        urlLink Asus Anti-Linux Attitude Sucks- MozillaQuest Magazine   Perhaps, the author is too sensitive, but Asus is really stupid in this case. They should learn something from Nvidia who didn't provide open source driver but still maintain a good relation with open source community.

       At 5:00am, I received a call from Marie who came back from China.  When I drove in the motorway at 100km/h, it's great fog. Sometimes, I can't even see the object that 20 meters ahead. Later, things became even worse -- the right head-light of my car was broken. :( When off highway, the road was narrow without any road-light, and most cars are 80+km/h. Horrible.  After the dangerous trip, I saw Marie eventually. Hey, surprising, she is a really beautiful girl now, or more beautiful than ever. And, Chinese fashion style make me feel comfortable. ^_^  On the road to home, speed wasn't high, because many ppl were driving to work. Fortunately, we arrived home safely.

        urlLink Gentoo MacOS ! A nice way to build software from scratch on MacOS. And don't forget the  urlLink Fink Project  which is maturer and base on Debian. I could imagine the distro war on Mac now.

       I readed the news that  urlLink Doom 3   urlLink has landed in New Zealand  recently. It's a long wait for many many game players, but not for me. I'm never a FPS man. This kind of underground shooting game would make me dizzy. Counter-Strike is probably a better one than DOOM, Quake and Half-Life, because most of its scenes are under the sky, not in the dark building and tunnel.  Have fun!
