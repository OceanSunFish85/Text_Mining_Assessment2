      After the death of Ronald Reagan, and watching his funeral on television,  Iâve been thinking about that time in which he was President.  These years, I was a young man in high school, about to face the world.  Ronald Reagan was a very likeable man.  I think I might have enjoyed sitting down and having a drink with him, discussing our views.  I imagine him respecting me even when I disagreed with him, yet being very persuasive. The many stories Iâve heard confirm just that.  He was able to get people on his side on a bipartisan level never since equaled.  There's something to be said for a background in acting, and I hope I can possess even some of those qualities.    Still, there are many who cannot get over the fact that he completely overlooked the AIDS crisis for seven years, until 1987.  The general political response was that AIDS only affected homosexuals and IV drug users, so the general public need not worry.  The implication was that those people did not matter, but they did, and many are not here today.  But, you know what?  I can cut Ronald some slack by knowing he was a good man, but a man of his time.  The entire world was less tolerant twenty years ago, and times have changed.  Or have they?  Today, our President does seem to be aware of and concerned about the AIDS crisis around the world, and is doing something about it. This is definitely a good thing.  I mean, it is now common knowledge that this virus does not discriminate.    Unfortunately, people still do.  We still have overly harsh drug laws, and a congress that is considering amending the US Constitution to specifically define marriage in order to exclude same sex couples who wish to build a life together.  The current President backs such an amendment, while his challenger in the next election has a slightly better idea, but not by much.  So, I am led to believe that the sentiment is that these people still do not matter. Why is there such hatred for people who love in a different way?  And why are addicts treated like vile criminals who deserve what they get, instead of people with a problem that need help?   I mean, we have first time juvenile offenders doing hard time in adult prisons.  Who benefits from this?  Would Ronald Reagan support this today?  The man I have heard discussed recently would not.  He said that everyone mattered.

      I just got out of rehearsal for Much Ado About Nothing.  I tell you, I love working on Shakespeare more than anything else.  With Shakespeareâs amazing words up on their feet, adding behavior and intention, there is nothing that makes me feel more alive.  Being that I am playing Don John, I went in trying to be cautious of not playing a stereotypical generic villain.  But with the strong direction of Lisa Jackson, whoâs helped me to find a specific, strong point of view, and the skillful, giving talent of my scene partner, Brian Flegel- they are making my job so easy that it actually seems unfair.  Shakespeare was a master of words, and words are truly powerful things.  Elizabethan audiences reveled in the joy of sound the way we do visuals today.  They would go to âhearâ a playâ¦ very much the way we would âseeâ a film today.  It was an âaudioâ society- hence the word âaudienceâ.  But I do believe that words and language can be as powerful today as they were then.  For the Elizabethans, the art of debate was a primary component of their education.  They would have to effectively argue for both sides of an issue before they could pass.  I really believe that if more of us could do this today, we would all be closer to finding the truth about things.   For the truth is that there are two sides to every story, and that each side usually has at least some validity for most subjects.  I especially believe that our politicians, political commentators, and even our media would gain much by studying Shakespeare, who was the master of rhetoric and was incredibly insightful when it came to seeing both sides of any coin.

      Yesterday, after getting out of rehearsal, a few of us went to see Fahrenheit 911. Michael Moore makes a very good case for his views, if you already agree. My complaint about this film is that he is mostly preaching to the choir, and does little to sway those with opposing views or those on the fence.  Still, I believe it is important for us to see many of the strong images in this film, even if I am not entirley ready to agree with every single thing he says.  The first thing that the film brought up was that in the 2000 election, when the Supreme Court decided to stop the recounts and declare Bush the winner, it would have taken only one senator to challenge that decision, and NOT ONE of them signed.  This includes Democratic senators that I voted for.  Now, I remember thinking then that if it had happened the other way â if Bush had gotten the popular vote and Gore the Electoral vote and thus the Presidency, I would have had nothing to say.  So I decided to accept the fact that I didnât get what I wanted that time.  Still, many of my friends to this day complain that Bush stole the election.  But I am now also forced to wonder if it wasnât given to him when it could have been so easily contested.  Also, I know someone who works within the Energy industry in Houston, Texas.  He is someone I think very highly of, and have known him to have spoken up against financial greed.  I would be hard pressed to believe that he would be part of any business that wasnât doing something good.  Now, Moore only mentions a few specific corporations, but I can see how someone without the proper perspective might come out with the impression that the entire Energy industry in Houston is a breeding ground of corruption.  And I can certainly imagine how my friend and his colleagues might take exception to that.  So, let us just keep in mind that a few bad apples does not mean the entire orchard is rotten.  After all, we do need oil and other sources of energy to maintain our daily lives.  The fact is that you can find dishonesty within any field.  The most powerful part of the movie for me was the mother, whose son was a soldier who gave his life in Iraq, reading the final letter she received from him, in which he criticizes Bush for having him and his fellow troops there.  It was during this moment that, while I usually enjoy seeing movies alone, I was very grateful to have friends with me.  I donât think I would have been okay alone.  He makes an excellent case for what Iâve believed from the beginning: that to oppose the war in Iraq, while supporting our troops is not at all contradictory.  And to disagree with our leadersâ actions is not to âhate our countryâ.   In fact, people have given their lives so that we may have the right to disagree, and say so.  When I am convinced that the young men and women, many not even old enough to drink, who step up to serve our country, are being put in harmâs way for no good reason, my right to voice my dissent extends itself to a responsibility.  I would encourage every American to see this film, no matter what their views may be.  There are things to think about, and if you disagree or know the truth to be otherwiseâ¦SPEAK UP!!! I AM LISTENING AND WANT TO HEAR. TELL ME WHAT I AM MISSING.  I would, however, caution those who have not studied the issues not to rely on this film as their sole source of information.  Do the work!     Well, I guess this was more a reflection than a review, butâ¦â¦  Oh, one side noteâ¦  Today in the Daily News, Bill OâReillyâs column headlined, âMoore has shaky hand on âtruthâââ¦  he proceeds to refute one point that was made in the movie.  Turn a few pagesâ¦  Jack Mathews column headlines, âHide this Bill OâReillyâ  where, in his column, he proceeds to point out that the media watchdog group, Media Matters for America (www.mediamatters.org) has found OâReilly to have altered the truth on at least three different occasions.  They have also offered to appear on his show, but have not received an answer.   Something to think about.

      As for domestic political issues, the one that concerns me most right now is the Patriot Act.  Does is make sense for anyone to say, âIn order to protect our liberty and freedoms, we must be willing to sacrifice some of our liberty and freedoms.â  ???  I understand that desperate times call for desperate measures.  And when Bush says, âI am not interested in protecting the rights of terroristsâ, I would have to agree.    But, without due process, without checks and balances, how do we guard against mistakes?  We have already seen this happen in Oregon.  Right now, all our government has to do is suspect you are a terrorist, and they can raid your confidential records, read your email, medical and school transcripts- not only without a warrant, but also without your knowledge.  Then can then hold you indefinitely, without charging you, giving you a trial, or any due process.  Yes, we must do what we can to protect ourselves from terrorists, but mistakes can be made. It can happen to me, you, or someone we care about.  Surely there must be a better way than sacrificing our civil liberites.  If we discard the liberties and freedoms this country was founded on, then what is left to fight for?  In fact, what is left to live for?

      There was a time when I felt that it was inappropriate for celebrities to voice their political views.  I now realize why it is necessary.  When we think of any establishment, whether it be a company, a corporation, a product, or a country, we put a face to it.  That face represents what we believe about the establishment.  The United States of America is probably the most diverse place in the world.   The more faces that represent us, the more the message of diversity comes across. One of the great thing about this country is that we can disagree with, debate, and question each other and our leaders.  In many parts of the world, these very things can get a person imprisoned or even killed.  Here, the worst that can happen to us is that someone will say, âGo f**k yourself!â (as a certain VP recently said to a certain senator this past week! I must say I was amused!)  I also used to keep my opinions to myself, for fear of offending anyone.  I would not tell friends when I disagreed with them on their political views, for fear of losing their friendship.  I finally realized that there are bigger issues in the world than my codependency, and that most reasonable people can agree to disagree.  Even more than that, I have found that by discussing, debating, and listening to others with differing and like viewpoints, I have become even better informed than I would be by just reading the newspaper.   This on-line journal is a great tool for me to exercise my right and responsibility as an American to share my views, and give opportunities for others to say to me, âGo f**k yourself!â

      At the restaurant today, I had a customer ask me if we had any other ketchup than  urlLink Heinz.   I said, âSorry, no, we only have Democratic ketchup!â  I assured him, jokingly, that we were using left over ketchup from when she was still a Republican!  He was surprised that I knew why he was asking and appreciatively told me that I was one of the few to have a sense of humor about his question.  I then shared with him what David Letterman said about Teresa Heinz Kerry telling a reporter to âshove itââ¦. âWho does she think she is?  Dick Cheney?!â    So, a Donkey and an Elephant shared a good laugh today!

      Having seen the first two  urlLink Lord of the Rings.  films with my Dad, he was unable to see the last one with me because of his declining health.  So, after Faire is over, I will make a special trip home to watch it with him.

        "To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."    -Theodore Roosevelt    It really hurts and angers me when I hear accusations that those of us who oppose our current president âhate our countryâ or are unpatriotic.  It is  because  we love our country so much that we feel the responsibility to speak up when things are going wrong.  Still, there are some liberals who fail to be reasonable, and I can see where some might question the left's patriotism.  Here in New York City, where the overwhelming opposition to Bush is in the very air we breathe, for one to admit they support him is a very dangerous thing.  In fact, the worst way to insult someone is to call them âPro-Bushâ.   I have found that when I say something in  urlLink defense of Bush , or even  urlLink critical of Michael Moore , I end up having to fend off an argument that has nothing to do with my point.   I thought liberals were supposed to be tolerant. Is this the message we all want to send? Let's be what we believe in.  Iâm tired of being angry.  I think people are more apt to listen if we are reasonable and logical when sharing our points of view.  Iâve been in an ongoing discussion about this with some of my friends.  My friend, David, put it much more eloquently than I was able tooâ¦.   âI'm with you on all of your thoughts Cary. I grew up in a liberal household with "minds are like parachutes. They only work when they're open" bumper stickers. I thought the left was open minded and the right was closed minded.   Then I came to New York . . . I've heard liberals (and more than a couple) tell me that they were GLAD they were closed minded, because they KNEW they were right. And this is just a tragedy.  I think the majority of my friends are dealing on some level with what I call "top to bottom" politics. Instead of looking at policies and seeing if they agree, they look at Bush (who they see as fundamentally flawed (no pun intended) and figure whatever he's saying is wrong. This is a terrible way of reasoning. If you were to break down his CURRENT policies in Iraq, I'd say most of us would agree with well over half of them. Let's just hope these policy changes aren't too late to fix the damage that has been done.  Now, I'm also offended that I have to say, "And I didn't vote for Bush, and I didn't think we should have gone to war in Iraq. He's made major mistakes etc." To ward off the venom you talked about in your first post.  But take heart. This is by NO MEANS the most divided politics has ever been. Our founding fathers (especially John Adams vs. Jefferson, Burr vs. Hamilton, and Jackson vs. Adams (I think, Jackson won the popular vote but lost the election)) not only fought over policies but called for each other to be considered traitors to the country and treated as such. The words, "traitor" or "un-American" are political rhetoric now. Back then, they MEANT it!â   I have a better idea. Let's make some buttons. Let's wear them when the  urlLink Republicans  come to town.  They could say such things as...   "Democrat for Democracy"    "I'm not Voting for Bush, but I support your right to"    "Ask me why I support Kerry"   This way, we can show that although we are opposed to our current leaders, we still believe in the process.  It seems to me that positive choices in politics would be just as valuable as they are in acting, and could make more of a difference.  Believe it or not, there are still things that Americans  urlLink agree on.   United we stand.

      Whether we agree with the decisions our leaders make or not, it is the young men and women in uniform, who willingly step up to serve our country, who are putting their lives on the line.  Each one of them deserves our utmost respect, admiration, and gratitude.  It is because people have fought and died for this great country that we can protest, rally, debate and vote.  I know not a single person, regardless of their political views, who does not pray, wish or hope for the safety of our troops and look forward to welcoming them when they return home.  In a country currently divided on many things, this is where we continue to stand united.  We can actively show our support by giving to  urlLink Operation Gratitude .  I currently know of two friends with family members serving in Iraq.    Oneâs jeep drove upon a roadside bomb, while my friendâs cousin, a solider there, watched two of his buddies die in front of him.  My friend says her family doesnât know where he is now, as they have not heard from him since May.   My other friend has a son over there, who has seen fourteen of his friendâs die in front of him.  I ask those of you who pray to please include Chaz Faller and Domingo Ozoria, as well as all of our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world.  They will need our support when they come home, as well as now.  They will not be the same.

      Well, the 9/ll Commission has published itâs  urlLink report .  And what do we find out?  Exactly what Iâve been saying:  We are no safer now than we were September 10th, 2001.  The commission has made suggestions to improve homeland security, which they say are urgent to implement.  I am glad to see that their suggestions do not fail to consider the  urlLink civil liberties  of American citizens.  Bush has promised to swiftly act upon the  urlLink  recommendations   of the panel.  But, with all of the the  urlLink obstacles  this administration has placed before the commission from the beginning, I am reluctant to believe that this is anything but political rhetoric.  I truly hope I'm wrong. As I believe he has a good chance of being reelected, we need to make sure his keeps his word on this.  Still, reading again about the many acts of the  urlLink heroism  that day reminded me of some of my own experiences.  My parents then asked me then if I wanted to leave New York and go home.  My answer was that I was home.  I remember stopping at one of the firehouses that had lost half their men, looking at their pictures, reading the letters, and walking away with tears in my eyes.  A total stranger approached me and asked, âAre you okay?â  This was the common behavior during that time.  The worst of man brought out the best in man.  I cannot lavish enough praise on Mayor Bloomberg for really fighting for funding to keep our city safe, even standing up to members of his own political party.  I may disagree with some of his beliefs as to why we have not gotten this funding, but that is inconsequential to the fact that he has been a true advocate and champion for New York City and is determined to get something done.   Even if I don't like every single thing he's doing, there is at least one lever in the Republican column that Iâll be pulling in the voting booth.

      I have been performing since I was 14 years old, which is more than half my life.  I have performed all over the country in front of hundreds of people, and I never ever have a problem.  I handle auditions fairly well, too.    But itâs when I have to perform for my fellow actors, in workshops and rehearsals, that I suddenly become paralyzed with fear!  Why is this?  The other night, I was talking to my friend  urlLink Deric , he said he thought I was very talented.  My response was that with all the incredible talent around me, I didnât feel like I was.  Iâm finding that I am much less secure off stage than on.  Is this normal?     Do other actors feel this?  Do other people feel this in other professions?  Why am I so terrified in front of the people who are the most supportive?  Everything seems to come so easy to the artists around me, while I really work my tail off just to keep up.  Of course these feelings all go away once Iâm in front of an audience.  Itâs the rehearsal process that is sheer torture.  This is the next thing I feel I need to explore within myself.  Any feed back on this would be helpful.

      I waited on some very nice ladies today from Flint, Michigan.  When I found this out, I seized the opportunity to ask them if it was as bad there as Michael Moore portrays.  Their answer was that although a particular portion of it is pretty seedy, not really.  Turns out that they were Conservative Republican Bush supporters.  Being that I am a Liberal Democrat Kerry supporter, we had quite a conversation.  We talked and debated for about fifteen to twenty minutes, each of us very open to what the otherâs views were.  I was so invigorated and caught up in this conversation, that I gave away a few of my other tables to coworkers, in order that I might continue. I was delighted to find that we actually agreed on more things than we disagreed on.  I am now much more optimistic about the future of America!    In the end, we agreed that we would not totally sway each other but that we had found a lot of common ground.  We also agreed that we could not talk about it if we did not go out and   vote .  I am now incredibly encouraged to know that while America remains divided on certain issues, we are still, for better or worse, united as Americans, and still stand proud.

      I was glad to see that Congress shot down the marriage amendment yesterday.    While I always say that people are entitled to their beliefs, as the constitution entitles us all to Freedom of Religion, it also promises equality for all people. AND we also have a Separation of Church and State. If a church decides not to marry any two individuals, it is their prerogative. I do not believe the government should have that same right.    Bushâs overwhelmingly vocal support of brazenly discriminating against homosexuals saddens and angers me. He says that giving same sex couples the right to marry would undermine the institution of marriage.    I say this -  Any relationship is as good as the two individuals involved in it are committed to it.  No outside force can validate or weaken it.      However, the fact that neither John Kerry nor John Edwards bothered to show up to debate this issue or vote doesnât sit well with me, either. They did issue a statement, however, that although they would have voted no on this amendment, they are against gay marriage. They do support âCivil Unionsâ    This is the very height of waffling! Come on, guys, leggo my eggo, I donât buy this shit.    Why am I against Civil Unions? Because I stand by what I believe regarding the power of language. Look up any word in any thesaurus, you willfind that each entry has a slightly different meaning. To call it something different is to imply that you believe it  is  different. And I do not believe that these guys see it at all as equal.    I read an article recently describing Kerry and Edwards as âMetrosexualâ. I shook my head in disbelief. This authorâs reasoning? They both wear expensive clothing and go to a top hairdresser! Give me a break. Look at Bush, Cheney, Kerry and Edwards;  Bush is the poorest of them all with 15 million dollars!!!  They should ALL have good haircuts! (Cheney is excused from this comment)    Trust me, you will not see any of these guys sitting down at the  urlLink Big Cup   in Chelsea!    But do not despair. Here is my prediction: This matter will not be solved by the President, Congress, or even the states. Within the next two years it will be before the United States Supreme Court. I truly believe that they will rule that to deny any two people a contract based on gender is discriminatory and unconstitutional.    That this issue is a topic in the presidential race is just silly. I say silly!

      Okay, well thatâs three posts, actually four. I get to write about politics again! I will never again give myself a restriction as to what to write about. I will write about what is on my mind, and if one subject ends up taking dominance, then so be it.    One particular thing on my mind is something that columnist Richard Cohen, once again, expresses much better than I can. So I, once again, post his column here.      New York Daily News - http://www.nydailynews.com   Tuesday, July 13, 2004    W fails to make me feel safer  By Richard Cohen      When it comes to telling you right to your face that black is white, maybe no one compares with George W. Bush. Last week, for example, he responded to yet another report that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction by saying that it didn't matter. "Although we have not found stockpiles of weapons, I believe we were right to go into Iraq," Bush said. "America is safer today because we did."   "America is safer today because we did." The statement is worth repeating because it ranks up there with the insistence that the sour East of Berlin out-dazzled the West. Just the day before, in fact, senior administration officials were saying that Osama bin Laden and his top guys were planning a terrorist attack in the United States sometime before the November presidential election. How's that for safer?   As always in these matters, no one knows what, if anything, will happen. As usual, New York, Washington and Los Angeles are high on the list of possible targets and so, too, are the national political conventions. Because duty calls me to both, I just want to take this moment to tell my president that I don't feel safe or safer. In fact, I have a sensible case of the jitters.   You will note that these senior administration officials did not merely say that al Qaeda was planning an attack. They specifically said bin Laden. This is the guy who Bush once vowed to get "dead or alive," but who, lo these three years later, we have not gotten at all. He resides, or so we are told, in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan and he does so because the United States failed to get him.   As John Kerry was among the first to point out, bin Laden survives because the Pentagon, distracted by planning the coming campaign in Iraq or maybe fearing that casualties would dampen enthusiasm for a wider war, left it to the Afghans to flush out bin Laden at Tora Bora. They did not do the job -- but, not to worry, it didn't matter anyway. Don Rumsfeld assured us nearly two years ago that wherever bin Laden is, "you can be certain that he's having one dickens of a time operating his apparatus." The U.S. ground commander in Afghanistan at the time was even more confident. "We don't have to find him," Lt. Gen. Dan McNeil said of bin Laden, "because we're going to shut down his terrorist apparatus."   But somehow, this terrorist whose capture did not matter all that much, whose apparatus would be shut down by Pentagon apparatchiks, has now caused much of Washington to break out in hives. The election may be interrupted. New York may be attacked. Still, we are safe. Check that: We are safer. In fact, we are both safe and not safe because, as the record makes clear, it is both important to get bin Laden and not important to get him -- depending, of course, on which mistake some nincompoop is trying to excuse.   The most solemn obligation of a president is to keep us safe. This is something Bush has not done. Not only did Sept. 11 occur on his watch but nearly 900 Americans have been killed in Iraq, a war that could have waited . . . maybe forever. At minimum, we could have used some allies besides Britain and we should have waited until bin Laden was either killed or captured.   Instead, we went after Saddam Hussein, who posed only the remotest of threats -- he had no weapons of mass destruction, his army was a shambles and he himself was insanely writing romantic potboilers -- and effectively ignored the man who is a threat and who had already killed thousands of Americans on Sept. 11. We've got Saddam Hussein; we don't have Osama bin Laden.   Yet, for reasons that totally escape me, I am supposed to feel safe or safer. I don't -- ... Bin Laden is still in the mountains and Bush, from what he is saying, is in denial.     Please, feel free to disagree with this. BUT, do consider my point: I live in New York City, I work directly across the street from Ground Zero. I was here on September 11th. Although I witnessed it happen from a safe distance on Staten Island, many people I know were in the thick of it. We remember that day well. I will tell you that the overwhelming majority of us feel exactly the way Mr. Cohen does. We believe that the War on Terror has gone off track. We do not feel safer.

      I first heard this joke from my friend, Justin Lewis.  He got it from another friend, Justin Thompson.  (they are both members of the  Silver Knights  joust team!)  This joke is best told with a Scottish accent, so try to imagine...    A Scottish old timer in Scotland, in a bar, talking to a young man.  Old Man speaks; "Lad, look out there to the field. Do ya see that  fence? Look how well it's built. I built that fence stone by stone with me own two hands. I piled it for months. But do they call me McGreggor-the Fence-Builder? Nooooo!"  Then the old man gestured at the bar.  "Look here at the bar. Do ya see how smooth and just it is? I planed  that surface down by me own achin' back. I carved that wood with me own hard labor, for eight days. But do they call me McGreggor-the Bar Builder? Nooooooo!"  Then the old man points out the window.  "Eh, Laddy, look out to sea... Do ya see that pier that stretches out  as far as the eye can see? I built that pier with the sweat off me back. I nailed it board by board. But do they call me McGreggor-the Pier-Builder? Nooooo!"  Then the old man looks around nervously, trying to make sure no one is paying attention and says: "But ya fuck one goat......"

      At the Ren Faire, we have a very popular show, called  The Living Chess Game .   This is where two primary characters, usually the Sheriff vs. Robin Hood, or Queen Elizabeth vs. Mary Queen of Scots, or some similar rival characters play a game of chess using live people as pieces. The characters/pieces then have to battle it out to win their square. Itâs quite a fun stage combat show, especially for Chess Geeks!   When I proposed my idea for my character to have a chessboard fight, I fully expected our Creative Director, Chris DeTroy to exclaim in his most eloquent way, âThatâs really stupid!â Much to my surprise, he liked the idea.   So, I next brought the idea to our Fight Director, Dan OâDriscoll. Basically, my idea was an homage to the Danny Kaye/Basil Rathbone swordfight from the classic film,  The Court Jester . My character,  Yorick the Court Jester  , would be called upon to fight and terrified out of his mind. He would then be hypnotized and come back swashbuckling like Errol Flynn! I fully expected Dan to politely wince, as he will do when he doesnât think something will work. But he too seemed to like the idea.   Dan then had to decide who would be best suited to be my partner. It would have to be someone will enough skill to make me look good, and who could be made a fool of without negating their character. The decision was that it would be Dan himself, as the pirate  Captain Jack âMad Dogâ Daniels!    This rather daunted me a bit! Dan is a highly skilled, accomplished fighter and fight director with many years experience. I have been studying and fighting for a few years, but relatively inexperienced. Working with him, I would have to really be on point.   I have found that putting this fight together with Dan has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I really thought that I would just be doing all the moves he gave me, but not so. He gives me phrases, but is still incredibly open to my ideas. It is a totally collaborative venture. In fact, his performance is so self-effacing, and totally supportive of mine, itâs a great lesson on what makes a good fighter/performer:  making your partner look good.    I donât know if this fight will work or not. But, if it doesnât, I cannot point the finger at my director, as I am as much part of the creative process. But if it does, I get to share the glory! In either case, I am learning an incredible amount!     Dan performs with the  urlLink Crimson Pirates !

      On weekdaysâ¦  I drag myself up out of bed early; take a shower, shave, etc.  I often have a bowl of cereal for breakfast.    Then I walk to the subway, grab a newspaper (anything but the NY Post) and read it on my way to work at the restaurant.  I get to work, do side work and wait tables.  When I am done, I grab a bite to eat, then I go to a secluded storage area to do my vocal warm-ups and light stretches to prepare for rehearsal that night.  I then hop on a subway, and go over my lines and/or music while in transit.  When I get to rehearsal, I chat with my cast mates usually about current events.  Then we rehearse.  Sometimes we go out for drinks afterwards, and sometimes I go straight home. I usually read a different newspaper on my way home, or chat with friends who live close by.  I usually then get home around 10 or 11, at which time I get on the computer to check my e-mail, read the news, and write in this web log. It was actually nice to get home a little early tonight.  On weekendsâ¦  I get up abnormally early to catch the cast bus that takes us up to faire site.  I spend my entire weekend there rehearsing and love being âincommunicadoâ with the outside world!  Alas, this doesnât seem like much, but it really usurps all of my free time. As I do not have a cell-phone, I have no time to call friends that I would really like to talk to.  This is why nobody has heard from me!  I donât even have time to do laundry!  (My roommate has been trying to convince me to use the laundry service, but Iâm still a bit uptight about that.  I may yet give in, though.)  I feel guilty when I think back to all the times I got upset with friends for not calling me or not having enough time for me.  Now the tables have turned, and I understand.  The little free time to do get, I value having for myself.  Still, I do get to talk to my best friend, Gary, on a somewhat regular basis, since I know itâs okay to call him very late at night.    Perhaps we could arrange to add an extra five hours to every day!  That certainly would be more convenient.   But then Iâm sure Iâd eventually find a way to fill those hours up, too!

      I've told myself to cool it with writing about politics for a while, as I did not want it to totally dominate this web log.    But I have some things to get off my chest.  First, let me be clearâ¦, The Presidential candidate I currently support is John Kerry.  I support him because he supports the majority of issues that are important to me.  This does not mean that I agree with him on everything.  Nor does this mean that I disagree with Bush on everything.  I absolutely refuse to count myself among those who call themselves âBush-Hatersâ.  The most valuable thing my parents ever taught me while growing up was that it is wrong to ever hate anyone.    Of course, I get angry.  And I have been known to let my anger, and other emotions, get the best of me and compromise who I am.  I have learned the importance of channeling my emotions to accomplish positive goals.  It is not easy, and I do not always succeed, but I try very hard.  What truly bothers me is how some people when they debate the issues, cannot avoid personal attacks.   A select few on both sides, both liberal and conservative, do this. All it really tells me is that the person is void of any actual facts to back their argument, and therefore has to resort to this.  It accomplishes nothing.  Another thing that bothers me, and people on both sides of the issues do thisâ¦ is that some people are so set in where they stand that any new information that may challenge their views is completely ignored. In fact, they only seek out information that supports what they already think. Itâs as if what they think about something defines their very existence.  I prefere to be flexible, and to give myself permission to be wrong at any given time on any given thing.  Now, I do define myself as a liberal, under this definition:  "Left-Liberals generally embrace freedom of choice in personal matters, but support central decision-making in economics. They want the government to help the disadvantaged in the name of fairness. Liberals tend to tolerate social diversity, but work for what they might describe as "economic equality.""  Most of my friends and family are also liberal or Libertarian.  However, there are people I care about who are conservatives.  They have faces and voices that deserve to be seen and heard.  They are good people with valid concerns.  In forming my views, I do take into account the opinions of those who may disagree with me, even if it may offend those that do.  I will defend anyoneâs right to have whatever views that may have, even if they disagree with mine.  My views on the following things, however, are fundamental to me.    And I hope that liberals, conservatives, and those in between would agree with meâ¦  We may point our fingers at our politicians, but we also need to look into the mirrorâ¦  We are  ALL  responsible for protecting our environment.  We are  ALL  responsible for conserving energy.  We are  ALL  responsible, if we are sexually active, for reducing the spread of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases.  We are  ALL  responsible for doing our part in insuring that our most valuable resource,  children ,  grow up safe, educated, healthy and happyâ¦even if we do not have offspring of our own.  We are  ALL  responsible for treating each other with dignity and respect.  Even if we disagree with each otherâs lifestyles, opinions, or beliefs.    If we want others to be more compassionate, we need to start by setting the example ourselves.     I will write in more detail in the future, but for now,  my next three posts will not be political.

      This has come to be my favorite time of year, because itâs when I get to work at the New York Renaissance Faire!!!   Some friends, not involved with the faire, have criticized me for continuing to do the faire, as it does not pay as well as some other acting jobs I would be able to get, if I bothered to try to get them. But, for two days a week it provides enough supplemental income for me, and it makes me incredibly happy be there.   I mean, where else can I get to do all the things I love most in the course of one day?! I perform Shakespeare, do stage combat with the best fighters I know, I work with animals, sing choral music, hear Irish music and bagpipes, entertain children and people of all agesâ¦ the list goes on. All of this on a beautiful landscape of foliage, trees, ponds and wooden bridges. I just pop a Claritin and I'm set! My favorite part is hearing the laughter of children, and then to look to see their toothless smiles looking at me! There is no better feeling than knowing that, though my work, I am making a difference in people's lives. Then, at the end of the day, I get to sit around a campfire and have a beer with some of the most talented and wonderful people I know and am proud to call friends.    This is me at my happiest; regardless of how little the faire is able to pay me. They give more to my soul than any other acting job has. I know that someday I will have to move on, but for now my heart is full of joy and satisfaction.    urlLink New York Renaissance Faire

      I actually celebrated Independence Day last Thursday. My roommate and I had some friends over and watched the fireworks in our neighborhood from our balcony.  It was quite nice.  Yesterday, I worked at the restaurant.  My job is located directly across the street from the WTC/Ground Zero site.  They had a huge ground breaking ceremony to begin rebuilding there, and numerous fireworks displays, so we expected to be quite busy and we were.  I did have an opportunity to speak to a co-workerâs cousin on the phone, who is currently serving in the Navy.  I thanked him for serving and wished him a happy 4th of July.  We talked for quite a while, and when he comes to New York, I will show him the town.  I have been fighting for months now for my restaurant to do something for our military that come and dine or drink.  Some coworkers have complained that they do not tip well.  But I have always objected to their complaints, because if it werenât for these guys who protect our freedoms, we would not be able to come to work and make a living at all.  I told the host, whose son is now in Iraq, to bring all of these guys to my station, as I did not want their tips.  I feel guilty giving them a check at all.  They willingly make the sacrifice, and put their lives on the line to serve our country, and donât get much for it.  The least they deserve is a free beer.  So, yesterday, on the Fourth of July, our District Manager was in the restaurant.  I took the opportunity to calmly say to him, âYou know how we give a 15% discount to our corporate business costumers?  Is there any reason we canât extend that to our Military?â  I was surprised at how quickly he agreed with me.  So, I am proud to have accomplished something on the greatest holiday for the United States of America.  As an Actor, I have had the opportunity to travel this great country.  Iâve been to just about every major city in every state, with the exception of Florida, Alaska, and Hawaii.  So, I know how great this nation is.  Our country is divided on many issues, but we stand united when it comes to supporting our troops.  I have decided to find a more proactive way to do so.    So, I say this a day lateâ¦ Happy Independence Day!   I close with lyrics by Lee Greenwood..    If tomorrow all the things were gone, Iâd worked for all my life. And I had to start again, with just my children and my wife.  Iâd thank my lucky stars, to be livin here today. âCause the flag still stands for freedom, and they canât take that away.  And Iâm proud to be an American, where at least I know Iâm free. And I wont forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.  And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today. âCause there ainât no doubt I love this land, God bless the USA.  From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee. Across the plains of Texas, From sea to shining sea.  From Detroit down to Houston, and New York to L.A. Well there's pride in every American heart, and its time we stand and say.  That Iâm proud to be an American, where at least I know Iâm free. And I wont forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.  And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today. âCause there ainât no doubt I love this land, God bless the USA.  And Iâm proud to be and American, where at least I know Iâm free. And I wont forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.  And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today. âCause there ainât no doubt I love this land,  God bless the USA.

      Today is my Dadâs 60th birthday!  I hope he is having a great day.  My Dad has come an enormous way in the course of his life.  Struggling with Alcoholism for many years, he finally hit a point that made him give up drinking.  He has been sober now for 18 years.  My Dad and I did not really get along very well when I was growing up.  But now,  he has become a wonderful, open minded person. When I realized the fact that he, like me, was a fallible human being,  I was able to cultivate quite a nice relationship with him.  It is unfortunate that his health is not good now, but I believe he has had some time to really enjoy his life, and will for quite a while.  He has much to be proud of.  His example has shown me that no matter what mistakes we make in life, it is never too late to change.  An old dog CAN learn new tricks.  How cool is it to, once youâve grown up yourself, to watch your Dad grow as well?!

      Happy 20th birthday to Johnny Weir!  When I was on tour in 2001-2002, one thing I always looked forward to when getting to my hotel room was turning on the television to watch the figure skating championships.  One competitor that stood out for me was a young skater named Johnny Weir.  He was so young, but a very talented skater, that I found myself rooting for.  I was ready to root for him again as I watched him get ready for the 2003 National Championship.  Unfortunately, Johnny had a stroke of bad luck, sustained an injury, and had to withdraw from the competition.  My heart poured out to him, but I knew he would come back.  Shortly after that time, I found myself extremely lucky to become acquainted with Johnny.   I found him to be an extremely intelligent, funny, open and altruistic person whom I enjoyed talking to.  Then came the 2004 National Championship.  I had to work in the restaurant the day of the long competition, but was somehow able to get the bar to put in on the Television.  Mind you, this is a crowd that would normally have preferred to watch football, but I somehow convinced them to watch my friend compete.  When Johnny skated, the entire place was riveted to the television screen.  Johnny was absolutely amazing.  His scores reflected all the hard work he did during the year, including a perfect 6.0.  He left the arena that day with a gold medal!  Johnny is the prime example for me of the power of perseverance, and believing in yourself.  Yet, he remains humble and extremely interested in other people.  I am truly glad to know him, and hope he has a wonderful birthday today.

      People have been talking a lot about Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, offering many differing opinions.  While I do not think that this film entirely represents the views of all those opposed to Bush, all I have really heard from the pro-Bush camp is non-specific criticism that things are out of context and that it is propaganda.  I have been hoping that someone would offer an intelligent rebuttal, and today I found it in the New York Daily News.  Richard Cohen of the Washington Post, considered to be among the fairest and balanced journalistic resources, writes in his column an argument against the film I pretty much almost entirely agree with.  So, here it is....    New York Daily News - http://www.nydailynews.com  The movie is so bad it could help Bush   Thursday, July 1st, 2004   I brought a notebook with me when I went to see Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" and in the dark made notes before I gave up, defeated by the utter stupidity of the movie. One of my notes says "John Ellis," who is a cousin of President Bush and the fellow who called the election for Fox News that dark and infamous night when the presidency - or so the myth goes - was stolen from Al Gore, delivering the nation to Halliburton, the Carlyle Group and Saudi Arabia and plunging it into war. A better synopsis of the movie, you're not likely to read.  Ellis appears early in the film, which is not only appropriate but inevitable. He is the personification of the Moore method, which combines guilt by association with the stunning revelation of a stunning fact that has already been revealed countless times before.   If, for instance, you did a Lexis-Nexis database search for "John Ellis" and "election," you would be told that "the search has been interrupted because it will return more than 1,000 documents."   The Ellis story is no secret.  I go on about Moore and Ellis because the stunning box office success of "Fahrenheit 9/11" is not, as proclaimed, a sure sign that Bush is on his way out, but instead a warning to the Democrats to keep the loony left at a safe distance.   Speaking just for myself, not only was I dismayed by how prosaic and boring the movie was - nothing new and utterly predictable - but I recoiled from Moore's methodology, if it can be called that.   The case against Bush is too hard and too serious to turn into some sort of joke, as Moore has done. The danger of that is twofold: It can send fence-sitters moving, either out of revulsion or sympathy, the other way, and it leads to an easy and facile dismissal of arguments critical of Bush.  During the Vietnam War, it seemed to me that some people supported Richard Nixon not because they thought he was right but because they loathed the war protesters. Beware history repeating itself.  Moore's depiction of why Bush went to war is so silly and so incomprehensible that it is easily dismissed. As far as I can tell, it is a farrago of conspiracy theories. But nothing is said about multiple UN resolutions violated by Iraq or the depredations of Saddam Hussein.   In fact, prewar Iraq is depicted as some sort of Arab folk festival - lots of happy, smiling, indigenous people. Was there no footage of a Kurdish village that had been gassed? This is obscenity by omission.  The case against Bush need not and should not rest on guilt by association or half-baked conspiracy theories, which collapse at the first double take but reinforce the fervor of those already convinced.   The success of Moore's movie, though, suggests this is happening - a dialogue in which anti-Bush forces talk to themselves and do so in a way that puts off others.   I found that happening to me in the runup to the war, when I spent more time and energy arguing with those who said the war was about oil (no!) or Israel (no!) or something just as silly than I did questioning the stated reasons for invading Iraq - weapons of mass destruction and Saddam's links to Osama Bin Laden. This was stupid of me, but human nature nonetheless.  Some of that old feeling returned while watching Moore's assault on the documentary form. It is so juvenile in its approach, so awful in its journalism, such an inside joke for people who already hate Bush, that I found myself feeling a bit sorry for a President who is depicted mostly as a befuddled dope.   I fear how it will play to the undecided. For them, I recommend "Spider-Man 2."      Thank you, Mr. Cohen  In George W. Bushâs defense, I do not think that public speaking skills are necessarily reflective of oneâs intelligence.  If we are truly serious about removing him from the White House, we need to cool it with the cheap shots and theories and stick to the hard facts.  Trust me, I believe there are enough.

      There are those who may be quite surprised to know this, but I did manage not to remember my best friendâs birthday, which was July 30th.  I hope he accepts my apology.  I have just been so overwhelmed with so many things lately.  I first met Gary back in high school.  We went to different schools, and ended up competing against each other at a regional high school drama festival competition.  He was playing the lead in  Inherit the Wind , I was playing Captain Hook in  Peter Pan .  We both ended up with first and second place.  A couple of years later, I was working as a locker room attendant and lifeguard at the YMCA in Syracuse, where Gary was also a lifeguard, working his way through film school.  I was struggling at âfinding myselfâ, and Gary was a very solid foundation for me, who went above and beyond the call of friendship.  I have been in New York now for about fifteen years.  Gary and I have kept in touch the entire time.   There were times when we did not communicate for very very long periods of time, even as long as a year or two, but when we did talk again, it was always like we had just spoken yesterday.    Not being able to see each other that often can be difficult sometimes, as something is always lost when you only hear a personâs voice without seeing their expressions, but we do get to see each other about once or twice a year and we always have a great time. Still, I very much enjoy talking to Gary on the phone or emailing him, as I very much respect his views on current movies, and events.   We donât always agree on everything, but we always have incredibly intelligent and passionate discussions.  We talk literally for hours without realizing it!  Gary is also really the only person I am able to talk about very personal things with that are going on in my life.  He has been great in helping me keep a healthy perspective on things.  Gary also is one of my examples on the power of perseverance.  He has been working for a few years now on his first feature film,  Attack of the Rat People , which I have seen some raw footage of and look forward to seeing in completion.  Through many daunting obstacles, Gary has fought and stuck it through and is determined to make a fine film.  Hereâs to many more years of knowing  Gary Scott Irons !

      Well, we didnât get quite the same crowds this weekend as we did last at the   urlLink Ren Faire . The reason for this was the weather was a bit iffy.  It actually didnât rain too much, however.  Saturday night, the rain came down quite hard.  I was in my tent, and while I usually like to hear the pitter patter of rain, this was, as Don Kilcoyne put it, âlike being inside a drumâ.  This was all dissipated aftermath of Hurricane Charley, and while it came down pretty hard on us, it was nowhere near what they got in   urlLink Florida .  This was my first time swordfighting on wet grass.  I was a bit nervous about it, but it ended up being the best this fight has gone so far.  I was quite flattered on Saturday when an audience member came up to me after  Much Ado about Nothing , and complimented our show.  She compared our work with productions sheâd seen in  urlLink Utah  and  urlLink Oregon , which are among the top Shakespearean theatres in the United States, and where I hope to one day find work.  On Sunday, there was a wonderful audience member who seemed to infect the entire audience with her joy of the show.  Her laughter and enjoyment gave the rest of the audience permission to react in kind and it turned out to be a really fun show.  Backstage, I said to Kelley McKinnon, âI LOVE that woman!â  It turned out that she is a friend of Kelleyâs, she said to me, âSheâs in   urlLink Avenue Q ", but somehow I heard her say, âYou missed your cue!â  I ran to go onstage, but heard where they were in the scene, and I had plenty of time.  We straightened it all out later!  Iâm ashamed to admit I havenât yet seen that show.  But when I go, I intend on giving her the same energy she gave us!  When things go wrong on stage, I can deal with it, but Iâm never happy about it.  Kelley McKinnon has such a fun spirit that she can turn mishaps into pure audience joy!  Kelley, who plays Beatrice, hides behind a bush while other characters are talking about her, in order to dupe her.  Well, on Sunday, the bush ended up tipping over mid scene and exploding all over the stage.  Kelley simply picked up a single branch and hid behind it while actors and audience alike roared with delight. She was quite proud that she was able to pull herself together for her monologue right after.  I am completely astounded by the success Brian Morvant has achieved in his role of Don Juan, the worldâs greatest lover.  He is so convincing in the role that daily women send him roses, and he has been seen with several hot ladies on his arm at a time.  In fact, when I saw him with three at once, Yorick the Jester decided that he wanted to  be  Don Juan, so they traded hats.  I then walked about in my Jester costume, wearing Don Juanâs hat and three girls on my arm, looking humorously stupid! And Don Juan, just as amusing, with his costume and the Jester hat and homunculus.  This led me to making a character choice.  Yorick the Jester wants to fit in everywhere.   Not only does he want to be in the Robin Hood Band, but he also wants to join every group there is.  On the end of the day Sunday, Yorick was in the Robin Hood Band, a member of the Spanish Court, and the fourth Musketeer.  He did not succeed at being a Singing Wench, but they did dub him as a âSinging Wrenchâ.  I am attempting to get some stuff recorded on dv, so that I can share my faire experiences with friends and family out of town.   I am writing this late because we all went out to see off our director, Lisa Jackson, who is moving to Richmond, Virginia for a couple of years to earn her Masters degree.  I wish her all the best.

        "Good afternoon.   Throughout my life,  I have grappled with my own identity , who I am. As a young child, I often felt ambivalent about myself, in fact, confused.   By virtue of my traditions, and my community, I worked hard to ensure that I was accepted as part of the traditional family of America. I married my first wife, Kari, out of respect and love. And together, we have a wonderful, extraordinary daughter. Kari then chose to return to British Columbia.   I then had the blessing of marrying Dina, whose love and joy for life has been an incredible source of strength for me. And together, we have the most beautiful daughter.   Yet, from my early days in school, until the present day, I acknowledged some feelings, a certain sense that separated me from others. But because of my resolve, and also thinking that I was doing the right thing, I forced what I thought was an acceptable reality onto myself, a reality which is layered and layered with all the, quote, good things, and all the, quote, right things of typical adolescent and adult behavior.   Yet, at my most reflective, maybe even spiritual level, there were points in my life when I began to question what an acceptable reality really meant for me. Were there realities from which I was running?    Which master was I trying to serve?    I do not believe that God tortures any person simply for its own sake. I believe that God enables all things to work for the greater good. And this, the 47th year of my life, is arguably too late to have this discussion. But it is here, and it is now.   At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is.   And so  my truth is that I am a gay American . And I am blessed to live in the greatest nation with the tradition of civil liberties, the greatest tradition of civil liberties in the world, in a country which provides so much to its people.   Yet because of the pain and suffering and anguish that I have caused to my beloved family, my parents, my wife, my friends, I would almost rather have this moment pass.   For this is an intensely personal decision, and not one typically for the public domain. Yet, it cannot and should not pass.   I am also here today because, shamefully,  I engaged in adult consensual affair with another man , which violates my bonds of matrimony. It was wrong. It was foolish. It was inexcusable.   And for this, I ask the forgiveness and the grace of my wife.   She has been extraordinary throughout this ordeal, and I am blessed by virtue of her love and strength.   I realize the fact of this affair and my own sexuality if kept secret leaves me, and most importantly the governor's office, vulnerable to rumors, false allegations and threats of disclosure.   So I am removing these threats by telling you directly about my sexuality.   Let me be clear,  I accept total and full responsibility for my actions.  However, I'm required to do now, to do what is right to correct the consequences of my actions and to be truthful to my loved ones, to my friends and my family and also to myself.   It makes little difference that as governor I am gay. In fact, having the ability to truthfully set forth my identity might have enabled me to be more forthright in fulfilling and discharging my constitutional obligations.   Given the circumstances surrounding the affair and its likely impact upon my family and my ability to govern,  I have decided the right course of action is to resign.    To facilitate a responsible transition, my resignation will be effective on November 15th of this year.   I'm very proud of the things we have accomplished during my administration. And I want to thank humbly the citizens of the state of New Jersey for the privilege to govern.   Thank you."

      I consider myself as one who is Left of Centrist.  I believe that there is plenty of reason to protest any political convention that comes to where I live, including the fact that New York, considered to be at the highest risk for another terrorist attack, is 49th in the country for receiving anti-terror funding.  The blame for this can be evenly distributed among Republican and Democratic politicians.   But the organizers of the protests for the upcoming GOP Convention in New York City, I believe, have gone totally off the deep end.  In fact, when I am asked on the street to sign one of their petitions, I do not hesitate to tell them that I think they are DEAD wrong, literally.  First, the  urlLink New York Civil Liberties Union  has won its battle to prohibit the police from backpack searches of protestors.  While I agree that our government may be playing upon our fears in order to violate our Civil Liberties, I have no objection to having my backpack searched at a public gathering anymore than I would having my luggage x-rayed at the airport.  We may be perhaps too desensitized by the constant  urlLink terror alerts , but we must not forget that there is indeed still a threat.  There are those who would like to see as many of us dead as they can, and will even sacrifice their own lives to insure that they succeed.  This fact is indisputable. While I refuse this to diminish my pursuit and enjoyment of a quality life, to allow large groups of people to gather and protest unchecked is an open invitation for terrorists to bring destruction to our city once again.  The NYCLUâs stance on this is, in my opinion, not only totally idiotic, but also reckless and irresponsible.  Add also the organization, United for Peace and Justice, which is on a never-ending war with the Mayorâs office as to where their protest  urlLink should take place .  After agreeing to protest along the West Side Highway, they are reverting to their original stance that it should take place in Central Park, even threatening a lawsuit.  I say this: anyone can avoid Central Park if they want to avoid protestors.  But conventioneers will be traveling along the highway and a protest as large as this one is bound to interrupt a free flow of traffic. Therefore, I have no doubt the message will be heard.  I think we need to choose our battles better than this.

         urlLink England Brings Back the Court Jester  AFP   Aug. 5, 2004 / An advertisement for the first state jester to be employed in England since 1649 will appear in the Times newspaper on Thursday.   The jester, an outrageously dressed clown complete with triple-pointed hat, is being sought to once again entertain the crowds, as he used to in the royal courts of Europe during the Middle Ages.   English Heritage, a public body responsible for the country's historic environment, is reviving the post which was last seen in the court of King Charles I.   The job will be advertised for the first time in 350 years in the classified section of Thursday's Times.    "Jester wanted. Must be mirthful and prepared to work summer weekends in 2005. Must have own outfit (with bells),"  the advertisement is to say.   Duties of the court jester for King Charles I included providing entertainment at feasts to aid the monarch's digestion and preventing state affairs weighing too heavily on him.   The role was abolished by Oliver Cromwell during his puritanical purge of the country as a fundamentalist Christian republic, there was thought to be no place in England for such frivolity.   English Heritage now wants to bring the jester back and the contemporary counterpart must be willing to feign stupidity and madness for the sake of other's enjoyment, according to English Heritage spokeswoman Tracy Borman.

      My feet are blistered and bruised, my muscles ache all over my body, Iâm bruised in several places, exhausted and sunburned!  And I feel GREAT!!!  Opening weekend at the  urlLink  faire   was a huge success!  We opened to record breaking crowds in perfect weather.  I always feel like Iâm cheating my first audiences, as I know how much room for growth I have, but they really did enjoy themselves.    Some of my favorite moments this past weekend:  The Knighting Ceremony!  As the Jester, I get there early to prepare the little ones for meeting the Queen, and give them ideas to tell her why they should be Knights.  When she arrived, there were about fifty something kids all perfectly rowed bowing before her.  My chessboard fight was a huge success, as was Much Ado about Nothing!  Joey Giambattista, who plays  urlLink Will Scarlet  , and I worked out a fight and then improvised a scene around it before the Final Joust.  The Jester runs up to Will Scarlet and says he wants to be one of  urlLink Robin Hoodâs Merry Men!  Will says that he must be tough and fight with a signature weapon.  The Jester then fights with his homunculus against Will with his daggers, and of course loses and starts crying.  Will feels bad and gives the Jester a hug and says he can be in the band anyway!  They then come upon  urlLink Little John   and do a slow motion replay of the fight they just did.  When they finish, Little John, played by Steve Kraus, says, âAlright, now letâs see it in reverse!â  I looked at him, totally dumbfounded, but we did it!  The audience was completely delighted!  Watching Nick Freeley, at 17 years old, Joust with amazing skill and grace!  Truly awe inspiring!  Well, I am totally exhausted now; my faire day is a real marathon.  Sometimes I am found sprinting from one set to another.  If Iâm not in shape now, I will be by end of summer!       Nick's first joust last year

I am grateful and proud to be among them.  Now that the long and tiring rehearsal process is just about complete, I look forward to letting go and having fun!
