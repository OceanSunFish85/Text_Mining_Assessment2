       Sorry I havenÂ´t been able to post as much, Internet costs a lot more on weekdays... anyway, I will now write about the 24th. I slept tilÂ´ twelve, then ate lunch and dozed around and read a bit. Bed... On the 25th I woke up at nine, did about the same until 6, when we had a 2 hour long and very pleasant barbecue. On the 26th, Steven and I went to the little town of Odenarde. It has a really beautiful town hall with a polar opposite information center. When we got there, we soon discovered that for some reason everything interesting was shut on Mondays. Guess what daythe 26th was.        So we looked at everything from the outside. There were two beautiful Gothic churches, and one incredibly ugly one. Then we visited the adjoining town of Edane (or something like that) which was completely destroyed in the 10th Century by the Count of Wallawalla because he didnÂ´t like itÂ´s mayor or something. So we had fun wandering about the ruins. After that we spent what must have been an hour and a half trying to find a pub (in  Belgium! ). We eventually got ourselves into Brussels, where we finally found our pub...        When we got back we had a quiet supper of delicious cheesey pasta with ham and capers (devoid of children, which was a pleasant change) and played MONOPOLY. I lost. Shit.        Today I went into BrÃ¹gge with Nancy and her friend, who dropped me off in the central square and said weÂ´ll meet you here at 12:30 for lunch. So I wandered around BrÃ¹gge for 2 hours. It was really nice. After lunch (salmon salad) I walked for another 3 hrs, but I slept for about a third of it, so that doesnÂ´t matter.....        ok, at my next destination, which I will be leaving for tomorrow, there is not a computer, so I will not be able to post until August the 11th. I will continue in My Diary. There is a gap of 5 days between the end of my diary (July 13) and the beginning of my blog (July 18)... IÂ´ll fill that in when I get back...   If you want to contact me by post, then please check the comments on this thread... when she sees this, sheÂ´ll put the address up (you will, right Mimi?).     so tata till I get to see all you buggers in Wilmette!

       It is 12:26 a.m. here in Vurste, so I have to write about what I did 1 hr ago as if it were yesterday... but first, let me talk about the day before yesterday... the 22nd. So.. I stayed around Vurste. Read a little, played a little, ate a little, watched a movie, read a little, and slept very little. That having been said, lets get on to today... whoops! yesterday.." everything I said about the day before yesterday, except add on leaving at 7:30 (we were meant to go at 7 but various children kept on injuring themselves) for Gent, which is currently in the middle of a festival. Jeez... I think only "Taste of Chicago" beats that crowd.       It was beautiful.

       On the 21st I woke up early (for me) in the morning and got dressed. I ate a breakfast of bread and Patay, then quickly got in the car while Steven drove me to Brugge. We had absoulutely no trouble finding the place, and when we arrived Ben was playing chess with Lotte and Mia was hitting them over the head with a big fuzzy and incredibly ugly teddy. Ine arrived soon aafter from the loo, and so I greeted her and Uncle David with hugs. Their caravan was very nice and I settled down to a game of chess with Ben while the adults talked. This game didnÂ´t last very long because Lotte brought out her equally ugly teddy and the girls took it in turns to hit us over the head. So we left. We drove quickly to Brugge Central and parked the car, where Uncle David drew a small crowd while unloading his bicycle. Then we set off along a crowded canal towards the center of the city. This took about half an hour because the schlock shops worked their magic on the two younger ones. Ben was fairly resilient... We arrived at an old church and had lunch while we waited for it to open at 1:30. When it did, we went inside and had a look. Turned out that this was the church that housed  Madonna and Child , which I admired and photographed. We then headed down to the canal and tooke a very touristy but quite pleasant boat tour. I sat right next to the "Captain" who looked rather apprehensively at my camera when I got in, but at the end of the trip thanked me profuselyfor only taking only one picture. Poor man must be driven to drink by all the clicking! As soon as we arrived in city center it started to rain, so we decided to climb the belfry, except Ine didnÂ´t want to (towerphobia or whatever itÂ´s called) and Uncle David couldÂ´t, so Mia, Ben and I went up by ourselves. This tower was only 364 steps, but the view was good, so it was fun. By the time we got down it was time to go so we sauntered, then walked, the ran headlong for the station. I managed to leap on to the moving train with a quick goodbye yell to the rest of them. Two stations and half an hour later, I was in Gent!

       Yesterday I went with Steven, Nancy, and Eusebie to the little village  of Ieper, known by the French as Ypres. This is a place that still has 20,000 kilograms of unexploded bombs and grenades in the ground. It was completely destroyed by German bombing raids during WWI (and when I say completely, I mean completely. I have pictures of pictures) and was rebuilt. We took about an hour to drive there and when we got there we parked outside of the tall defensive walls, climbed over and through said walls, and finally came to a massive gate which must have listed at least 500,000 names, all of which had dissapeared and whoÂ´s bodies had never been found. Then we walked through the cathedral, which was beautiful, and then we ate lunch at a place called  Vivaldi  right on the main square. (I had "Penne the Italian way") We then went into the Flanders field museum, which is an interesting if somewhat gruesome museum about all the fighting in Flanders during WWI. They gave us little cards with names of soldiers on them, and throughout the exhibit, we placed the cards in little scanners, 4 in total, and it told us the story in 4 parts. My first guy died. Idiot. The second guy got caught and was incinerated somewhere in Western Germany. Oh well. We then went back to the car and took a quick ride to a part of the land around Ieper where the trenches from WWI were still intact. Now I know why war is hell. they were dark, gloomy, and very, very muddy. Besides, there were bomb craters all around us, and the guide seemed intent on telling us every minute or two how many unexploded bombs there were per square meter in the area around us. We then went back to the seaside (1 hrs. drive) and picked up the boys. We had a drink at a little pub, then went back home to NancyÂ´s. There we put the kids to bed, and Steven and I picked up some fries and sausages at the 5th Frituur we came to (all the rest were shut, as it was 9:30 at night). After dinner we tooke the dog on a walk and played MONOPOLY. I won.

      Today (or as it is, yesterday), I went into Gent with Nancy, Steven, and Eusebie.  It was a lot of fun.  We parked under the same bridge we met Nancy under 2 years ago, walked a short distance to the tram stop, from which we took tram #22 to Vogelmart station, from which we walked a little to a market.  There I spent â¬18.00 on ------- for Liah, â¬5.00 on an --- for Dale, and â¬15.00 on a ------- for Dale.  Then we walked up to the Belfry.  Next to it they were towing cars.  We paid â¬0.50 each to climb up a roundtrip 868 steps to the top of the tallest tower in Gent.  Oh, it was so beautiful....  Then we came down, at a lunch of Lasanga (for me) and walked on... we saw witches, guns, rides, canals, castles, and all manner of other things.  Oh, and I spent â¬15.00 on a ----- for Mimi.  We saw a show for PolÃ¨ PolÃ¨ and saw a really wierd street theater.... I have pictures.  And that was my day.  BTW: Adrian, u lazy bum; why arenÂ´t you commenting or posting?

      Today Mimi, Liah, and I went to the Milwaukee Art Mueseum.  However, the exit we normally use was closed due to construction so we had to manuvere our way around downtown Milwaukee to get there.  Once we got there we had a great time, especially at an exhibit with paintings of the northern woods. We got home about 30 mintes ago.

      Where I sit it is now 6:54 a.m.  That "where" is Hyderabad, India.  From my hotel room it looks like a mostly white-painted, sprawling, low-rise city.  I've been traveling with eleven other people, nine of whom have lost their luggage!  Blame American Airlines for that one...  Last night I hosted eight people for dinner at the hotel's restuarant and all (even those who'd be determinedly living on beer and pretzels for the last two days) seemed to enjoy it.  India makes a very good light beer, called Kingfisher, which might have helped :-)  In trying to send you all a picture I've just discovered that my pictures are all corrupt -- blasted computers!  I think the internal card in the camera is less than right.  We will see...  My plans now are to be up and about, getting people towards a 3 p.m. meeting with the first company we are visiting.  Love to all!

      At 2:00 we left for NancyÂ´s parents house, where I ate a very nice tartÃ©, and read more of the only English book Nancy owns; The Client... they live in a small town owned by a count who demands that all houses be painted a sickly shade of yellow!? That was quite nice, and we stayed there until around 5. Then it started pouring so we lept into the car and drove to the other set of Grandparents, Stevens family... there we quickly saw there ovens (they run a bakery) and picked up Stevens mother. We then drove for about an hour to the coast, where we first took a long and pleasant walk along the seaside, and then ate supper (steak in a mushroom cream sauce) in a mildly fancy restaurant. We then dropped off the boys (thank God) at the apartment Stevens mother owns, which by the way is right on the coast, with a really beautiful view, which includes France and Holland. Then Nancy, Steven, Eusebie and I went for a very long walk, during which we stopped at a pub and got a couple of drinks (hot chocolate for me). Then we drove home. A very nice day.   BTW: If any of you travelers out there wish to post about your days, please feel free to do so.

      Well, I have a pretty busy day booked today... I will be seeing NancyÂ´s parents at 2:00, and Stevens soon after that... we will be leaving the two boys with NancyÂ´s parents, where they will stay for two days, which IÂ´m not all that remorseful about.  We will then leave for the sea.  Oh, and in a couple of days I might ride horses!

      Hello Everyone....  Wow, what a feeling. Here I am sitting at an old PC in Vurste, Belgium, with an AZERTY keyboard, at 10:54 in the evening, and I can communicate with the world.  I will start to spread the word soon with an email.  But for now, letÂ´s see what this looks like...

      Hi Guys!  I am now at Jean DeBleeckeres house, where there is internet connection, so I am able to post.  The first day at Rosa's, the 28th, I didn't do much.  Brit and Yentel came over, and we played a bit, but not much.  The next day, a Thursday, Rosa and I went into Brussels.  We came into Brussels by bus (an hours drive) and then took the Metro to Noord Station.  We first saw the Kings Palace.  Sorry, cameras arent't allowed in there so no pics.  Then we walked down a long hill to the Grote Markt, where we had a drink and watched the world go by.  Then we spent about an hour trying to find Manneken Pis (I don't think Rosa is very good with directions, we must have asked about 50 people where the stupid thing was, and I'm not exaggerating).  When we saw it, we went home.  Friday Lorenz and Thalia came back from their fathers' place.  We all then went over to Brit and Yentels house, where we played in the pool.  I got soaking wet.   Saturday I went to Mechelen with Nancy, Thalia, and Lorenz.  It was a lot of fun.  I bought Order of the Phoenix PB and presents for the pigs.  We saw a church and ate good food.  Fun.  Sunday we lazed around.  Bye for now!!!!!
