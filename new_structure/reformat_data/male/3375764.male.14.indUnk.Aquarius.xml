      In the classroomâ¦  Brandon: Thereâs the new guy! Over there, see?  Feng Shuo: He looks â¦â¦(criticize him rudely)   Brandon: Hey T.J.! See that new guy over there?  Feng Shuo: Ya! Letâs go have some fun with him! Heheâ¦(malicious laughter) (act pally with Nick to show that he is popular)  Nicky: Heâs so shabbily dressed! Heâs an insult to our classâ¦  Feng Shuo, Brandon, and Nicky walk towards Shaunâ¦â¦  Nicky: Hey, new boy, how come youâre so shabbily dressed? You look like a beggar!  Feng Shuo, Brandon, and Nicky insult him for a while.  Shaun tries to protest, but has no choice in the end but to walk away amidst insults.  In a corridorâ¦  Shaun walks around alone.  Feng Shuo and Brandon run past, shoving him aside, and laughing as they run off.  Shaun stares sadly after them.  In the canteenâ¦  Shaun sits at the same table as Feng Shuo and Brandon.  Feng Shuo: Ai! What are YOU doing here?! Thatâs Nickyâs place lahâ¦  Brandon: Yeah, shove off, you! We donât want you here!  Shaun ignores them.  Nicky angrily pulls Shaun off the seat onto the floor. Shaun falls to the ground.  The 3 bullies glare threateningly at Shaun.  Shaun slowly walks away.  Shaun walks around, head bent to show sorrow.  He bumps into Brian.  Brian: Hi! You must be the new guy in our class!  Shaun: Yeahâ¦ ( sign)  Brian: Donât worry about those others. I think theyâre wrong to pick on you like that. Never mind, Iâll be your friend!  Shaun: You will? (amazed, delighted)  Brian: Of course! (sincerely, warmly)  Shaun: (walks with brags)  Brian : whats wrong?  Shaun : Its T.J  Brian: Why you afraid! T.J canât do anything to u, you nose.  like den dun  bully kitchi says: Shaun : He says thingsâ¦  Brian : No one ever got hurt with words. Just ignore him, he can;t do anything to u!  Shaun: (  Looks THOUGHTFUL! )  Brian : I gotta go now, ciao.  ( IN CLASS)  T.J : Look guys, itâs the nerd!  Shaun : Do you have the guts to take me on one on one?  T.J : Hesitates ( Looks scared)  T.J : why should I huh? Get him!   (Two bullies are amazed at the cowardice of T.J, the class starts laughing.)  T.J : SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU, KENNETH!  (Scene switches to Marco and Viks sitting next to each other)  Marco Kind of flirts.  Marco : Will u marry me, my Hero!  Viks : ok.  Shaun comes back from school  Marco (in irritating fashion) : Iâm marrying T.jâs dad! Isnât that good news? T.J will be ur bro!  like den dun  bully kitchi says: Shaun runs away sobbing.  In school, Prowl meets Brian.  Shaun was there.  T.J : Yo Brags  Shaun : (hostile) Go away or ill kill you!   Shaun pushes t.j  Brian looks shocked.  T.J : He always like that one, ignore him.    Shaun slowly takes out a knife.  Shaun stabs nick.  Shaun stabs himself.  They both die.  Nick smiles in death.
