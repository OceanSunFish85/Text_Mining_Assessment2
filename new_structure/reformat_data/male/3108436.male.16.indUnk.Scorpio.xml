       KFC, RAIN, FLOOD, FLOATING SLIPPER AND COCKROACHES.   After school or I should say after the torturing lesson of Ambika, we (HK, Goldsheep, TTP and of course me) went to KFC&gt;Jln Genting Klangâ¦â¦â¦to have our lunch there.  We indulged in pieces of âTOMYAM Chickenâ.  For not a while, EE cames with her friends&gt;&gt;&gt;well, thatâs not so importantâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦        There was a heavy rain outside but I didnât notice it at that time, maybe my concentration was only upon the âTOMYAM Chickenâ in front of me---tillâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦. I heard an astoundment from the thunderstorm.  Then, I only know that there was a heavy rain.  That rain caused a slight flood but it was almost 4 to 5 inches from the ground.  Those pedestrians who wear slippers seems to be a bit silly at that timeâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..I felt a bit guilty to see their slippers floating above the water with my mind scoffing to them â¦â¦ heheheheheâ¦  after the rain gone âmildâ and the wind gone âtameâ a littleâ¦â¦â¦we walked out from KFC toward our bus stop respectivelyâ¦â¦â¦â¦TTP goes with HK while Goldsheep goes with meâ¦â¦.In that time, cockroaches also took a refuge under the roof of that little bus stop â¦â¦. If not I think the flood will drown themâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..

      It has been a shocking dayâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦. My uncle fetches me to school every morning. Today he cames as usual as before &gt; 6 oâclock and a half.  He rushed to my school by right I am not in a hurry.  He droves like drunker or like a worm searching for a hole to burrow itself.  He rushes, rushes and rushes tillâ¦â¦â¦â¦. suddenly there comes a horn&gt;&gt;puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuâ¦â¦â¦â¦.. when I tossed my head to the right, I saw the big front lamp of a massive Four Wheel Drive-âSsang yoong-REXTONâ, several centimeters beside my skull just separated by a thin glass windowâ¦â¦â¦DBH &gt;damn shockingâ¦â¦â¦  Today is also an election day for âStudent Unionâ in my school.  The Headmaster acted like a âDoraemonâ when he is cordially invited to start the opening ceremony.  Then, the last two years AJK of âStudent Unionâ was invited to vote for candidates.  Some of them were so stupid, give a chance for Pn.Lily to condemn our Chong Hwaâs studentsâ¦â¦â¦.they came with their blonde colour-tinted hair.  When I reach home, my maid cooked me a big bow of  âBi hun soupâ andâ¦â¦..my tongue âdetectedâ foreign objects again---sand.  !@#$%^*()_+ _)(*^%$#@!â¦â¦â¦.!!

       âCountingâ on my maid   I think I have a terror of eating my maidâs foodâ¦â¦..or even eating in my house.  I ate a lot despite her badly cooking, but she act too muchâ¦â¦â¦ till Iâm going to become dejected to put her food into my stomach.  She often âadornâ my dinner or lunch with foreign objects like plastic andâ¦â¦â¦â¦.I still remember that last month when I found two small stones shape like bubbles inside my bottle.  I almost swallowed itâ¦â¦â¦â¦.dunno what will happen to me if I didnât spit it out immediately.  Besides that, she often grinds at nightâ¦â¦..no, I shall say midnight&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that noise(maybe is a lullaby) disturbs me to deep into slumber.    One thing I can say is&gt;she was keen on washing toiletâ¦â¦â¦â¦..1 hour everyday in toilet doing washing jobs but the toilet still not seems to be very cleanâ¦â¦â¦.....

      Fever is not an illness:  It is simply a raised body temperature,and usually a sign of some form of infection.  But what should you do about it???   "Is it important to keep warm when you have a temperature?" You should not allow yourself to get too cold.  On the other hand, there is no need to pile blankets on the bed or heat the room to oven temperature.  Rest, be as comfortable as tou can, and your body will do what is needed.    "When I have temperature, I shiver one minute and sweat profusely the next.  Why is this?" In a fever, the temperature not only goes up, it swings up and down much more than usual.  As it is on its way up, people experience shivering chills, which may be so intense as to cause uncontrollable shaking attacks, called rigors.  As soon as the temperature starts to fall again, there is a lot of sweating.

       I ate a lot todayâ¦â¦â¦.  During recess time was a hotdog burger, after school was the irresistible TOMYAM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yummmmmmmâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦... that was extremely delicious till I canât control my self.  While Iâm eating, I sweat ceaselessly and I enjoy thrill although Iâm not riding on a roller-coaster or space-shot.  Actually, I have had asked TTP to go and eat with me but luckily he denied to go&gt;&gt;&gt;If not, I think the restaurant have to confront a flood by his SWEATâ¦â¦â¦hjehehe, just kiddingâ¦.. hope he wonât be annoyed.  1 hour later after the TOMYAM, I went home and devoured my lunch again&gt;&gt; this time was 'MI HUN KUIH'â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦&gt;&gt;oops! My mother just said to me she had bought a âba kua pauâ for me.  HEHEâ¦â¦ I have to feed my mouth again.

        A Blondeâs Brain At Work     A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead all work at the same office for a female boss who always goes home early.  "Hey, girls," says the brunette, "let's go home early tomorrow. She'll never know."  So the next day, they all leave right after the boss does. The brunette gets some extra gardening done, the redhead goes to a bar, and the blonde goes home to find her husband having sex with the female boss! She quietly sneaks out of the house and returns at her normal time.  "That was fun," says the brunette. "We should do it again sometime."  "No way," says the blonde. "I almost got caught."   Hahahahahahahahaâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦&gt;&gt;&gt;â¦â¦&gt;&gt;&gt;just kidding!!!       Today was a boring day.  Went to school but nothing to do.  By the way, today only got two teachers attended class--add maths teacher and  ??teacher.. Iâm only concentrating during Add Maths period.  The ??teacher, Pn.??â¦â¦..was silly today&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered people to stand up and answer her stupid questions. Not only today, previously she was already like that. I HATE HER&gt;&gt;how about youâ¦â¦.?

Because of that âcrazyâ, today I got nodded, nodded and nodded all the time&gt;&gt;&gt;not enough sleepâ¦.ahhhhhhhhâzzzh   Ah!! Lets see the poem written by Robert Louis Stevenson  &gt;&gt;&gt;dunno whether spell correct or not&gt;&gt;hjeheheâ¦â¦..â¦.          THE LAND OF NOD               From breakfast on through all the day                 At home among my friends I stay,                          But every night I go abroad                       Afar into the land of Nod.                              All by myself I have to go,                        With none to tell me what to do---                               All alone beside the streams                           And up the mountain-sides of dreams.                       The strangest things are there for me,                        Both things to eat and things to see,                        And many frightening sights abroad                       Till morning in the land of Nod.               Try as I like to find the way,                   I never can get back by day,               Nor can remember plain and clear                    The curious music that I hear.    Ahhhhhhhhhhhhâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..zzzzzzhh!@#$%^*()_+still got plenty of damn bloody homeworks to doâ¦â¦..

       A Horoscope For The Workplace     ASTROLOGY: tells us about you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy, and what you watch on TV. Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out...  MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales.   SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree," you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with "customers" so you can "concentrate on the big picture." You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life.   TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are  instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth.   ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest "ergodynamic" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your "carpal tunnel"...   ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the  majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.   HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut,  have lunch, and mail a letter!   MIDDLE MANAGEMENT/DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT/"TEAM LEADS": Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Middle Managers," as everyone in your social circle is a "Middle Manager."   SENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Senior Managers," as everyone in your social circle is a "Senior Manager."   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play "Customer Service." Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your boss.

       JOKES   New Rules For Employment    SICKNESS AND RELATED LEAVE: We will no longer accept a doctor statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.   SURGERY: Operations are now banned. As long as you are an employee here, you need all your organs. You should not consider removing anything. We hired you intact. To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment.   BEREAVEMENT LEAVE: This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead friends, Relatives or coworkers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases, where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early, provided your share of the work is done enough.   YOUR OWN DEATH: This will be accepted as an excuse. However, we require at least two weeks notice as it is your duty to train your own replacement.   RESTROOM USE: Entirely too much time is being spent in the restroom. In the future, we will follow the practice of going in alphabetical order. For instance, all employees whose names begin with ''''''''''''''''A'''''''''''''''' will go from 8:00 to 8:10, employees whose names begin with ''''''''''''''''B'''''''''''''''' will go from 8:10 to 8:20 and so on. If you''''''''''''''''re unable to go at your allotted time, it will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn comes again. In extreme emergencies employees may swap their time with a coworker. Both employees'''''''''''''''' supervisors in writing must approve this exchange. In addition, there is now a strict 3-minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, and the stall door will open.   PAYCHECK GUIDE: The following helpful guide has been prepared to help our employees better understand their paychecks:   Item Amount Gross pay $1,222.02 Income tax $244.40 Outgo tax $45.21 State tax $11.61 Interstate tax $61.10 County tax $6.11 City tax $12.22 Rural tax $4.44 Back tax $1.11 Front tax $1.16 Side tax $1.61 Up tax $1.08 Down tax $1.14 Tic-Tacs $1.98 Thumbtacks $3.93 Carpet tacks $0.98 Stadium tax $0.69 Flat tax $8.32 Surtax $2.23 Ma''''''''''''''''am tax $1.23 Corporate tax $2.60 Parking fee $5.00 F.I.C.A. $81.88 T.G.I.F.

I think all this was stupid view points from someone, it may be something happen to him &gt;&gt;may be someone has had offended him .  Hope tomorrow he will be okey.........

We were not very adapted to the new exam formatâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦especially the exam format for BIO, FIZIK and KIMIA, this was because we only have to suffer for one paper for these subjects previouslyâ¦â¦â¦.and now got three papersâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.think about it also want to vomitâ¦.â¦â¦.got phobia alreadyâ¦â¦â¦.&gt;&gt;&gt;someone can help me to check for the scientific name of the âexam phobiaâ?? However, the torturing exam is overâ¦â¦â¦..as TTP says&gt;&gt;MERDEKA Nevertheless, I just hope to enjoy my time during these holidays.  Hahahaâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.impossible to believeâ¦ I âabandonedâ my KIMIA reference book out site my classâ¦â¦â¦â¦just outside the corridorâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦That night, I have had worried for it but because of tiredness I went fainted(sleep).  Fortunately, LMF picked it up and kept it in her lockerâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.they think that huge and heavy book is belong to Venessaâ¦â¦â¦.because inside that got TTPâs notes and he recognized itâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..so LMF helped to keep itâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦luckily I borrowed the notes from Venessa.  If not, no person knows whose book is this and they will just left itâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.then my book which cost RM24.95 will = cool over water = like the Cantonese saysâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. How careless am Iâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.  I really want to thank LMFâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.thank you very much!!!  Huh!@@###$@#!@%#^#$ That NAZRI was so stupidâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦fell from the chairâ¦â¦â¦..hahahahaâ¦â¦hehehehe!@#$$^_^     Hahaâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦first time taking a METROBUS to my destination  Donât know what had happened to JJâ¦. when I ask him the bus fees, he says to me this is a bus and he teaches me how to spell âB.U.Sâ â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦really stupid! Then, there was a fubsy womanâ¦â¦.the bus conducterâ¦â¦â¦â¦.the bus is already overweight and still wants to take more passengersâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..and she constantly shoutingâBELAKANG SIKIT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.BELAKANG SIKITâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦so annoyingâ¦â¦â¦.then the pineapple muttered â¦â¦â¦â¦.âif you leave the bus then the bus can accommodate more passengersââ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..hahahaha that was really funnyâ¦â¦â¦â¦..

      Really don't understand.............this is not the first time.......................those Indonesian.....I think so...that is not natural disaster...It is man-made disaster.........       look!!! what a thick haze...... just from forest fire in INDONESIA   (I emphasized that this is not the first time)  A number of island nations in the eastern Indian Ocean were shrouded in thick haze produced by a large number of fires burning in Malaysia and Indonesia. Hundreds more fires were being set even as the thick cloud of smoke already severely reduced visibility across the region. Officials warned that the level of pollution was getting dangerously high and unhealthy. The fires are being set primarily by plantation owners, taking advantage of the current dry season, to clear forested lands and to burn away the surface peat in swamp areas.

      Just watched âHarry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkabanââ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦in KLCC.By right, I will be more pleasure if I enjoy this trip with my friends or with my parentsâ¦â¦â¦ This trip is sponsored by Citibank and we have the coupon to redeem TGV popcorn and Coca-colaâ¦.my dear uncle decided to bring my younger brother and sister to enjoy these benefitsâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦andâ¦â¦â¦..I have to go to take good care of my brother and sisterâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ However, maybe someone else can ask me to join their trip to watch âThe Day After Tomorrowââ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.or I hope fervently that my parents can watch this movie with meâ¦â¦â¦â¦..  Lets say the Harry Potterâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.there is nothing so interesting â¦is a bit of comedy and I think the fighting between weird creatures caught my full concentrationâ¦â¦â¦â¦.Guess what ???the professor of Hogward School can transform to an awful creature.  Harryâs Godfather (Sirius Black), also a fugitive from Azkaban but he is innocentâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦can transform to a â¦â¦..donât know how to sayâ¦.err â¦â¦a Dogâ¦called Grim?????/forgot already whether is a dog or is a wolfâ¦.the shape is there lahâ¦â¦â¦.

She doesnât know how to draw the solenoid correctlyâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦. When I ask her about the electric motorâ¦â¦â¦â¦.She answered me nothing????  Lets see the below conversation:    Bug: CIKGU!! Saya tak faham ini oh! Giraffe: Mana! TENGOK! Bug: NEH! Ini lohâ¦â¦..(showing the book to her) Giraffe:â¦â¦â¦â¦..(Canât even utter a wordâ¦Just like her mouth clogged by s**t) Giraffe: Neh !!

      Just came back from a visit to IMR(Institute Medical Research) and FRIM(???) organized by the Mathematics Society.   Firstly, we went to IMR and we saw a lot of plants for the use of medical purpose or herbs as well.  When we reach the herbs gardenâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..the first thing we have done was searching for Kacek Fatimah and Tongkat Ali.  Of course, we have had asked for the ways to consume itâ¦â¦â¦..For Tongkat Ali, we just have to boil its root in water and drink it.  The attendant emphasized that one cannot simply consume its powder due to humanâs kidney cannot filter those tiny substances.  Then, before we left the garden the attendant gave Miss Phoon an Madam Chan three pieces of  âSambung Nyawaâ for its use of lower the blood pressure and ease migraine.  Miss Phoon and Madam Chan seems to be very curious to those herbs as I saw them discussing and talking about how their grandmother use herbs to ease the illness all along the wayâ¦â¦â¦â¦And they said they wants to get it planted at home for their parentâs sake.  Since the plant is so good at lower the blood pressureâ¦â¦â¦â¦..we devoured it without washing itâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME TO EAT LEAFâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦Impossible to imagine.   At the museum, we have saw well-preserved rats, squirrel, birds, cats, baby tiger, and snakesâ¦.There are various types of snakes with weird namesâ¦â¦â¦I can remember a one, it is âUlar Kucing Bergigi Anjingââ¦â¦..really cannot imagine why those people is so creative as they created this name for this type of snakesâ¦â¦â¦â¦.. After this, we went for jungle tracking at FRIM.  We can see Miss Phoonâs bag can accommodate lots of things although it is smallâ¦â¦â¦â¦..just like Doraemonâs magic bag.  We saw a lot of giant trees such as Cengal(the hardest tree), Meranti, Kapur,..â¦â¦..Besides giant trees we saw giant antsâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦the guide has had played with the approximately 3 centimeters long giant worker antsâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦Think of why was he acted so braveâ¦â¦â¦..this was because that is just a worker ant and not a soldier antâ¦â¦â¦.If so, then he will sure die in piecesâ¦â¦â¦  We have had climbed up to 1000 feets of height â¦â¦â¦â¦..Almost deadâ¦â¦â¦TTP and I have to beware of stepping into âshitsâ(mud) along the route.  We also saw the IKAN NAGA with its broad-wide mouthâ¦â¦almost 15+ centimeters wideâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.and its long is approximately three of the length of our school deskâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.We bought a long piece of bread to feed the IKAN NAGAâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.All of us have done it but only TTP.  He has had fed himself with the âROTIâ(please keep your hair up TTP).  Along the journeyâ¦â¦â¦â¦..I really cannot stand of the attitude of DS.

And my voice box is not covered by lipidsâ¦â¦â¦â¦so I canât groan like a sow.(in Chinese is MU CHU). Miss Lee also came in to our classâ¦â¦â¦..to substitute the âGiraffeâ âs classâ¦â¦.She had a lot to talkâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.CEASELESSâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.very noisyâ¦â¦â¦â¦just wanna choke herâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦CYS is the most innocent during that momentâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ After school, I went to 7eleven to buy Chunky Kit-Kats. The guy at the counter is madâ¦.just like his grandmother gives birthâ¦â¦he talks a lot to me.  Well, Iâm not very patient to listen to all his bullshits â¦..just wanna leave quickly because W12 is coming soon.  Next time when I see him in the shop, I will not step inâ¦â¦â¦â¦..if not he got a lot to talk toâ¦â¦â¦â¦.  BUG BUG BUG BUG BUG!!! Just wanna shout like a bugâ¦â¦.OH! BUGGINâ YOU!!!

      I did a stupid thing todayâ¦â¦â¦â¦..It rained heavily from the time approximately 1.30 p.m. to *.**p.mâ¦â¦â¦â¦and we (HF,MF,SHY)  have our BM tuition at 1.45p.m. at TYâs houseâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦Feel like lucky because both HF got their own umbrella (MRMY do not have a one)â¦so that HF share an umbrella and MRMY share a oneâ¦â¦â¦..Along the journey to TYâs house, SHY is the one who holds the umbrellaâ¦â¦â¦.just like the umbrella is for his own.  He left only a few inches for me to refugeâ¦â¦â¦â¦..Although I know Iâm not big-size but how CRUEL is heâ¦â¦â¦And also there is a lot of lower paces(holes) that filled with the rain waterâ¦â¦and I just step into itâ¦â¦â¦..not saying that Iâm senseless but it is because Iâm busying fighting for my right to have the half side of the little umbrellaâ¦â¦. One funny thing isâ¦â¦.if you are one who walks beside HFâ¦â¦you can hear screaming sound (AAAAAA!!!) comes out from her voice box.  Once a lorry or a motorcycle or a car as well cross throughâ¦â¦â¦.keep screaming AAA! AAA! AAA!   Hahahaha When I reached TYâs house Iâm totally wetâ¦â¦â¦.when I turn back my shoesâ¦.I saw water dripping outâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦it was the same while I squeeze my stockingâ¦â¦â¦â¦HF screamed frequently while NAZRI talking some *** stuffâ¦â¦.LIKE squirrelâ¦â¦â¦..  ONE thing weird is FSJ kept his stocking in his pocketâ¦.with the reason--- It will make the stocking to dryâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..TRY to thinkâ¦â¦is it logicâ¦..

      WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD !!! Don't know why I am having this feelings........ I found that my house is a bit of noisy ...not a good place for me to study in peace....this may due to the conflict arose within my parents and my eldest sister.....she just got her scholarship to pursue for chemical engineering but...she is reluctant to go...and also hatred to go....I can see this from her emotion and temper......she said she wants to continue her FORM 6 and she said she prefer bio compare to others....she wants her career to be relevant to BIO stuff.....but my parents disagreed that.....then sometime there are some intense quarrel......

      Today is my first day to enter the crowdâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.To enter the distinguish KASTURI tuition center.  Well, every thing is just nice but just a little bit problems dealing with the enrolment procedures.  I hate the little fubsy MALAY woman who sat like a bitch or somehow like a sow at the registering counter.  Want to die then go !!!  After P.Hong class, I went home by taking a LRT ride.  Damn, people were as much as mountains.  When the door of the LRT cubicle open, people who wants to leave pushing those who wants to enter the cubicle.  Luckily, I have had hold something. If not, they will push me out.  At that moment, no one is going to tolerate with you!!

      I really bewildered by somethingâ¦â¦.I have known somethingâ¦â¦.something that is bad â¦â¦â¦something that I do not know how to sayâ¦..or you want to say , it was totally lewdâ¦â¦â¦..The one I adore, but he has done something which the whole of my family cannot imagineâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..I knew this after my parent told meâ¦. Really, â¦â¦..and I have had to pretend as I donât know everythingâ¦â¦â¦â¦..still have to show my happy face to him, still have to take his car to schoolâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..He has done something , something that is extremely cheapâ¦â¦â¦makes dirty my house â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. But I wonder why I still have to pretendâ¦â¦â¦..to give my respect to himâ¦â¦â¦ Damn! My bloody lewd uncle......He deserves a poke!@!
