       yes, nay got a puppy.    let me clarify, ur.. cleaner's dog had puppies and one of them really liked it @ ur place so decided to stay there? *looks hopeful*       with the whole "year 10s moving up", i agree with mark [for once] and i think u guys should move up cos of all of the above points. "what she said" [the 'she' refers 2 our lil dorkus here]      umm.. and yeh, i don't think i'm going to the prayer rally either..      i think that's it. so.. yep, u guys have fun @ the prayer rally      cyas, dot ^_^      p.s. danie still owes me a shiny yellow star from the first sleepova :D

      SLEEP is good for you. you should SLEEP more. i'm SLEEPy just talking about SLEEP *yawns and nods dreamily*  sorry guys, i won't be at the prayer thing tomorrow night - von and dot, you'll probably have to organise your own transport there, since i dont think my sis is coming either.  mark, Parkes is in the middle of a sheep pen, and i had the pleasure of going there. haven't u seen The Dish before?! [well, actually, i havent either, but ssshhh]  puppy, nay?
