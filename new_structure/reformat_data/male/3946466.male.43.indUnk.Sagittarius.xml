      Ford A. Vogel  Art Business Practices-Friday  July 28, 2004    Preliminary Prospectus     As a self promotional project, I am proposing the painting upon the flat roof of the United Methodist church that is located next to the Art Institute of Washington. The painting would be of a theological nature and depict the hand of God reaching out to touch the hand of man. The style of the image would be pointillism and would become visible as a complete image from the neighboring buildings as well as passing aircraft. The image would be applied with external latex paint and rollers.    Although this promotional project does not directly address my web design abilities, it does exemplify my ability to organize, design, and promote a project that is of benefit to the church, and the school, as well as me. The project is large enough to attract a great deal of publicity, well located on commercial flight routes, and situated very near a major television station. The subject of the design is of a publicly acceptable nature that reflects well both upon the church and the Art Institute. Hopefully it will speak well of me as an artist as well.   Submitted for your consideration,      Ford A. Vogel

        With his makeshift wings spread above him, Basil spiraled upward on a rising updraft. The warm currents of air lifting from the cliffs below filled the taught membranes of his glider. They carried him further and further from the ground beneath him. His mind was somewhere else, somewhere long, long ago.   âMother! Mother!â Llywiln cried, âWhy canât I fly?â Glymich had been preparing herself for the inevitable questions that she was sure would arise. Ever since her âLittle Pink Ballâ had taken to speaking, she had practiced responses to âWhy am I different? Why donât I have claws? Why arenât my teeth pointed?â Somehow the thought of flight had slipped by, it had just never occurred to her. As naturally as dragons took wings and flight for granted, she had just naturally assumed that her tiny Llywiln would take his lack of wings and flight for granted.   That was when Glymich first realized;   He thinks that he is one of us!   As she crouched there thinking of a response, her resolve formed. If her precious Llywiln thought of himself as a dragon, why shouldnât he be treated as one, including all of the privileges that came with being a member of the most ancient of races. As much as she hated putting him off, the insistent, âWhy? Why? Why?â not being the only reason; Glymich told him, âWeâll speak of it later.â   That evening, she cautiously approached Moodrake. He was the largest, and the strongest of the males in Wyre Clatnech. Even had he not been quite so big, or quite so powerful, Glymich would have had misgivings about this impending âmeywarâ or meeting of the minds. Moodrake was logical, contemplative, and wise beyond his years, but when it came to humans, he was ruled by his emotions. The most prominent of which being, that he hated all things human.   In the darkness, Glymich let her mind reach out toward that strength that was their leader. This was an ability that every dragon possessed; they all had the ability to share their thoughts with one another. It was also a talent that she would never speak of to her precious Llywiln. Knowing that he would never attain the ability to do that, it seemed cruel to even tell him of it. Gently, ever so gently, Glymich nudged at the fortress that was Moodrakeâs mind.   The rumbling,   âYes, Glymich, what do you want?â   which tore through her mind, was none-the-less gentle, by Moodrakeâs standards. She sighed an inward sigh of relief; at least she had caught him in a good mood. Glymich knew that above all else, she must keep her feelings for Llywiln to the back of her mind. If he found out about her affection for the human, Moodrake would never agree.   âIs this about that pet human of yours?â   rumbled through her mind. Had he guessed? No. Quickly, she replied,   âYes, my lord, I was just thinking that maybe we should teach him to fly.â   Glymich braced herself for the explosion of rage that she knew would overwhelm her mind at any moment. She could hardly believe it when her head was filled with the deep, echoing laughter that only a dragon could make.     âAngry, why should I be angry?â   he went on. So he could probe her deepest thoughts, she would have to be more careful.   âBut Moodrake,â   she responded,   âhe is human, the skies are the domain of the dragons!â   Somehow, it seemed to Glymich, that she had turned out to be more appalled than Moodrake!   âNonsense,â   he continued,   âdo not the birds, and the lowly insects fly as well?â     'Besides,'   he added,   âTeaching him to fly, and him succeeding are two different things. He is just as likely to end up dropping from the sky like a fire rock, leaving only a crater to mark his passing. Then there would just be one less human for us to worry about!â       So that was his game,   Glymich thought to herself;   he thinks that itâs impossible for Llywiln to fly. He plans to let the problem take care of itself.   She would show him, they both would show him just what her little man-drake could do!   When Glymich had presented him with his first glider, fashioned from saplings and shed dragon skins, Llywiln had never been happier, or more excited. When he took to the glider, as naturally as if he had been born with wings, she had never been so proud. When Moodrake found out that the pesky human hadnât been crushed upon the rocks below, he was never angrier. For weeks, one could see bursts of steam billowing from his cave. It was then, that Llywiln realized; he would have to be very careful around Moodrake.   Basil slipped out of his nostalgic reveries to discover that he had slipped from the rising updraft, and was well on his way along a downward spiral. If he wasnât careful, the old drake might have gotten his wish yet, even if he wasnât around to enjoy it. Oddly, Basil missed the cranky old drake. With very little altitude in which to maneuver and the carpet of green treetops was closing quickly. Basil turned sharply towards the south and picked out a small rocky overlook above the Chloridian Forest on which to land. In his distracted state, he had swiftly strayed northward, half the length of the Great Baaleth Range, to the uppermost realms of his mountain home.              Chance hadnât felt the crate hit him. Then again, he couldnât feel anything. His first thought, of course, was that Aquar had claimed him. That was of course, the fitting fate of all good sea captains. He was well prepared to spend eternity in Aquarâs realm. After all, in life the sea had been his home, and it had been good to him. Why then, should he not spend the afterlife serving it?   Just as he was resolving himself to his new occupation, an eternal one, a strange scent assailed his senses. It was the scent of smoke, and of cooking that he smelled. He could swear that he heard a sizzling sound. Odd, without body or form he wouldnât think that he could sense anything. Then the reality of it began to dawn on him. Even if he was bodiless, a spirit trapped within the sea. Even if his spirit could sense things around him, there would be no fire! Somehow, he must still be alive, very puzzled, but alive.   It was then that he heard a crystalline voice, the voice of a siren, or of an angel. Ever so softly it whispered to him, âClose your eyes, this may be bright.â His head still ringing with that sweet voice, Chance clenched his eyes as he felt something soft, gently pulled back across his face. As he felt the orange warmth of the sun envelop his face, he was sure that he was still alive. He wasnât sure why he was alive, but he was sure that he was.   âWe tied you down,â the voice continued, âso the wind and waves wouldnât wash you away. Later, when the storm had cleared, we covered you to protect you from the sun. How do you feel?â How did he feel? At the sound of the question, Chance almost laughed, âfeelâ he couldnât feel a thing! He was however, alive. Based on his assumption of a few moments ago; that was a lot better than he had expected. With a genuine smile, he replied, âIâll live!â Beyond that, Chance wasnât too certain as to what he could look forward to.   Slowly, he let his eyes squint open. Above him he saw clear skies, marred by only the lightest of fluffy cumulus clouds, and above him, a dark rounded object that came slowly into focus. As if rewarding him for opening his eyes, he beheld the sweetest face that he had ever seen. With its deep ebon hair, parted by a stripe of white that ran from front to back, sparkling green eyes, and refined thin lips that now opened into an angelic smile, Chance found that he now had a reason to look forward once more. The metallic bronze of her skin seemed to shimmer in the sun, right down to the points of her ears. Pointsâ¦ this had to be the elwess that he had seen on that strange craft!   How could they have survived the storm?   Echoed through his head. Others, of course, replaced these thoughts, as he found himself lost once more within those eyes, and that smile.             Trylla had never seen a human male before, at least not up this close. They were funny, awkward looking things. They seemed big and clumsy; how did they manage to stay upright? No doubt, their bulky frames held more sheer muscle than an elwan, but they lacked the coordination to use it. Their skin was an odd pinkish tan as well, not a proper metallic shade as hersâ¦ and what was with those ears? Trylla had to fight to keep from laughing out loud every time she saw them. After all, everyone knew that the more pointed oneâs ears, the higher their intelligence. No wonder the poor dullard fell overboard.   Despite all of that, there was something about this big, awkward human that Trylla found strangely exciting. Not in the âforbidden foodâ sort of way, but more of the âsimply something of a different natureâ sort of way. There was something about him that pulled at the âNanjarâ in her soul. True, he was funny looking, with his wild red-orange hair and that strange growth of it around his mouth and chin; elwan never grow facial hair. His size also was beyond anything that she had imagined humans to possess. He was a good one and one half times larger than her, with muscular arms and legs. This one was no artist or poet. This was a being that was used to hard work. A soul that had known sorrow, and loss, but still he smiled. What a smile!  It was then, that Trylla knew that she must get to know more of this âhumanâ. She resolved herself to experience his being, no matter how strange, at first he may seem.   As she looked up from her administrations to their helpless passenger, she caught a look from Dunkirk out of the corner of her eye. It was not an approving look. In fact, it was a look of downright disapproval. Oh well, not to worry, Dunkirk disapproved of most of the things that Trylla did. He could be so old fashioned!   Still, he was her friend; he did seem to care what happened to her. Sometimes, his advice even proved useful, when she listened to it. The âhumanâ couldnât move now anyway, so she would humor Dunkirk. After all, when you find yourself alone on a boat in the middle of the sea, and a long way from anyone, or anything else, why upset the one other person on boardâ¦ But now, they werenât alone!           Dunkirk kept himself busy with the boat, the nets, and the hundred other little jobs that his tiny hands were so good at. Being the only crew on this miserable journey was a thankless job. On the other hand, the better he cared for the boat, the better his chances of seeing land once again. The greater the care that he took of the nets, the fuller his belly would be, if he could only keep it down.   He had tried to dissuade Trylla from her latest folly, even suggested that they leave him in the sea. She wouldnât hear of it. Once she pointed out that it could just as easily have been him that had been floating there. There was little more that he could have added after that, except that he had wished that it were. He did not wish the human any true harm; he didnât know this man well enough to feel about him one way or another. What he had learned of humans though, was enough to make him feel much safer knowing that he couldnât move. Dunkirk had tried to get some of this across to Trylla through subtle hints, but he knew better than to say anything outright. He knew all too well that once she had set her mind to something, there was very little that could dissuade her, especially, if it was something that she wanted.   That of course, wasnât going to keep him from letting her know exactly how he felt about it. The look that she gave back to his made it clear, that she understood. It didnât stop her, but she understood.            Blossom had finished sweeping out the floor of the inn. She was just about to sweep the debris out the door with her thresh broom when she noticed a small package wrapped in leaves. It was sitting on the old stump by the front door. As she quickly looked up, she thought that she had caught a glimpse of a figure in heavy robes, ducking into the shadows of the woods. As she cautiously approached the small parcel, Blossom noticed that it sat upon a small scrap of parchment, on which was scrawled in a simple sloppy hand,  âFOR TINEYâ . Rather than touch it herself, she ran into the inn to tell Tiney of her discovery.               âA package you say?â Tiney mumbled looking up from the already spotless bar that he was polishing again. âLet me see!â he grumbled, as he stepped away from his work. The last thing that he wanted to do was to waste time on foolishness, but he had to admit, that he had never received a package in his entire life. Sure enough, as he came out of the door, it sat there just as Blossom had said. Blossom had also told him of the shadowy figure that she thought that she had seen. He stood there eyeing the package suspiciously as his fingers ran lightly over the cut across his cheek. At first, it had seemed remarkably painful for such a light abrasion. Now, it almost seemed numb, and that was starting to concern him. It could be infected, or worse. With no healers in the area, this light wound could do some serious damage. Try as he might to push it to the back of his mind, the thought kept surfacing,   âWhat if it was poisoned?â   It was truly the most despicable of deeds, but there were assassins known to use poisoned weapons.   With his attention once more on the parcel, he reached for the stick by the door. A tool that he often used to chase off the marcots when they came out of the woods scavenging or looking for handouts from him or his patrons. He often found it had other uses. Giving the small item a shove with the staff, Tiney was satisfied that it wasnât malevolent in nature. Being so assured, he turned his attention to the roughly scribed note.   The outside of the parchment held little more information than his name. Upon lifting it open, he discovered more of that same simple script, saying,  âsorry, this for cut.â  and was signed,  âkretookâ . Tiney recognized the name, not individually, but enough to know that it was a trog name. Suddenly, he understood the nature of his wound. He looked down at the package, realizing that it must be a cure for the poisonous secretions that trogs are rumored to ooze from their skins. âIâll be the son of a seventh uncle!â Tiney muttered under his breath. âHuh?â questioned Blossom; she obviously was lost by all of this. Tiney carefully unwrapped the long shalla leaves that enclosed it and found a small freshwater clamshell. Opening the shell, he found a small stick, and a sticky substance that seemed to be made from roughly crushed fungus, clam, and something sort of talc or clay-like. The mixture itself seemed to slightly shimmer.   Tiney was a little hesitant at first, but finally concluded that there was no reason that anyone would try to poison him twice. Using the small applicator, he dabbed the shimmering substance along his damaged cheek. Almost at once, the numbness was replaced by a strong but pleasant tingling. He would have noticed that the tingling was subsiding if he hadnât been distracted by the shocked look of amazement on Blossomâs face as she stepped back and choked out âH-h-how?â Taking a bucket of water from the well, and gazing at its mirrored surface, he did a double take as well. The deep, oozing cut was gone, replaced by smooth, unblemished skin.   The miraculous nature of this compound would have amazed him even more if his thoughts hadnât jumped ahead to something even more astounding. He suddenly realized that he recognized this particular type of shellfish from experience with passing traders. This type couldnât be found within half a days ride, and who knew where the other parts of the mixture had come from. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to make up for what seemed was an accidental wound. Tiney would have to remember to make a point of expressing his thanks to that someone, if he ever saw him again.           Kretook had felt bad, not just because he was afraid to return to the Elw Inn. He truly regretted having hurt the innkeeper. He had been hurt before, himself. Not always physically, but he knew better than most, the feel of true suffering. The men that he had been fighting would get what they deserved, but the innkeeper was not his enemy. He did not deserve that pain.   At once, he took off through the forest, following paths that only the creatures of the wood used. When he had come of age to produce the trolp, or poison that the males of their race produced, his mother had explained what it did. She told him of the suffering, and pain that it could cause. She also told him that it should never be used upon the innocent. Of course, being realistic, his mother knew that accidents could happen, so she also taught her Kretook to prepare a cure.   Unfortunately, the items needed to create the cure had to be fresh, and none were close at hand. Kretook sprinted through the brambles and forest, gathering what he needed as he went along. He didnât bother to stop for food, or water but continued onward night and day. He had just returned to the inn, rapidly set to combining the multitude of ingredients completing the salve, and was quickly scrawling a note, when he saw the female come from the door. With as subtle a movement as me could manage, he had slipped into the brush, and collapsed in a heap. He wasnât sure if heâd ever be let back into the inn, but as he was drifting off, his head filled with visions of the dark haired waitress with the big, deep soulful eyes, and he smiled.            It didnât take Jantell long to realize that things werenât quite as they seemed. Although she couldnât see the source of her discomfort, she could hear the source of it passing through the brush near her. Then it struck her. The odor that she had smelled was the foul scent of magic. She crouched lower than she had before, as she realized that this might not be as easy as she had first suspected. In the darkness of the forest, as in the darkness of her mind, she plotted her preyâs path. Her eyes were all but closed, while her mind was concentrating on her sense of hearing. With the silent, sliding, graceful movements of a kaweyr, she moved outward and upward to a thick branch overhanging the protected path. Laying flat along her gnarled wooden perch, she seemed to become one with the shadows of the bark. She had chosen this spot, for the big shaded gulwarf tree that towered above it. Itâs cottony seedpods gently drifting downward like a million windblown feathers.   From her lofty crook in the branches, Jantell watched the drifting pods, and waited. As the raucous of breaking twigs and shuffling feet grew closer, she waited. As the downward swirls of gulwarf pods began to swirl and altered course, she waited. As she heard the labored breathing pause beneath her, she waited. Hers was the patience of the huntress.   As the stalled pods, hanging in the air beneath her turned to continue on their way, Jantell sprang. Body, knife, and mind, lunging in one swift motion; she was a deadly blur cutting through the air. Partially for sport, but also to inspire fear and confusion, she let a warriorâs cry escape her lips just before the moment of impact. Her target didnât stand a chance. As it hit the forest floor, it rolled to face her. Only to find that ivory blade hovering where his neck would be was his neck visible. She spoke not a word; she didnât need toâ¦ the razor sharp edge nudging at his flesh pretty much said it all.              Trendel didnât move, he realized that was probably his only chance. Still, in the next moment it was just as likely that he would cease to exist in a quick slicing motion, and a sudden crimson blur. Worse yet, the world would go on without him, as if he had never existed. How he regretted his past; he regretted all that he was, all that heâd done, and all that he had become.   In desperation he clenched his teeth, looked up into those lucid cutting eyes that glared downward. He felt her heaving, animal body holding him down, looked upward with wide, pleading eyes, and begged, âPlease, I canât afford to die, not until I have made amends!â He was sure that this woman could render him limb from limb, and without a second thought. After all, he was in her domain now. He had never thought that he feared death. Even now, he suspected that it wasnât death that he feared, but leaving life incomplete and with a bad reputation. It seemed to him like he was finishing off a great feast with something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It just wasnât the way that he wanted it all to end.   It wasnât the act of dying at this womanâs hands that had him so upset. If anything, she was a magnificent creature to whom he would have been glad to surrender his life to. It was just that he didnât want to go, being remembered only as being the Masterâs tool.   The exquisite creature that held him pinned, pulled back so suddenly, he naturally assumed that she was going for the deathblow. Trendel closed his eyes, and prepared for the inevitable. When nothing happened, he risked a peek, just in time to see her standing over him, with a puzzled look on her face as she asked, âWhy not?â   From the expression on her face, he was certain that she was not being sarcastic or playing with him. She seemed to actually want to know. As he didnât respond right away, she repeated, âWhy not? Death is just another part of life!â As simple as that, she had summed it up. Your born, you live, you die. How could he explain that there was more to it than that? There was pleasure, sorrow, disappointment, tragedy, abandonment, deception, wonder, awe, and so much more.   What would any of that possibly mean to her, a creature that lived from day to day, and her only goal survival. What would she know of ambition, treachery, or rejection; and yetâ¦ she had asked, and he was still alive. That surely counted for something.   Ever so carefully, Trendel pulled off the cloak of shadows, revealing his face, then torso, and legs. He could feel her dominating, piercing blue eyes probing through his very soul. âSo little man,â she continued, âWhy should I let you live?â Trendel looked straight into those cold crystal blue orbs for the first time, and said, âTo learn!â The corners of her mouth turned up and her teeth briefly appeared between her lips. He wasnât sure if it was meant to be a smile, but was too afraid to find out if it wasnât.   âVery well, little man, you teach, I learn!â That said he felt her grab his collar one handed, and lift him airborne to his feet. âCome now, you teach!â and with that she dragged him from the safety of the trail, into the heart of her home, the deep woods. As terrified as Trendel was of those shadowed forests, all he could think was how much worse off he would have been, had he given her the wrong answer?               Maeglar trusted no one. He knew Trendel was, if not loyal, at least reliable. âStumpâ, as he called him, held a certain pride in whatever he did, no matter how despicable a deed it might be, or whom he might be doing it for. Besides, Stump recognized true power, the protection that it could afford, and the danger that disloyalty to it could ultimately represent. That was why he was even more upset by the silence coming from the dish that was set before him. Had the amulet been damaged? Had stump befallen foul play? Was he simply not answering his masterâs call? No, he knew better than that! Again he tried to contact his minion, and again he received nothing but silence in return.   Amongst the leaves and sticks along the woodland trail, on an amulet of gold, the image of Maeglar Threxx yelled, fumed, and cursed, and then finally faded into amber silence.            With the wind at his back, and the endless road to freedom, and adventure laid out before them, Andrhus Muesgroehher and his small group of followers wound their way down from Mt. Cark. They traveled onward through The Great Pass, and westward to the lowlands beyond. In addition to himself, there were four others in his group.   Svaulugh was the oldest and probably had the most experience with the outside world. He had been responsible for the most recent maps of the area around Mt. Cark, and was known to be an accomplished climber and spelunker. This dwear definitely knew the ropes, literally. He was closer to Theldharâs age, than to Andrhusâs but cast of a totally different ore than their leader. He was outgoing, jovial, and understood that sometimes risks just had to be taken. Andrhus liked him, and was glad that he was along for the adventure. Especially since where they were going, his skills would prove invaluable.   Knurhl was much closer to Andrhusâs age as well as being one of his oldest, and closest friends. He had been chosen as the scribe and mapmaker for this expedition, as well as his ability to read, and speak several outside languages. He had spent a great deal of time in the archives with entirely too much time on his hands. In this case, that had turned out to be an asset. Besides, it was no secret that he also suffered from the âDredarâ and probably wanted out from the mountain, as much if not more than Andrhus.   Klavhlok was the soldier, the small groupâs soul defender. Although he had initially argued against this addition to their group, Andrhus eventually had to admit that someone with training in defense and bivouacking could come in handy. He had wanted to keep it strictly an academic expedition, free of conflict and politics. As his uncle pointed out, however, wild beasts care little for politics, and will consume explorers, and adventurers just as readily as soldiers, and warriors. So Klavhlok joined them.   Lastly, and perhaps, most objectionably was Frithch Frietz, Andrhusâs cousin and uncle Theldharâs oldest son. Frithchâs responsibility was to be, arranging trade agreements between the Dwearen people and any outworlders that they might meet. Andrhus suspected that this was just an excuse for uncle Theldhar to keep an eye on the expedition. Especially since Frithch didnât seem too keen on the idea of going himself. This was something that he would have to keep an eye on.   For now, though, it was their first day out, and all of their spirits were high. They all seemed to share that sense of invulnerability, which is common to all of those that are new to adventure. So excited were they to be on the road, that none of them even noticed the shadow that fleetingly passed overhead.             Theldhar looked down from the mountain, and worried. He was the leader of a whole race of people, and all of their worries were his worries. Right now, though, all of his thoughts were with the small band of travelers filing out of the valley below; and one in particular. Why? Why had he said yes? Yet he knew that he had been given no choice, not if it even remotely meant the possible return of Thremble to his people. If only Andrhus hadnât found that journal! It had been lost for generations. Why did it have to surface now? Well, at least he had convinced Frithch to tag along and to keep an eye on the boy. He just hoped that it would be enough.   As his eyes strayed once more to the valley below, and he watched the small party filing out of the western end, he thought he saw something large, and winged slip out of the valley and towards the north. There was nothing he knew of that large. Except, well aâ¦ But that was ridiculous; they had been extinct for centuries. It was just the stress, and the worry; they were letting his eyes play tricks on him. Another pang of regret shot through him as he tried to decide which was harder, looking after his entire race of people, or his nephew. Either way, he knew that he wouldnât sleep well that nightâ¦ Then again, why should tonight be any different?              Back at the Elw Inn, Ami sat quietly in the corner, looking into the great stone fireplace. She had finished her morning chores, and being mid afternoon, the inn was fairly silent. Often, she would sit here and stare into the flames, thinking of her past. When she did that, the past filled her head, roaring up from the darkness that was a thousand yesterdays; a past, which was something that she could never talk about. They were dreams that she was too terrified to share.   As the flames reflected in her large black eyes, she wished that she could share those dreams. There was so much that she feared, but there was no one that she trusted. Her cousin, and Tiney had both been very good to her, but they would not understand; they would joke about it or they would mock her. Worse yet, they might even fear her. If only she had someone that she knew that she could trust. She had trusted her parents. She had told them of her dreams, of the fire, the pain, and the suffering, and of the deathâ¦ now they were gone. No, she could trust no one, for if she did, she would risk losing him or her. In silence, she continued to stare into the fire.

         Jantell awoke with a start, and listened for the eerie, mournful noises that filled the nights of the dense forest. There were none, and that had her scared. The deep forest was a primitive, dangerous place. Most travelers knew better than to travel in it during the day, much less at night. To Jantell Sequie it was home. Like any creature in its own habitat, Jantell knew when something was wrong or out of place.        The night birds and the insects that usually filled the nocturnal blackness with their lonely calls, and endless chirping were all but silent.Jantellâs heart raced as she crouched low and slid into the cover of the brush. Almost immediately, her pupils dilated, her muscles tensed, and her hand slid downward, all the results of the adrenaline coursing through her body. A fine sheen of perspiration tinged her brow, but no more than that. Her hand clasped the carved grip of her bone knife, and silently slid it from its sheath. The six spans of razor sharp ivory, hidden beneath her other arm was invisible to any prying eyes in the night.     In the darkness, Jantell could see better than most of the midnight predators, yet she could see nothing. She could, however, smell; and what she smelled was evil. Jantell sensed the odor of evil so strong, and old as to be the reptilian smell of dragons. That of course, was foolishness; the dragons were long gone. Even her old mentor, Saguiah could not remember the days when the dragons roamed the world or filled the skies. Still, that smell was thereâ¦     Even had her eyes convinced her that her nose had deceived her, Jantellâs ears proved otherwise. In the distance, but closing with every moment, she could hear the noisy shuffling of two awkward feet, and the crack of breaking branches as someone or something trudged through the brambles. Jantellâs fears slackened to mere caution as she continued to listen. She realized that it must be an outlander, for no forest dweller, human or otherwise would make that much noise. Even the shirelings from the nearby villages were quieter than this when traveling the dark woods. Jantell knew that she definitely held the upper hand here.                       Trendel had been traveling for a week and a half now on the Masterâs business. In those last fifteen days, Trendel Praor had crossed half a continent and probably seen more than he had in his entire lifetime. True, he had once traveled half the world, but he had done most of that within the hold of a ship, doubled over and wracked with seasickness. Trendel was glad that the majority of this journey was to be overland.Of course, one also tended to see and hear more when one went unseen. As the Master had loaned him the cloak of shadows for this journey, Trendel had naturally heard, and seen more than most travelers would. He was still amazed by the things that people would say, or do when they thought that no one was around to hear or see them.     With a particular fondness, Trendel recalled a certain brothel that he had visited in Porters Trove, his first day on the mainland. If the Master ever found out of his indiscretion, he didnât like to think what would happen. For now though, Trendel had decided that it had been worth the risk. Besides, he could always tell the Master that he had been looking for information about the Masters enemies. As luck would have it, he had learned a thing or two.     The only problem with traveling unseen and in the shadows is that one quickly grows accustom to it, and starts to take oneâs anonymous nature for granted. Trendel had taken to traveling at night, because the roads and trails were less crowded. Less traffic on the road meant less chance of being blundered into by fellow travelers who, for obvious reasons, couldnât see you coming. Sight, however, is not the only sense, and just because one is masked from vision, does not mean that one cannot be found via other means.                     Basil Thrempson, at least that is the name he is using now, sat high atop Lokiâs Peak. Far off to the east, he could make out the first rays of predawn cresting the curved crescent of the horizon. From where Basil sat, it seemed as though the whole of the world was spread out before him. Actually, with the exception of Mount Cark off to his left, and Luciferâs Needle behind him, that was, in a sense, true. He could see from his perch above Dismalâs Descent, well past the Realm of Nomads, and Sea of Sarnad to the Sea of Eternity beyond. Basil had often chosen this place to watch the sunrise, and to contemplate his past, present, or future.     Now he went by the name of Basil. Once long ago, that had originally been his name. For the longest time though, he had gone by the name of Llywiln Ccharr. A dragon name meaning âWind of Changeâ, it had been bestowed upon him by Glymich, his abductor and adopted mother. To this day, he could still fondly recall falling asleep as a child, the memory of Glymichâs huge body and tail wrapped protectively around him. The grumbling purr and warmth of Glymichâs encircling mass are a part of Basilâs youth that he could never lose, even now that she was gone, forever.     Basil had returned to his old name when he returned to the world of men. As he did so again this morning, he wiped the tears from his shadowed eyes, turned from the rising sun, and donned his makeshift wings. Lofting silently into the shadow of Lokiâs Peak, he couldnât imagine where the winds would take him today. Only the winds knew for sure, but he surely would soon find out.                     Theldhar Frietz looked out upon his kingdom. Here on Mount Cark, his word was final, his power, supreme. If only he could convince his stubborn nephew, Andrhus of that. Theldhar was the rightful ruler of the Dwearen people, a direct descendent of Krell the Conqueror. What he declared, no one, but no one questionedâ¦ except, of course Andrhus.     What was an all-powerful sovereign to do? He obviously knew what was the safest, and best thing for the boy. On the other-hand Andrhus was his favorite nephew and completely consumed by the âDredarâ or wanderlust.     The âDredarâ had afflicted his people for the last three hundred years, ever since the âReawakeningâ and the return of the Dwearen people to the surface world. Theldhar couldnât blame his people, six hundred years of life underground was bound to have had its effects on any race. Once Krell had banished the Ogra from their lands forever, and his people had resurfaced to the brilliant world of the surface, it was only natural that some of the Dwear would long to see more of the world. Yet, why must it be Andrhus, his favorite nephew that was asking his blessing? The Dwear are such a small people, and the world that they live in is just so big!                     Andrhus Muesgroehher had been petitioning his lord and uncle now, for nigh on seventeen months. Every time, it had been the same responses, âYouâre not old enough for the journey!â âYou lack experience with the outside world!â or âThe possible gains from your adventure could never justify the risks!â No matter what the answer, it always amounted to the same thing, âNo!â As such, it was with a somewhat dull and ambivalent heart that he once more approached King Theldhar.     In his endless poking about within the ancient archives, Andrhus had found a dusty, dog-eared, weathered, old tome. A journal that had fallen to the back, and been covered by countless stacks of crisper, newer volumes. At first it had looked like so many other decrepit volumes that lay unfiled and scattered about the archives. Then, he had noted the strange hide from which the bookâs cover was sewn. The jacket was a stretched reptilian skin, covered in large iridescent scales. Although most of the primitive binder was filthy, and covered in dust, the hide, itself, was in remarkable condition. While Andrhus had been examining the cover, his eyes noted that it had been emblazoned with a large âK.F.â. It had taken a few moments for the importance of that information to sink in, and by then, he was carefully leafing through his great ancestorâs personal journal.     Andrhus hadnât brought the torn and battered tome to his uncleâs attention right away. He wanted the weathered book to be his own secret, at least until he had read it. For weeks, he had carefully lost himself between those yellowed pieces of parchment, cautiously attempting to transcribe what he could from ancient Dwearen. Much of the text had turned out to be the usual explorer nonsense, weather, directions, landmarks, and encounters. As if anyone would care about the weather when those explorers had been dead and gone for over three centuries, now! After a while, even the random encounters, and occasional combat of that long-ago world had started to sound routine. Andrhus had even contemplated putting the journal back, losing it once more amongst the endless stacks of eternity. That was when his eyes had befallen a name that he had honestly believed that he would never come to see. There on the page before him, almost pulsating with a life and power of its own, was a name that the Dwearen people spoke of in whispers, and reverent hushed tones. There, in shades of sepia and yellow was the name, âThrembleâ!     He recalled that his first response had been shock, and fears that his shaking hands would drop the priceless journal, that it would have hit the floor and crumbled into dust, being lost forever. Andrhus then recalled the over-whelming urge to run screaming to his uncle to inform him of his discovery. Finally, Andrhus remembered the struggle to control all of those urges so that he could use his new found knowledge to champion his cause. While putting his own needs above those of his own people went against everything that he had been raised to believe. Andrhus also believed that Theldhar had been overly protective, and more than a little biased in the treatment of his own nephew. On top of all that, there was the small matter of the âDredarâ. In light of all these events, his uncle would have little choice but to grant his petition                      Trylla Allyra was a free spirit, as free as they come, and probably always would be. Her parents before her had always been considered wild and rebellious. Just imagine, using magic for personal enjoyment, even if it was educational entertainment. Trylla on the other-hand was unique. Among all of the Valley Elw, she was the only one who truly believed that magic should exist for its own sake, and the enjoyment of it, no matter what. Of course, she was also one of only a mere handful of Valley Elw to choose the path that led to âNanjarâ, the mystical state of ultimate bliss.     Trylla was a singer, a dancer, a warrior, and a philosopher. Above all else, she was an elwess, and ever since her coming of age, her bodyâs urges had shaped her destiny, and her goals.Elw, by their very nature, are not a seafaring race. As in all things traditional, Trylla was not one to comply with the norm.     Thus it came to be, that she, and her childhood friend Dunkirk, found them selves at sea in the midst of the Ocean of Passage. Vast and foreboding, the Ocean of Passage was a none-the-less widely traveled trade route. From time to time, both Trylla and Dunkirk had seen heaving convoys of trade ships bobbing on the horizon, and wondered where they were bound, as well as what strange treasures filled their holds from distant far off lands. Trylla also wondered in the back of her mind,   how could anyone stand to travel so slowly?       Trylla and Dunkirkâs craft was much smaller, a mere ocean catamaran. Still the small boat with its single sail seemed to slip from crest to crest of the rocking waves, traveling at almost twice the rate of its clumsier cousins. Their skiff was so stable, even with a full sail that Trylla often found herself dancing to some distant tune, which echoed in her subconscious mind. With her bronzed, curvaceous body rocking to the waves, as well as that silent melody that only she could hear, it was sometimes difficult for Dunkirk to recall that he was just a Gniem, or that Gniems hate water.                      Dunkirk didnât like water. He didnât like waves. He didnât like boats. But mostly, Dunkirk didnât like water! How Trylla had talked him into this one, he couldnât recall. Somehow, Trylla had convinced him that the two of them should board an non-seaworthy craft (all of them were, in Dunkirkâs opinion), sail it themselves, and cross a vast ocean on their own; in another words, to throw their lives away, just to see what it was like. When would he learn?     Trylla had been his friend as long as he could remember, ever since that day when she had found him picking bell-berries in the glade, and had scooped him up just before a flash flood would have washed him away. Since that fateful day when Trylla had saved his life, she had always been able to talk Dunkirk into any of her lunatic schemes. Donât get it wrong, he didnât simply feel obligated; he truly liked Trylla, and even envied her carefree spirit. Itâs just that sometimes, he wished that Trylla didnât feel the need to share quite so much of her excitement with her friend. Especially, now that Trylla and he had been sloshing endlessly at sea for two long weeks now. If he could just live to see land again, he might even forgive his best friend!                  Chance Windham was to the field of ocean travel, what Krell was to the Dwearen people. He had been almost everywhere, seen almost everything, and done almost all there was to do, more importantly, he had lived to tell of it. Chance was the sea captainâs sea captain, fun loving, adventuresome, and braveâ¦ but not to be trifled with. He would just as readily employ former pirates and hooligans, as legitimate sailors, if he thought they knew their jobs. He even did this without fear, for every member of his crew knew that he would scuttle his own ship, with himself on board, before he would tolerate a mutiny on board. He was not a man, which the sea had made that strong. He was a man whom had always had these convictions and who took delight in taking on the sea as his equal. Chance had earned the respect of his crew, and any one of them would give up their life for him, all he would need to do was ask.     His crew, and his ship, âThe Krakenâ had been with him for quite some time. The crew understood that there was very little that could take their stalwart captain by surprise. When Chance peered through his collapsing brass scope and exclaimed, âBy Aquarâs horns!â the crew knew that something truly remarkable was happening. As one, the crew rushed to the starboard rail in order to follow their captainâs gaze.     Out of the endless myriad of waves that made up the horizon, a small speck gradually came into view. As the speck quickly closed on âThe Krakenâ, its sail became visible, and eventually itâs mast and hull, if you can call two pieces of driftwood tied together a hull! To Chance and his crew, it seemed unlikely that such a small boat could stay afloat. That they would find this bundle of sticks and string in the middle of the oceanâ¦ and passing them was inconceivable. As he, and his crew already had their mouths hanging open, it was only a short drop of their jaws to the deck. It was at that point that they saw an attractive, bronzed, young elwess manning the tiller; and of all things, a gniem, safely nestled against the mast!     At first, the crew of âThe Krakenâ supplied a virtual cornucopia of jeers and whistles as the odd craft came into view. The crew quickly fell silent, however, after a stern glance from their captain. Tempted though he was to laugh himself, Chance hailed the odd pair and offered the assistance of ship and crew. With a polite wave, the strange elwess at the helm proceeded right on past âThe Krakenâ towards the gathering clouds ahead.     The storm rolled in out of the clear blue sky. One moment Chance was looking out at the clear azure blue sky, the next, the dark green waves had started to pitch, and the sky had turned a gloomy black. There were clouds rolling in like harbingers of death on horseback. As âThe Krakenâ pitched, Chance thought of that little craft out among the waves, which tossed his ship like a toy. He realized that he had probably seen the last that he, or anyone else would ever see of that boat or the two that piloted it. As the waves broke higher, and higher, he thought he had seen something skimming the surf in quick, darting turns. Then, âThe Kraken was buried beneath tons of water, not once, not twice, but three times. The third time âThe Krakenâ didnât reappear. Instead, he saw the deep green waves pitch, splash, and fill with bodies, wreckage, andâ¦ then Chance blacked out.                      Tiney Rumfinger had been up most of the night. A good part of the night, he had spent counting last nightâs take. The Elw Inn had been relatively busy and there was a good deal of coin to count. Besides, the girls, Blossom and Ami got irritable if they didnât get their tips right away. Tiney was still amazed that after all of these years together they still didnât entirely trust himâ¦ or maybe they simply didnât trust each other.     As far as patrons went, it had been a fairly typical night. Tiney had only been forced to break up two bar room brawls. He only tended to do that if life, limb, or his property was endangered. More often than not, it was his property that concerned him. Tiney was a firm believer that the occasional bar fight served a good purpose. If his patrons were venting their angers and frustrations in his bar, maybe they would be less likely to do so on the outside. So far it had seemed a good philosophy, as his patrons seemed to keep coming back.     Still, his profession wasnât without its risks. Tiney, as irony would have it, was a big man, a very big man. Most troublemakers tended to turn tail; just the sight of him headed their way. His reputation seemed to precede him, all the way across the room. Last night, there must have been a rookie in the crowd, a very lucky rookie at that, as Tiney had a purple bruise and a slight scratch across his left cheek. Yes, a very lucky rookie indeed!     As he ran his fingers across the wound, he realized that he should pour some whiskey on it, just to be safe. As he played the fight back in his head, it suddenly struck Tiney that the odd traveler in the bulky cloak, with the scaly, horned knuckles must have been the one that caught him off guard. Somehow, he hadnât expected someone in heavy cloaks like that to move quite so fast. Oh well, he would live, what was one more scar. After all, they came with the job.                       Blossom looked up at Tiney, lost in thought. âDonât fret it, Sweetie!â Blossom called out, âI think it makes you look handsome!â Blossom always knew just what to say to make him feel better. But he also knew that it was all a facade. Blossom would never wholly dedicate herself to any one man, she never did. As much as she might care about him, to her, Tiney was just another man. Granted, he was a big, lovable, kind man who had taken Blossom and her cousin in without a question. But to her, he was just another man, and always would be. If only she knew how he felt about her in his deepest heart, and most hidden soul.                      Ami was a mystery; in fact, her full name was actually Tanami. Not that she appeared to hold some deep, dark secret. On the contrary, she had no motivations secret or otherwise. Whatever her cousin, Blossom, decided to do; Ami would go along with it. She was shy, reserved, and demure. She lacked the passion for life, and everything else that is considered to make one human. Still, one couldnât help but wonder if she wasnât the type that held her emotions in check, waiting to release them, until she had met the right man, that lucky man that she would some day give herself, and her emotions to. Calhas help the lucky lad.     Beyond the timid exterior, beyond the shy, withdrawn front that Ami put up, there was something more, more than fear, more than repression, more than mere denial. If one took the time to look within her dark eyes, one might catch a passing glimpse, just the tiniest of hints, mind you, of some deep, unspeakable terror. It would be the horrified look of someone that has seen the future.     As it was, no one paid Ami much mind, for her looks, or personality. How unlikely then, that anyone would take the time to gaze within. Yet, someone had!                       Kretook Knarr was an outcast, too hideous to live among humans, and an abomination, cast out by his own kind. Walking upright, a trait that was considered totally unforgivable amongst the Trog, but what could he do. It was the way that he was built. Sometimes, he wished his mother had just crushed him with rocks. That was the humane practice the Trogs had for misshapen or deformed babies. His mother however, hadnât the heart. Instead, she had slipped off with him, to raise him alone to this life in which he had no home, and no people to call his own.     Kretook had the normal facial features of any Trog, huge protruding eyes, narrow nasal slots, and the unique wrap-around mouth from auditory disk to auditory disk. If only he didnât walk upright. But he did, so it was that he came to live among humans, his visage carefully wrapped within heavy cloaks, always out of place.     His life hadnât been an easy one, as such he had built up his resolve against most of the pain and anguish that his world could dish out. Kretook was still only human, though, more or less. Like any thinking, feeling creature, he had his weaknesses as well. From experience, he knew well, how to defend his heart from attacks on his appearance. As mother had always said, âThere will always be those who malign you, but do not despair, they simply do not know how truly wonderful you are!â How he missed motherâ¦     Had the ruffian at the bar simply made fun of him, or of Trogs in general, he would have probably let it roll off his slippery gnarled skin. These two, however, were reveling, boasting out loud, of taking a young Trog female, using her, and then dragging her for miles behind their cart. They seemed to take great pleasure in describing how she fell, exhausted and was pulled torn and screaming to her death.     Kretook couldnât listen to it any more. With the quick reflexes that only his amphibious nature could give him, he reached out and smacked their two heads together. By the time that either of them had the slightest idea what had happened, he had fallen upon them with powerful blow after blow, driving away with the fury of a thundering herd of trusks. At one point he had the satisfaction of hearing and feeling bone snap and give way. What may have been minutes of unbridled rage, seemed to evaporate in seconds.     The innkeepers hand closed upon the back of his cloak and Kretook responded in pure instinct. He couldnât let himself be revealed, not in that crowded room. At best, he would be thrown out, at worst; the same fate would befall him as that which had befallen the young Trog girl. He had let his fist quickly lash out, and twisting free, he had dived for the door. Once he was outside, he immediately regretted his actions, truly regretted them. Kretook meant the innkeeper no harm, but more than that, he would miss the Elw Inn. He would miss it in more ways than he cared to admit, even to himself.     Not only had this inn been one of the few places in which he felt welcome, even if he did still have to hide within his cloaks, there was something elseâ¦     Those eyesâ¦ those dark, haunting eyes of the one serving girl, the quite one with the long dark hair. There was something in those dark eyes that touched upon the sadness that both filled him and consumed him. As he was lost within those deep, ebon pools, something sad and terrifying that echoed ofâ¦ home! Now Kretook would see them no more.                      Maeglar Threxx stalked the musty halls of his keep. He didnât go by that name any longer. Although the threat of the dragons and their confounded magic was long gone, Maeglar had practiced his precautions for so long, and so well that it had become a habit that was hard to break. If your enemy didnât know your name, he couldnât use it against you. For centuries now, he had simply let himself be called master. He had almost let himself forget his name, himself; after all, one can never be too careful.     Too long, it all was taking too long, he thought to himself. On the other hand, he had waited generations; he could wait a little longer. Besides, he had been planning all of this so long that nothing could remain unforeseen. His plan would precede, no matter what the race, and the world; at least the parts worth ruling, would be his to rule. The masterâs scheme was mad. He knew that it was mad. It was his madness however; that he knew would make it work; that, and the Wand of Calhas.     Curse that confounded wand. It held so much power, sitting there at his fingertips, and him unable to use it. He had made some progress in discerning its powers. Yet despite centuries of careful studies, after of course, the initial mishap, the key still eluded him. The Master had been patient before though, now he would be so again. Soon enough, he would strike out at the world from his keep atop the isle of Balor Methâ¦ Yes, when the time was right he would have his revenge, he would strike, indeed!

                  When asked to produce this mission statement, many variables came to mind.  Am I looking at a mission statement for this one project?  Am I looking at a mission statement for a short-term career?  Or am I trying to create a mission statement for the rest of my life.  After reading âDragon Spiritâ and doing considerable soul searching it became evident that it would be impossible for me to do one without doing the other.  My present, my past, and my future are all linked.  Every aspect of my life that I change, affects every other aspect in countless ways and methods.             When I was much younger, I envisioned a set future with set goals. Now, considerably older, and at least marginally wiser, I realize that although I can shape my own future with persistence and determination, it will not be without having to find my footing on a shifting ever changing terrain.  I have dreams of becoming a writer, before that I will be an artist, before that I have walked many other paths.  The important thing is that I have never lost sight of my dream, and that I will never give up on my goals.             The project that I am presently working on for this class, âThe Hand of Godâ mural is just one more step in the endless evolution that is my dreams.  This project opens up so much more of my future on so many levels that it is hard to list them all.  To begin with, this project gives back to the community, not always the easiest of goals, but important to realizing ones dreams none-the-less.  The project also provides me with important skills in leadership, planning, and public relations.  Beyond that, the mural will serve both as an outlet for my creative talents, and as a showcase of my skill to potential employers.  The project will also give me experience in another field of art than simply electronic imaging or the more traditional forms of painting or sculpture.  All of that experience will eventually make me a better, more creative and hopefully more successful writer, if that is what my future holds in store for me.             As an artist, or as a writer, I have to accept the fact that any experience that I have will make me better at what I do.  If mixing paint, laying out grids, and producing circles of paint upon the roof of a building can combine to create an image that is more than the sum of its part. So too can these experiences combine to create a better artist, or a better writer.  In a sense, the subject of the mural is a symbol of my own self, and my own hopes for the future.  By applying circles of color to the roof of a church, I can give the people who see it hope.  By creating a more artistic, successful, self from the opportunities that life presents, I also give hope to myself as well.

       Overview-  The basic proposal for my end of term project is a large scale pointillist painting upon the roof of the church that is located next to the Art Institute of Washington. The painting would appear from ground level as nothing more than an abstract collection of colored circles, but when viewed from above the painting would appear to take the form of âCreationâ from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This painting however, would depict the scene from the viewpoint of God.   Rationale-  I have chosen this project to bring to the public for many reasons. First, the immense scale of the image is sure to draw attention. Secondly, the finished work will be of benefit to the church, the school, the community, and to me. This painting will allow me to not only showcase my artistic abilities, but will also demonstrate my ability to create, organize, and implement a large scale project. It will bring my skills to the attention of the public, but also to potential employers as well. The location for the church is very important as this particular building is located not only a few blocks from a major television station, but on the take-off and landing path for Reagan International Airport. This gives the possibility of National or even international recognition of my work.   Procedure-  The creation of this work is divided into three separate stages. They are permission, funding, and technique. The first step, I have already instigated by contacting the church with a proposal, when and if I complete this section successfully, I will have to repeat the procedure with the city officials. The obvious concerns would be liability which I hope to address by arranging the image closer to the center of the buildingâs roof. This should prevent the risk of falling or injury. The second step involves tools and supplies. To this end, I intend to contact the college to see if they would be willing to fund the supplies in return for the free promotional that the school would receive from this project. The third and final step in this project is production. Production would take place in two separate stages. First the image would be created in the computer lab. Then the computer would be used to break the image into primary and secondary colors. These colors would then be separated onto a grid pattern that would match the rough design of the church roof. The second stage of production would involve transferring the grid to the roof of the building, and then using the computer model as a guide, transferring the image to the roof in the form of colored latex dots. These dots would be created with paint rollers to ensure uniform sizing. For the purpose of completing the image in a timely manner, I would probably enlist the aide of volunteers for the last stage if they were to become available. My estimation for time and supplies would be roughly one week (weather dependent) for the last stage and roughly 20 to 30 gallons of latex paint (6-12 rollers and trays)  Submitted for your approval,  Ford A.
