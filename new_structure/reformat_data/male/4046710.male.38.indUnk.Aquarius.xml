       USA TODAY  reported that someone in the Bush campaign said that people who are in crap jobs should either find a different job or take Prozac.  That sounds like typical Republican "favour the rich and sod the mentally ill" attitude.  I don't know who this person is, but I hope they never have to struggle with mental illnesses the way my wife and I do.  As far as jobs go, I'm unemployed due to my mental illness.  It wouldn't be so bad if workers had some rights in this country, but the employment-at-will doctrine is a cancer that infects our labour force and makes them literally vassals of their employer.

      Even the dogs in this bloody town hate me! I decided to walk to the post office today and on my way home some dog ran out and tried to bite me. If I hadn't been wearing military-issue BDU pants the dog would have been successful. Thank God the little bugger's teeth didn't break through the pants, let alone my skin. All the owner would say is "she's had her shots."

      I am a stranger in a strange land. I come from a larger industrial area and I moved here five years ago to marry my wife. I love my wife very much but I have failed to fit in here. The mindset in a small town is totally different from what I have been used to. I have tried very hard to fit in but I can't. I have clinical depression and this has made it worse. We are planning to move but it can't be soon enough for me.

      Call me Korith. It's a name I made up. It's Klingon-sounding because I've often felt like a Klingon in a human body. I'm 38 years old. I'm a Christian - Lutheran Missouri Synod. I'm a theological conservative but I do not fit the mould of the automatic membership in the Republican Party. I'm against abortion and homosexual behaviour but I think that President Bush has taken this country down the wrong road. 44 million Americans have no health care while he talks about going to Mars. That's a disgrace.

      It seems I may have some form of ADD in addition to the depression and PTSD.  I've found it hard to concentrate for a long time but I hadn't realised that it could be affecting me as much as it does.  The doctor has prescribed Strattera for it.  I can't tell if it's helping or not but it sure has made me feel goofy and had sexual side effects, which I DON'T need!

      Depression really sucks.  Especially when you live in an area where there are no support groups and where people could care less if you live or die.
