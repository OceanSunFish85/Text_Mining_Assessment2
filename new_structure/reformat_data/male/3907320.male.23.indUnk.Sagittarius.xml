      The title is not some gibberish.On the contrary, it is the most amazing number in the world. In fact, it is somysterious that some people even have atoned itGodly status. It is not for nothing that it calledthe Golden Ratio orthe Divine proportion.   Read  urlLink this  article that appeared in  urlLink The Guardian and you'll know what I mean. For those interested in a Mathematical Explanation, you can read it urlLink  here  at  urlLink Mathworld's  website. Understandably, people havebeen fascinated by thisnumber for a very long time and  urlLink this  website contains some very interesting history about the Golden Ratio.   I was more than amazed when I first stumbled across this number. It seems that in all the apparent chaos that the world seems to be in, there actually exists an underlying order. An order that we are not aware of or may be something that we know, yet dont recoginize!This numberdefinitely providesfood for some philosophical thought.   Obviously,lots of books have been written about it. Mario Livio's book,  urlLink The Golden Ratio : The Story of PHI, the Worlds Most Astonishing Number , seems to be extremelyinteresting. One of the book's reviewers said thatLivio leads us through innumerable examples of the golden numberin the book - examples as varied as the breeding patterns of rabbits to optics of light rays - where the same golden ratio appears again and again andfinally Livioasks the question, "Is God a Mathematician?" I intend to read the bookas soon as possible and will let you all about it - if I feel like it!   Before I warp this post,  urlLink this  is by far the most accurate calculation of the golden ratio I found. A never-ending number indeed!

      Earlier in the day I was sorting the pictures of my recent visit to Grand Canyon.Just a look at the photographs makes me want to go back to the place. Oh! What a sight it was.    There's something for everybody to marvel at the place. Geologists will love to study the rock formations at the canyon, Naturalists will want toresearch the complex ecology that the canyon supports, Explorers will want tounravel the mystery thatsurrounds thecanyon, Historians will seek to understand what the canyon has recorded for centuries, Artists will seek inspirationfrom this wonder and the rest of us can just stand there and be mesmerizedby its themajestic presence!    None of man's creations can ever come close to thistruly extraordinary sculpture that nature has created. Standing there at the canyon, you see life in all its glory. And the Canyon stands there, like an ol' grandfather, smiling at thelife forms that thrive onit, that live on it andthose that it has seen evolve. Way down below is the artist that created the canyon - the River Colorado flowing with vigor and youthful zest, continuing to wind its way around the canyon.One of the mostenchantingsights is towatch the entire Canyon sparkle gloriously asitgreets the sun in the morning and laterbids adieu to it. I was lucky to witness the latter andhope to go back to see the former as well.   The documentary, the Hidden of Secrets of Grand Canyon, by  urlLink Destination Cinema throws a glance atthe history of the Canyon. Information about the documentary and a trailer can be found  urlLink here.  While it is very well made, it is all but a feeble attempt to explain the canyon. No movie, no book can describe it. There is indeednothing like being there and witnessing it solemnly - away from the mayhem of life.If there is any place in the world that is worth re-visiting, this one surely is!

      I recentlysaw the Will Smith movie I, Robot and I tried very hard to find one good reason why themovie was made. The producers, in a single-minded questto create mind-blowing action scenes, forget to add amotive behind the 105 min crap they dish out.Thismovie willdeeply scarAsimov's soul for it claims to be inspired by one of his stories. But the fact, however, is that no one needs any sort of inspiration to come up with story like this.   This is one movie where you'd findpopcorns much more interesting andmuch moreexquisitely designed. If you donât buy popcorns at the movie theatre and end up at this movie, God save you and your kind.   As one movie critic beautifully puts it, after the movie, I, Robot,"maybe I should have my own wiring examined."

      Blig, Blong and Blog. That is pretty much the reason why I've begin to blog. If you didnt quite get it, think about it. If you have even have the slightest inkling as to what it may mean, do let me know. I'm quite as eager as you are to find out! But till then, I think I'll go ahead and start rambling, mumbling, grumbling and perhaps even try spreading something intellectual in the future posts.

      I havent posted for a while now and if you are wondering what exactly on God's Green Earth I 'm doin', then you are in luck. I am going to tell you something so profound that you'll even fail to understand what I intend to mean. Thats okay, dont maim yourself for that. But if you are one of those nasty egotistical individuals who doesnt really care about the platonic activities of fellow mortals and yet find yourself reading this then, my dear friend, you are not really what you think you really are! Now I think must go easy on 'really', really. Oh well...  As you probably figured out, I'm try to beat the extraordinary ennui surrounding me by trying to come up something so boring that'll even make Night Shyamalan's piece of absolute crap,  urlLink The Village , look good! For those who havent seen it, make sure you take your sleeping bag with you. Might come handy, trust me!  Anyways, coming back to my recent engagements, I was wondering if anyone would believe if I told them that I am actually a Maori Chieftain and have been hired by the CIA to spy on those I shall not speak of! If you dont believe me, then I'll have to warn you to watch your back the next time you enter an empty elevator! But if you do believe me  (please let me know who you are)  then I think you must have hit your head with a Titanium Brick. Get it straightened out, buddy, and if possible give me the Titanium Brick! I'm sure I can come up with better uses, maybe after knocking you down.  Well, I think you can see exactly where I'm headed next - thats right absolutely nowhere. So before you issue a bunch of fatwas, I promise to post something lil' less demented the next time. Oh btw, the CIA story is all but not true.
