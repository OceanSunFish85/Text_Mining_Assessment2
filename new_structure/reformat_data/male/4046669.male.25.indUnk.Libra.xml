         Monday's game against the White Sox showed baseball fans everywhere that the Minnesota Twins are unimpressed by the Sox' recent roster maneuvers. After all, it gets done on the field, not in the G.M.'s office. In an oft-replayed highlight, Torii Hunter absolutely  JACKED UP  Chicago C Jamie Burke. Just leveled him. The catcher was taken to the hospital and eventually was diagnosed with a concussion. The following quotes from the AP recap tell a lot about both teams:   Torii Hunter: "I wasn't trying to hurt him. I was just playing the game like you should play the game. I'm not a dirty player. I just go out and have fun and play the game. That's it."   Sox Mgr Ozzie Guillen: "If my players don't like it, that's a message. You got to play the game hard. I know if it happened on my side, I'd be high-fiving my players." Sox 1B Paul Konerko:   "He went to the left so he probably made up his mind when he tagged that he was going to do that. Whether that's bad or cheap, I don't know the unwritten rule."  What unwritten rule, Paulie? The one that says a division championship is on the line and we're supposed to take it easy on you guys because Mags and the Big Hurt are injured? We've got injuries ourselves, bro. Henry Blanco, Twins C, continued in a Star Tribune story:    "This is what the second half is all about," Blanco said. "You either get in the playoffs or you get out. If we play like we played all year long. I think we'll get in." Twins P Brad Radke summed it up best:   "It was like a playoff atmosphere. I think this team likes that."

       "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth."  -Gen. 1:1   And, sometime much later, I was convinced to try my hand at blogging.  So, here goes.  I don't know if this will be funny, serious, stupid, or at all sensical, but hopefully "all of the above" will be the answer. Just not  too  serious.  I won't update things every day, but hopefully it becomes something fun and cool.  As long as your feedback is decent, it should be good on both ends, both writer and reader.  So for now, to quote classic rock  uber -band Rush, I'm "Finding My Way"...

           While this bulletin from the Catholic League was released a couple weeks ago, I re-read the following  urlLink press release  and realized it was one of the best-written defenses of the Christian cause and why Sen. Kerry is a wicked bad choice for president, to adapt a saying from his home state of Massachusetts.        August                         5, 2004                                           DNCâS RELIGION ADVISOR QUITS                                                                                                                                                                             Catholic                         League president William Donohue commented today on the                         resignation of Rev. Brenda Bartella Peterson as the                         Senior Religion Advisor to the Democratic National                         Committee (DNC):                                                                                                                                                                      âRev.                           Peterson told Religion News Service that âit was no                           longer possible for me to do my job effectively.â                              The  Washington Post  added today that her decision was made âafter the                           New York-based Catholic League issued three blistering                           news releases attacking her positions.â                                                                                                                                                                                       âThe                           only question now is whether John Kerry and the DNC                           have finally got the message.                              When we exposed Mara Vanderslice as a Left-wing                           activist who cavorts with anti-Catholics, the Kerry                           camp silenced her as its Religious Outreach Director.                              When we exposed Rev. Peterson as a Left-wing                           activist who went into the U.S. Supreme Court on the                           side of atheist Michael Newdow to censor the words                           âunder Godâ in the Pledge, she was forced to quit                           her role with the DNC.                              The first hire may have been a mistake, but it                           is not credible to maintain that the DNC erred in                           hiring Rev. Peterson: they knew what they were getting                           and they knew what happened to Vanderslice, and yet                           they persisted anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                        âWhy                           are Kerry and the DNC imploding on religion?                            Because too many of the elites running the show                           are devout secularists who put a premium on freedom   from                             religion.                            Their idea of religious liberty is banning                           nativity scenes on public property.                            Their idea of diversity is censoring âunder                           Godâ from the Pledge.                            Their idea of tolerance is forbidding a moment                           of silence in the schools.                            Their idea of a good Catholic is Frances                           Kissling of Catholics for a Free Choice.                            Their idea of compassion is hiking taxes.                            Their idea of helping the poor is giving them                           directions to a soup kitchen.                            And their idea of choice is abortion, not                           school vouchers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    âKerry                           and the DNC now have two strikes against them in their                           religious outreach efforts.                              Whether they strike out is up to them.                              Weâre certainly not dropping out of the game,                           and weâre certainly monitoring Bush and the RNC on                           this subject just as closely.â   Memo to Dems: I don't have to quote Terrell "Yo, this is T.O." Owens' "if it walks like a..." speech to figure out that when you practice what you preach (oops, forgot you don't like the word "preach" since it's not "inclusive" enough) we can see that your party and its candidate are not fit to make decisions for our nation.  Think about it: the same party that whined and moaned about how the majority wasn't served when popular vote winner Al Gore lost to Electoral College winner President Bush is now the same party that believes the majority should not be honored because it is "forcing" its views on a minority. What?!? You can't have it both ways, clowns, and you're not going to clown the American people by talking out of both sides of your mouths when it comes to religion and our nation. You think the two are separable, but in fact since our man Geo. Washington was in office REAL LEADERS have known that God and America are to be kept as tightly together as is humanly possible considering our sad state of disobedience. When you separate the two, America falls. It's as simple as that.  While I'm not often a big fan of Catholicism and the twists that it can take in comparison to Protestant or Evangelical Christianity, I'm fully behind my boys in New York on this one. Conservatism helps people on an individual level; liberalism creates a "program" to send money. Who does more? I'm thinking of a parable here: give a man a fish, and he eats for a day. Teach him to fish, he eats for a lifetime. Now look at it this way: give a man a program, he subsists relying on the government; teach a man to fish (or give him a marketable skill) and he provides for not only himself but also his at-risk family. Too bad the Dems didn't think of that...

      As you've read here before, I'm sick of the presidential race and all the crap coming from a certain camp not named Bush-Cheney...and I'm also very sick of the crap coming from both sides in the looming NHL labor negotiations.  The way I see it, Gary Bettman is a bum. He's never understood that hockey is different than the other three major sports, and never has done much to run it in a different manner. Simply put, HE'S AN OUTSIDER. While I know that this is the attitude many pundits say keeps the game from reaching a larger audience, I think that MUCH MORE damage would be done if the league were to lock out the players. Notice the word "strike" is nowhere to be found here--because it's not the players' fault. (Mostly.)  The owners have been saving money for a long time now to live off of while the players are out on the golf courses of North America and Europe when they should be on the ice. In 1993, the North Stars left what wasn't the best situation arena- and revenue-wise in Minnesota for a situation no better in Texas. After then-owner Norm (Sucks) Green said they wanted a building with suites, he moved to Reunion Arena, which had none. Only after Tom Hicks took over the team and a decade elapsed did the Stars finally get to move into the palatial American Airlines Arena which they share with Mark Cuban's Mavericks.  Eleven years later, I'm facing the same prospect from a Bettman-run league; that there will be no NHL hockey when the season rolls around. See a pattern here? It isn't the fact that players like Sakic, Forsberg, Jagr, and Holik can command ridiculously high salaries--it's the league! We're blessed in Minnesota with one of the best owners a fan could ask for in Bob Naegele, Jr., a brother in Christ who gets it--the game is about the fans, we as fans of Minnesota hockey know the game, and we don't need crazy gimmicks to show up and support our team. He and Sen. Norm Coleman (R) gave us what is agreed leaguewide as one of the top two arenas (along with Toronto's ACC) and honored the state's rich hockey history in myriad ways. Bob Naegele isn't the problem here; he's kept team salaries low and proven that you don't have to charge ridiculously high ticket prices or land huge media contracts to run a successful franchise.  In 1993, I could sit in the lower deck at Met Center for $28. Now, I can do the same at the X for $56 a game. Eleven years, the price doubles, albeit the damage could be much worse if we were in a different market. Minnesota sports teams like the Wild and Twins have traditionally had to price tickets more affordably than other Midwestern (see Chicago, St. Louis) cities to fill the seats. Now, it could be argued that the Wild and Vikings don't need to worry because their seats will always be filled, but I think that this takes for granted a big factor: history. Do you remember when the Vikes didn't sell out? The North Stars certainly didn't, the Twins rarely have save for the playoffs, and even with a great team the Timberwolves could only muster some late season full houses. Even the Wild has announced some questionable sellouts in the past season.  The NHL has tried to make the labor situation a clone of what MLB is doing: harp about the product, say the revenues are all out of whack, and then do little to nothing about them. You would think that a more reasonable solution could be found, like the NBA or NFL examples, but two problems exist. 1) NFL contracts are not guaranteed. So, if some clown like Brian Marchment gives you a knee-on-knee hit and you're out of the game, good luck getting any money. Think back to the Brian Berard situation a couple years ago; I'll bet if hockey had employed NFL-style contracts that a good Rhode Islander like Brian would have been filing a grievance because the team probably would have dropped him altogether. 2) The NBA system is almost as complicated at the U.S. tax system with its midlevel exceptions, Larry Bird exceptions, and everything short of a George Mikan exception. And then you get into the whole dollar-for-dollar luxury tax (hello, Glen Taylor, thanks again). Critics say this would effectively curb spending by teams like the Rangers, Blues, etc., but has it stopped several NBA teams? Has increased revenue sharing seized upon George Steinbrenner's Yankee pursestrings? Of course not. Big markets will always act like big markets because they can, and the Edmontons, Buffalos and Calgarys of the world can't keep up with that.  Having said all of this, it still (unfortunately) comes down to management and the PA. And, from this  urlLink story on ESPN.com , it looks like we're in for a long, cold wintry lockout unless somebody slides a couple of firecrackers under the doors in the executive offices of these adversaries, er, counterparts.

        Good news, Wild fans! Both Andrew Brunette and Willie Mitchell have  urlLink re-signed for the upcoming season .  Both players have become fan favorites amongst the Xcel flock, and great things are expected from both players in the season to come.  Last season Brunette was 15-34-49, leading the club in assists and finishing second on the team in goals behind Alexandre Daigle (20) and Marian Gaborik (18) while appearing in every game. Concurrently, Mitchell played a strong defense as always while compiling a line of 1-13-14 with 83 PIMs in 70 games played, a career high.

        I'm getting sick and tired of the speculation there will be no hockey season this year. The kid inside of me--stuck somewhere between 1991-93--says that it will be a great season, that Minnesota will go deep in the playoffs, and Brett Hull will score 80+ goals. Come to think of it, that actually  did  happen in the early 1990s... Instead, I'll give my undying devotion to a team piloted by the genius/devious (depending on your perspective) Jacques Lemaire, and we'll probably win 35-40 games while scoring roughly 2.4 goals a game. Oh, and for the naysayers, I borrow a quote from the LEGENDARY Patrick Roy...Jacques would love to hear your complaints about his system, but he can't hear you because of the many Cup rings plugging his ears. On the subject of the upcoming season,  urlLink Wild assistant GM Tommy Thompson spoke with ESPN.com  on the team's offseason as well as its expectations for the coming season. Thompson looks for big things from new acquisition Brian Rolston, as well as a full campaign from scorers Pascal Dupuis and Marian Gaborik. Manny Fernandez has re-signed with the club, continuing the two-goalie strategy the team has enjoyed since its inaugural season when Jamie McLennan tagged with Manny. Whether or not Dwayne Roloson can reestablish himself as the clear #1 goalie remains to be seen, and I will anxiously await the results regardless...Let's Go Wild!...(and for that kid inside me who still wants the North Stars to win the Cup--Belfour Sucks!)

          A quote from the  urlLink compilations  of brotherly blogger Ted Olsen:  "  An abstinence-until-marriage program is not only irresponsible, it's really inhumane  ."      U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Ca.) , at July's International AIDS Conference in Bangkok. Meanwhile, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni told conferees that abstinence was the key in reducing his country's infection rate from 22 percent in 1992 to 7 percent in 2002.  One question here: is she out of her mind? Or, better put:  I expected nothing less ridiculous and self-serving from a Californian feminist liberal representative  (and I use the term "representative" very, very loosely--after all, whose viewpoint is she repping for but her own? You can't tell me a majority of Calis actually feel this way.)  Look at this issue another way: if your young child wants to touch a hot stove, do you hand him an oven mitt and let him touch away, hoping it doesn't catch on fire, or do you tell him to stop touching the burner? Because that's the kind of argument she's making here--that people simply cannot be stopped from practicing irresponsibility and that the inevitable conclusion where people contract deadly diseases like AIDS isn't the fault of the people involved. After all, it's also "inhumane" to expect people to not drive drunk, right Ms. Lee? I mean, they have a "right" to get drunk after all, so just how can we say they shouldn't drive? If her comments weren't so wickedly stupid I wouldn't care, but 10 or of 10 doctors can tell you that if you abstain, later you won't feel the pain. And no, pundits, Johnny Cochran wasn't the expert who came up with that line...

          A year ago today, Herb Brooks died north of the Twin Cities.      His legacy, examined more intensely in death than in possibly anytime of his life, was further exalted in the public's eyes by the release this past February of the movie   Miracle  . (And by the way, if you haven't seen it yet, I'm simply not talking with you anymore--it's easily one of my all-time favorites.)      Now that Herbie is gone, the members of his 1980 Miracle of Ice team are taking a little extra care to   see each other more frequently  . The stories still flow, the memories undying, the men now joined by kids of their own at the get-togethers. One of the constants, however, is the unfailing devotion they have, even in death, to their hard-nosed coach, Herb Brooks.  The USA will play most of its games in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey in Brooks' backyard, St. Paul, and there are few more fitting tributes I can think of than that.

        While I generally think that President Reagan and his wife Nancy (some would say much more Nancy than Mr. Reagan) did a good job in raising kids who were respectful of others and of God, I have to take issue with Ron Reagan's appearance at the Democratic Convention and his speech on stem-cell research. This is something that I don't personally think we should endeavor into. Why? Who cares why, since other people who disagree with me on many other issues don't seem to always have a great answer to that as well. (Do you like that for a response?) Frankly, I just don't think we need to make the sacrifice of one human life (embryonic or otherwise) to allegedly save another. (Isn't that the basic premise of abortion, by the way?) Writing a  urlLink good editorial on this topic  is Wesley J. Smith in a recent Seattle Post-Intelligencer column.

        If you've read any of Bill Simmons' columns, you know he's a huge NBA fan. Now, the NBA Network is going to let him run a whole day of programming and he's mulling over   his selections  with viewers.    Personally, I don't know enough about the NBA circa 1985 to give good advice, but I'd definitely have to vote for more Pistol Pete classics...and not that lame one when he was first drafted on the Hawks against the Suns they've shown after his SportsCentury, either.

          For those of you who don't know of Luis Palau, I'll give you this hint: he's not the second baseman for the Minnesota Twins--that would be Luis   Rivas  . (Nice home run today, Luis!)      Palau, however, is a slugger on a much larger scale, that of telling the world about the Good News that exists in Jesus Christ alone. My man Luis, who recently concluded a two-day festival on the steps of the state capitol in St. Paul (you know I'm kicking myself that I wasn't there) traverses the country on an always busy schedule--with the sole purpose of telling more folks about Jesus. He also writes frequently, and I am most impressed by his thoughts in a   recent column  :      "America's simmering pot of politics is set to boil over. From now until election day, we'll hear a lot about "political power." And once again, according to a survey by the Barna Research Group, the 'born again constituency' of American adults may emerge as a key voting block in the presidential election.  "That power tempts evangelicals to trust in political answers to return America to biblical values. As followers of Jesus Christ, we should know better. America is in trouble because the great majority of its people have yet to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior.  "I thank God for my friend Rep. Steve Largent and other Christians in Washington and for leaders like Dr. James Dobson who are using their freedom as Americans and their influence to uphold righteous standards for the nation, enact common sense policies, and awaken the people's conscience. But without a wave of conversions to Jesus Christ, nothing we do can restore a common commitment to biblical values. America has a heart disorder that only the Gospel can fix."

        There are a lot of people out there whose favorite pastime seems to be downing the Department of Homeland Security as though it were secretly cleansing what music they listen to in the car of any possible foreign influence or doing something equally subversive. In all actuality, it's not like that, but we in America are famous the world over for overlooking our liberties and complaining about the little things (myself included). In fact, this may be one of the myriad reasons the bad guys hate us so much.  I find it very interesting--and yet I totally don't expect the mainstream media to cover this--that a Finnish professor who taught at Fuller Theological Seminary has been  urlLink banished from the U.S.  due to visa issues connected with the HS department. While most secular mouthpieces and others harp about how it's always the Muslim or other so-called minority group (reminder to the complainers: Islam has many more adherents worldwide than Christianity)  being molested by Ridge's representatives, here is a good reminder that such rules are like a double-edged sword.

        Sports lists seem to be the hot item of 2004. ESPN seems to do one about every 3.72 seconds, FSN just hired former Olympian Summer "Down boy, she's married" Sanders to host the appropriately named "The Sports List" and at this point Letterman is probably looking for a new gimmick now that everyone's stolen his niche. In reaction to all of this, Bill Simmons couldn't take it any more. So, he decided to set the record straight, once and for all, on just which sports movies are truly the greatest. Not the top 10, not the top 25. Oh no, SG is much better than that. How about 72? And it all kicks off with #30 (again, he didn't put them in order for a reason, no false drama here),  urlLink Varsity Blues .

          In a classic (if only for its utter inanity) blast, while campaigning in Michigan Sen. John   Kerry accused President Bush   of encouraging terrorism with his policies against those who wish us and our countrymen dead.      Folks, this is nothing but hilarious. First off, Kerry says that Bush's decision to accept the 9/11 panel's recommendation for a new intelligence director is too slow and not far-reaching enough. Then, he goes on to say that if Bush were serious he would call Congress together at once to vote on such things. Funny, but I don't remember Kerry or his VP mate John Edwards seeing fit to fly back to Washington to vote on what was one of the most important social bills in the nation's history, the Marriage Protection Act, which was a precursor to the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment. So, why should we believe that Kerry would suddenly "find" the time to head to our capital city and vote in favor of new anti-terror measures. Isn't this the same guy who didn't even want to support funding for our troops already overseas fighting the very terrorists he says the President is too soft on? Good grief.    Finally, quoting from the article:      Kerry said the Bush administration is encouraging the recruitment of  terrorists.      "The policies of this administration, I believe and others  believe very deeply, have resulted in an increase of animosity and anger focused  on the United States of America," Kerry said. "The people who are training  terror are using our actions as a means of recruitment."            No, senator, the policies aren't the problem. Just as fanatical rascism was once prevalent in many parts of this country, now fanatical Islamism reigns in terror in the    Middle  East   . No amount of hand-wringing and diplomacy will fix this. Simply put, you either nip this threat off at the bud, or it will eventually nip your country again.

            For those wondering what my credentials are in commenting on the PCUSA and its recent actions, it should be noted that when I lived and studied in Chicago I attended a great (PCUSA) church, Fourth Presbyterian. This beautiful building sits directly across the street on N. Michigan Ave. from the John Hancock Building and was site of an important time in my spiritual growth as a came to know Christ. It was here that I first started to attend church regularly, and I very much enjoyed the teaching of Dr. John Buchanan, Fourth's very well-read and respected senior pastor. While I no longer worship in any Presbyterian body, I feel it important to comment on one denomination's trek toward insignificance.  (Yes, that was a rather strong statement there.)      You see, the PCUSA has recently   voted to cut all investments   in any companies that do business with Israel. If you're of the Judeo-Christian persuasion, that's pretty much like someone saying they won't ever do business with the folks at home--because Israel is our spiritual home. Biblical prophecy (like the sort documented repeatedly in Dr. Michael Evans' book,    urlLink The American Prophecies )   continually points toward Israel as the ultimate battleground on which the moral and political skirmishes we face today will be settled. This would be enough to feel concerned over, but it doesn't end there.    PCUSA leadership has also recently   voted at the July General Assembly   to keep "actively" gay pastors and elders from presiding over local flocks. Now, you're probably saying, "Lepke, I thought you'd approve of something like that. What's up?" At first glace I would, but then I read the fine print. In other words, scroll down toward the end of that article I just linked.      Here in the same assembly, the PCUSA decided to become less a Christian organization and more like an everyday secular group. After all, if others can't see the light from your faith (because you've dimmed it to match the world's darkness) or taste the saltiness in your faith (for once salt loses its taste it lacks value), what's the use? This points to Matthew 5:13-16, where Jesus calls His followers to be salt and light for the earth. In other words, to take a stand and not conform to the prevailing winds of cultural thought. In essence, He was saying that if you don't maintain your difference from the rest of society, eventually it will forget what makes you different and you basically become a member of the whole rather than the selected (by God, no less) few.      Through all of this, the encouragement of states to offer extension of "equal" benefits to gay employees (since when do we as Christians encourage our states to act like Disney?) and telling the Washington PCUSA office not to state an opinion on a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage is accomplishing the sad outcome I harshly supposed at the beginning of this piece. It saddens me that some of our brothers and sisters in Christ are being jaded by society and fooled by those veiling anti-Christian thoughts and values with the guise of "equality."      Ask most veterans of the   real   Civil Rights Era and they'll tell you what it means to fight for basic freedoms. Theirs was a fight to bring our nation to greater togetherness; today's supposed "civil rights" lobbyists want nothing more than to undermine the basic premise of marriage by pushing at all costs an "anything goes" mentality.      Folks, "if it feels good, do it" doesn't pay the freight. It never has. It never will. And if you don't believe this, just go ask your local Greek or Roman Empire agency down the street. What's that? They don't exist? Their empires long since have crumbled under the weight of such hubris?      My point exactly. Now, here's hoping that the mission of that wonderful place where I first cut my teeth consistently on Christianity, the beautiful old building in the 800 block of N. Michigan Ave. in Chicago, never becomes irrelevant, especially due to the policymaking blunders of a few higher-up types at some conference.

        I found it interesting that the Kerry campaign has to bring in a senator from out of state to campaign in Minnesota. Is there a reason for this? The second question one must ask is: doesn't a senator usually represent  his own  state? With that in mind, here's an excerpt from MSNBC on the  urlLink candidates' travels :   In the Mankato, Minn., area, Bush was highlighting a national program that provides incentives to landowners to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and replace it with grass, trees or wildlife habitat. The 2002 farm bill Bush signed would provide $40 billion over the next decade to restore millions of acres of wetlands, protect sensitive habitats, conserve water and improve streams and waterways near farms and ranches.    Kerryâs camp sent Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin to Minnesota to criticize Bushâs level of support for the conservation program , saying Minnesota has seen fewer acres approved for enrollment in the program.        </post></Blog>
