      actually i lied.... today im quite free.... shld i do the stupid jing shen jiang ppt? haiz....  today when i was queueing up by the side of the auditorium i was so nervous to go the stage to recieve the tt prize. it was my first time to get a prize from mr yue and the whole school would be looking at me, so i was so frightened.... u believe me? hehe... im lying.  all those who saw that mr yue was going to give out the prizes, ppl started to say that after shaking his hand muz go and disinfect. my sentiments exactly.  the spotlight today was on ms chan shouting at zixuan. actually i could see she was mad. maybe. she's a deceiver. people just cant look thru her mind. i was quite shocked that she managed to raise her voice and boom the whole class. zi xuan was trying to rebel. no use. ms chan obviously could get the upper hand and roar back at him. it was fun seeing hydrochloric acid put with zinc. she went thru that twelfth nite (or is that how you spell it) so chimly no one could understand. i like her lessons. she's a good teacher. realli.  the ss test today was crap. mind me for saying this, hopes mk does not invade this space. i hate ss tests, but not elit. ss you have to think more. you have to rush like a mad dog. mayber even madder. think about it. for an english paper 1 you have 1.5 hours to complete a compo, a few pages (maybe three). for ss, you have 6 questions to answer, with 1.5 hour. how to complete and get high marks with the answer levels so tough. i bet the teachers cant even attain the levels. todays test was still okay lah, actually. the decontextualised questions were still do-able. think i can get b.  still have some geog stuff to do. muz get b for geog. muz get b for geog. must get b for geog. haiz.................  that's all today.

      Today is really den considered my first proper journal entry. had quite some fun critizing child. i noe that this will not be shown to ppl but it still vernts my frustrations. i quite happier now. right, back into today's topic.  i have things to do. that is for sure. chinese file ( sway sway). physics ws. dianes hw. cheryls test. zuo wen. eng file. i can only hope to sleep by 12 tonite.  i still have to go for my sickening cca tom. y...... i want to quit. howeva, cheng liang and pals are there. theyre fun ppl. better than the farm animals (sorrie ms chan for quoting) in my class. the animals in my class are horses and chickens onli. i dun think i can do a lot this week in sucha  short time. pray i will get enough sleep and not fall into hysteria the last time.  bubble has an illness. her hands are filled with hotspots. for unanimal lovers, hotspot is where a part of the animals body has an infection and no fur is there, with rough skin. it looks digusting. wonder how charcoal and trouble are doing now. hehehhe...  should i stop? i dun want to... but i need to rush with my work entirely... will come back soon. hope i wont forget my password here.......  " tomorrow is a new day. dwelling about the past is not a thing in my life if i want to suceed. be brave. conquer the world."

      wat's up with life..... i dont think im suited for this treatment. the people around me are bullying me that's for sure. eugene is the sissy... not me... i dont go around telling people theyre sway or wo ying ni... wo shu ni.... so wat if i have higher marks, or you have higher marks. whats the point of comparing so much until you dont notice that youre becoming arrogant. i heard frm favourable peeps that you were tough to be a good friend to, youd be boasting and wanting your way. I now know that youre childish. i know its childish to do this, pricking ppls back behind like this, but i find this effective in venting my frustrations against ppl like you.... wat "pal" are you in the first place... i dont see the right in you calling me not being a "pal", for u yrself dont treat me like one. you call me names... shen jing bing( you do that to everyone) and when i act blur whats the point of scolding me and asking me to empty the rubbish bin just for your sake of wanting to throw some minute litter waste into the bin? i dont get money from you as your maid or wateva, and you dont have the right to treat me that way. i noe i seem dumb in not shouting back at you, for i noe that it is pointless doing so... youd just irresponsibly think of some lame stuff and dismiss the argument. so who says i dont treat you like a pal.... think before you speak. is your brain malfunctioning or wat? in the last term, when you said that you were "becoming stupid", did i say hahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahah...... i doun think so.... think before you speak. when i helped you to print notes for bio did i go around saying you must be super super super super grateful to me?, while when you printed a notes for me you rattled the whole day asking me to do work just because of your "work" magnificently done. think before you speak.... really... when i was sitting on the chair of liling's today was there a need to come and shout some wat the hell malay word and laugh so much on it. I had to act as if i knew its meaning and slap you off like a mosquito. what's the supid point of bullying me like that... only babarians do that... do you feel very happy to see me sad? if you are, welcome to the sadistic club. if you arent, youre just a few stones throw from the club. cant you see other ppl not bullying me? wat's in the word sissy that you find amusing to call me? is it the "si" or the "ssy", let me tel you, the definition of sissy is a person like you, going aroung not caring about ppls thoughts and feelings ( i just used a rubbish term) and just laughing off your chair at peoples misery. it's not only me youre doing this too, poor verena is also shot by him many times for saying that her voice is like a mosquito( she does not). whats the point (i noe my vocab is limited) when you just voice out at teachers shouting out vulgars? to MK( our beloved form) and ms soh? is it cool? is it fun? you never learn from experiences. that day ms wong had already caught you and you could still laugh about it. there is no sense of guilt and shame in you... you are a shameful little brat. only always wanting to win( hey theres no such thing as a smooth road with setbacks). You cant win all the time. dont think you win once or twice then zhan zhan zi xi... you dont tell yourself to work hard or comfort ppl ... wat kind of sickening attitude is this? is going to the bb court more often makes you a man? wat are you? trying to boast that you have completed your work and have a lot of time to go play bb and so you can luagh over me and my sorrowful misery? o... i forgot... ppl like you have the most free time to sleep at ten and be hao lian over it... saying you have learnt this topic and this topic... and they are all VERY EASY.... i mean, how can a person say that. other ppl have not learnt this yet but why must you give "VERY EASY" comments about it. So wat if you think your popularity has risen or decreased? are you like trying to compete with me whos more popular also? wat the hell.... i just have to hand it to you... being able to stay hao lian for such a long time. Wait till one day you cant survive... let's see you fall...
