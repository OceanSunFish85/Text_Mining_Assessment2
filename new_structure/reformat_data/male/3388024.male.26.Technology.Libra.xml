        urlLink Coolest thing ever!   The original site was shashdotted, so I mirrored it on my server.

       This morning I had my intro Flight lesson.  This is where you learn all about what it takes to be an actual, real world, honest to god Pilot.  We spent a good hour just talking about stuff, but the short answer is, it takes a lot, but less than you may think.  What I learned was it will take about 18 months to get to the point where I can reasonable expect someone to pay me to drive their expensive taxi around the sky, less than I thought.  It will cost around $35k to get there, more than I hoped.  Now, my passengers would be of the create-and-barrel kind, but at least I wouldnât have to hand out peanuts.  The money thing is kinda daunting, thatâs a lot of greenbacks.  But as it turns out you can get loans much like student loans from college.  The company recommended to me has decent interest rates that are actually tied to the British prime rate, so Mr. Greenspan canât mess with me much.  All and all Iâm not sure where this will lead right now.  Iâm still doing my homework while I decide if I want to take the BMW sized plunge.  Like a good geek I did go strait out and get a copy of MS Flight Sim 2004.  Not sure if it will help or not, but how often can you justify a new game as a Life Change Exploration Tool.

       My wife, with her recently acquired Theater degree (go Daen!), might not find  urlLink this  all that funny, but I think itâs hilarious.  Mostly cause Iâve me these type of people before (cough) Mellon (cough)

       I have 2 turtles at home, so I'm kinda glad they make them  urlLink check ...  ""Ironicallyâ¦at 300 takeoffs and landings a day, nobody asked us to ever do a tortoise check. But before I can clear a spaceship to land, I have to do a tortoise check of the primary runway," Witt said."

       I work with  urlLink Jr High/High School kids at my Church .  It really is a good deal of fun and I like hanging out with them and mentoring them (although much more of the former happens than the later).  This weekend we did a BBQ in a park with like 6 other churches.  It was an awesome time.  We had a couple bands singing, lots of food going, and Preach-off with all the Youth leaders.  It was just really neat to hang out with everybody in a public place and eat, play, and praise god.    I think people tend to lock their faith into whatever building they worship in, and thatâs kinda sad.  People should be free to express themselves where ever they are, and people should allow others to express themselves, even if they disagree.  Thatâs really what being an American is all about I think.

       So we bought Daen a new portable MP3 player today.  It was an open box item from Best Buy.  I wasnât to sure how I felt about that, but it saved $25 and they said we could bring it back anytime in the next 30 days if we werenât happy with it.    Daen opened it up in the car, and as it turns out the previous owner has left some charge in the battery and 25 gigs of music on the hard disk.  Now I know all people are weird, and Iâm sure to outsiders my personal music library would seem rather odd, but this was like super or even mega odd.  It was a mix of Nâsync, Backstreet Boys, Bob Marley, Aerosmith, some Christian stuff, Ace of Base, and a whole bunch of Romanian stuff.  Who knew Romania had music??  Hmm, if this was a Simpsonâs episode I think it would go like this:  Strange Guy: Iâve got NâSync or Romanian? Bob Marley: Ewwwwâ¦ give me some Romanian.

       Seems the 6 year old PII-400 Gateway my wifes been using just isnât cutting it any more.  Its been through a few upgrades to keep it functional over the years, new video card, more RAM, and a new hard drive recently.  But I guess no matter what you bolt onto a Pinto, itâs still a Pinto. The wife says itâs prone to random issues and something about a sticker stuck in the CD drive.   So I ordered some new parts today from  urlLink Newegg.com .  I used to be loyal to  urlLink compuplus.com  but my friend Brian turned me on to the egg.  I bought the bits for my  urlLink shiny computer of total goodness  from them and I was very happy.  My DVD drive died at one point and it was a synch to get it replaced.  I highly recommend them.  For the geeky out there I went with the AMD 2500+ Barton CPU.  Same one I have.  Pared it with and Abit board and 512mb of PC2700 ram.  This, with the 80gig 7200 rpm drive she has, should make quite an improvement.    Iâd have to say the best find was the  urlLink Lite-On CD-RW/DVD+/-RW  drive for under $80.  The reviews for the drive on the site were great and it seems to work with pretty much any format.  I opted to spend the extra $10 for a faster drive, but not the extra $5 for the Retail packaging.  I guess well see how it works, but I must say Iâm excited to see how the new DVD writer works with this other  urlLink software  I think Iâm gonna pick up also.

       I've bought many toys in my day.  For some reason I'm just drawn to shiny things, that beep, or do neat stuff.  It's even better if they look cool and cost a lot, which means they're quality after all ;)  Most of the time the honeymoon with these new wonders is rather short lived.  They get used and abused daily for a few short weeks, then they are relegated to the garage, closet, or Goodwill.  Because of this I've become a bit jaded about the whole thing.  I tend to drewl over things for a while but almost never buying.  I just picture the poor things fate, locked away in some dark corner covered with dust, never to live up to it's full potential.  My view of toys changed however when I bought a  urlLink 2004 Yamaha Vino Classic .  It was red, chrome, cute, and absolutely ridiculous.  And I rode it everywhere.  It was, at the time, the best toy I ever bought.  My wife liked it to. In fact, most days it was a fight over who got to ride it that day.  Parking being what parking is at almost all Universities she normally won the fight.  See, one of the best things about a scooter, other than the insanely cheap insurance and 65mpg, is that it normally can be parked at the bike racks.  This is, of course, ends up being much closer than she could park otherwise.  The disputes lasted for several months.  After a while I just couldn't take it any more, this was my ball, and I didn't want to share!  So I made the fateful decision to visit  urlLink New Urban Transport .  A company her in Albuquerque specializing in higher end scooters.  When I walk in the doors I found the toy that would forever steal my heart.  It healed the pain from all my previous man-machine relationships gone bad.  It was  urlLink silver and shiny , with big wheels and nice curves.  I had to have it.  Needless to say it went home with me that day, and we havn't been apart much since. I can tell you it's a joy to ride, goes a good bit faster than my other bike and seats two.  The wife and I run around town on it all the time and laugh a secret laugh together whenever we pull up next to a 28 foot family assault vehicle.  If anyone has any interest in a scooter I highly suggest you find a local dealer and give one a spin.  You may agree that itâs the best toy ever.

       My dear friend  urlLink Jason  kinda talked me into doing this.  I guess we'll see where it goes.  You never know, I often feel the need to rant so this might just work out.

       For the very few of you that read this thing, I wanted to let you know that no, Iâm not dead.  Iâve just finished 2 weeks of trainings in Washington (state) and a week of vacation.  Iâll right some of it later, just wanted to send out a heart beat single to those of you that care.

       I did my FAA Medical check today.  Seems they have strict rules about who can fly an airplane, who new.  Apparently my 20/200 vision didnât thrill them so I have to wear my glasses to fly, but seeing how I have to where them to drive, walk, or even dress myself I guess itâs no shocker.  All and all everything was ok, I do have to get a note from my regular doctor that says my diabetesâs is ok and Iâm not going to go into hypoglycemic shock or anything equally as troublesome to paying passengers.  But again, no real shocker.  So thereâs another easy way out closed to me.  For some reason following dreams means doing scary things, like changing.  And so far god has not seen fit to bless me with an escape route back to my old daily routine.  So here I march, afraid, down the path to possible happiness and a feeling of fulfillment.  Life just stinks some times.

       I got back Monday from a Mission trip to Napoleonville Louisiana. We took 11 teenagers and 5 adults from the church to work on homes for a week. I can honestly say that anyone with a negative impression of teenagers today is hanging around with the wrong ones. I was personally blown away by they kids and how hard they worked.  Their were over 400 kids at this particular camp. They divide all the kids and adults into teams of 6. My team was pretty darn good. We had three girls, the oldest being 14, and 2 boys, the oldest being 17. None of the girls would have weighed 100 lbs soaking wet, so the hammering was left to the guys. The house we worked on was owned by Veria and Arthur Jackson. Originally we were assigned to paint the house and put up new gutters. But, we also decided to replace the facet and soffet on the back of the house and extend the roof tin a bit. All in all we got the work done with a few hours to spare on Friday.  Really, the work is not supposed to be the primary concern. The spiritual growth of the kids and the residents is the most important. As it turns out Arthur is the senior decan at his church, so he definitely mentored more to use than the other way around. I personally got a lot from the experience. Meeting them and seeing how other people live and how you can be happy even when you donât have much meant a lot to me.  So all and all a good time. The 40+ hours spent driving the 15 passenger van could have been shorter, but I think it would take an act of congress or god to move Louisiana closer to New Mexico. Thankfully people donât seem to get too mad when you cut them off in a car with a big cross on the side, go figure.  We did stop in Six Flags in Dallas, and that was a good time. My stomach wasnât up for a lot of rollercoaster action, but it was fun just being there with all the kids.

       A nice  urlLink friend  of mine hooked me up with a gmail account.  My email address is  urlLink mhzjnky@gmail.com . Most people should probably still use my Waywardsun account, but it's neat that I have one of these too!

       So a couple of weeks ago Daen and I set out for a giant loop around the western US.  Basically we weâre going to Royâs wedding.  After several months of campaigning, and a couple of back room deals, Roy had selected me as best man, so I felt compelled to attend.  The wedding was in Bozeman so we drove to Wyoming Friday afternoon, stayed the night, and then drove on to Bozeman on Saturday.  The wedding itself was on Monday so we had plenty of time.   The bachelor party was Saturday night, and in perfect geek style, involved 4 xboxes and plenty of Halo and Crimson Skies.  The wedding itself was a lot of fun.  A friend of Royâs drove in from Pennsylvania and cooked an awesome three turn (aka course)  meal and I ate more than I thought I could.  The next morning Daen and I left for Idaho for stop two of the journey, but not before waiting for Pickle Barrel to open to get some sandwiches for the road.  Oh, and it was worth every minute of the wait, they are as good as I remember.  We then spent two days in Sun Valley Idaho.  When I was growing up my family would always spend part of the summer there.  I hadnât been back for about 10 years, and it had changed a bit, but not too much.  The most interesting thing for me was how much smaller everything looked.  I just seem to remember the resort property being so much biggerâ¦  I guess I was a tad bit smaller back then though, so Iâll take that excuse over any âThe world is shrinkingâ options.  Daen was nice enough to tolerate my 2 day stroll down memory lane, where we did more looking and talking about things than actually doing them.  We ended the trip with three nights in Vegas.  Iâve been there before, but never with my wife.  I think we both had a great time.  We rode all the rides, including the new one at the Star Trek Experience, and saw a couple shows.  I had never been a but Circus Ole (no, thatâs not how you spell it, but itâs the best I can do) fan, but seeing it live is a whole other thing.  If you ever get the chance I HIGHLY recommend it.  Except for Zoomanity, that show wasnât very good, but the rest is great.  On the 8 hour drive home we realized we had driven all around Utah, but never ventured in.  Iâm sure thereâs some meaning to that, but I wonât speculate on it now.  We did stop in Grants New Mexico to visit the only 4Bâs outside Montana.  Those not from Montana wonât know what I mean when I say â4Bâs Tomato Soupâ, but those who do know will understand why we stopped and got 2 bowls to go.  So that was the trip in a nutshell.  Not a large nut shell, but not a small one either.  Letâs call it a peanut shell, one that has three nuts in it.  A long bumpy shell with three main spots.  In fact,  I think that about sums up our trip actually, and long ride (2900 mile, 40 hours, 100 gallons of gas) and three destinations.

       So at long last I finally broke down and bought myself a new car.  The Taurus was an ok car that I canât really complain about, but it was never really me.  I had hoped it would get me through college and my first year of working.  Well, now that college is many moons behind me I figured itâs about time to make good on the deal I made with myself.   So, after weighing all my options, I decided on either the Saturn Vue or the Haundi Santa Fe.  I didnât want another car, but I didnât want a real SUV either, something in the middle.  It had to seat 5 comfortable, be baby compatible (you never know!), and have at least 200hp (the most important part).  After driving both the Vue was the clear winner.  It felt bigger inside, rode better, had a higher level of finish, and most importantly has a silky smooth V6 made by Honda.  The Montanian in me screamed when I opted for the 2WD version.  Unfortunately I live in the desert, and thereâs just no good reason to get lower fuel economy and higher insurance for something I donât really need.  Plus, if I can get through the worst winters Montana had to throw with a front wheel drive, drum break, car, I think I can handle it with 4 wheel ABS and traction control.  So I was riding high on my new car vibe for about 6 hours, then I read about some safety test that the Vue didnât do well on.  In fact the article I read made it sound like my car was minutes away from the tires falling off.  Needless to say this took the wind out of my new car sails rather quickly.  I imagined myself driving the Pinto of the 21st century.  Thankfully after doing some internet research and reading the report from the NTSC I figured out itâs not as bad as they made it out to be.  Apparently the local news didnât have any crack houses or babies in wells to report on so they just dug up whatever they could find.  Tomorrow theyâre running a story about how escalators can eat your children.  I did find out that Saturn is a great company, and typically dose the right thing.  In fact, if Iâm not happy with my car in the first 30 days I can bring it back and trade it for another one.  I also found out that half way through â04 they changed the suspension around, so my car isnât even affected by the problem.   So in conclusion Iâll say this:  Saturn = Good, Honda Motor = GREAT, Going easy on the car for the first 500 mile to break everything in = no fun, having only 200 miles to go = Good, Jeremy = Happy.
