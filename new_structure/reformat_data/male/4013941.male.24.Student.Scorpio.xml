						   So from the first blog its every evident that i am weirdo.. well i think this one would just cement the fact that i am an absolute weirdo.. . I had many crushes in life and this blog is about the latest crush which i had in my life.. This happened about a month and half ago. I was coming back after my visiting my relatives.i was waiting for train inChengannur Railway station( for those who don't know abt thisplace, its a small town in alleppy district in Kerala).   I saw a pretty good looking girl on theopposite platform and she got my full 5 mins airtime. Because by that time my train came and so i had to leave. Well everytime i go for a trip i inadverently develop a liking towards girl(s), so looking at her and appreciating was nothing new for me. But this is different because i still remember her face distinctly, though i saw her face only for 5 mins that to when u she was sitting in the opposite platform.   Well the rational guy in me say it as an anomaly in the matrix( Refer: Agent Smith, Matrix Fame), But i don't know whether its just an anomaly because i am a pretty detached guy( atleast thats what i feel :-)) and i forget ppl pretty fast. Then u ppl may ask me what am i trying to say.. well i liked that girl so much ( u may call it infactuation , but i say a value added term "unknown attachement") that i wish i could meet her again in my life. Well i don't know her name nor what shes doing.. so lets see if i am that lucky..

						   " Samoj and Passion, Please don't joke", that would be the first response of people who know me. WellI was always said a "sensible", "rational", "non risky" guy who would be one of the last person in the world who would dare to utter the golden word of passion, which is perceived as by many as a irrational feeling.   Coming to our main topic whether i am passionate, its a tough thing to say. I have never thought about it. I dropped a crush in Engineering college because i felt that it would affect my career ( Still don't know howit0 would have affected my career).. So "samoj" seems lika a insensitive non passinate moron.   But if I stop for a moment and thinkwhether I am a non passionate moron as many think or Am I a more complete human being with emotions like passion and sensitiveness. Well I think,I am a bit of passionate guy, though I have never noticed, I have spend a lot of time on seemingly trivial things ( by my rational part of mind) , spending a lot of energy trying to do things just because it gave a lot of satisfaction and completeness.   Then do we need passion in life ( sounds like crappy "MBA" stuff rite!!! sorry boss, u have come to this god damn blog). A "rational" mind's analysis of passion is something wekeeps your adrenaline pumping, which gives you energy even though youare physically and mentally sapped of the work.
