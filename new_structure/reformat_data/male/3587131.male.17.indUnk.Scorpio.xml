      Hiding from the rain and snow Trying to forget but I won't let go Looking at a crowded street Listening to my own heart beat  So many people all around the world Tell me where do I find someone like you girl  (Chorus) Take me to your heart take me to your soul Give me your hand before I'm old Show me what love is - haven't got a clue Show me that wonders can be true  They say nothing lasts forever We're only here today Love is now or never Bring me far away  Take me to your heart take me to your soul Give me your hand and hold me Show me what love is - be my guiding star It's easy take me to your heart  Standing on a mountain high Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky I should go and see some friends But they don't really comprehend  Don't need too much talking without saying anything All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing (Chorus)

      The truth is tearing up my heart I can't recognize this place The endless road without a stop sign Can't even find a stranger this time Why am i still holding back my tears  In this loneliness there's nothing to fear Every chord still seems a wonder How we could be together  Every time i ask if this would be the last Why am i still talking to myself Hoping you will have the keys to my cell Every song might calm the weather but it just draws me deeper  How do i get out of this I think i never will A crystal forming in the eye Maybe this would be the last The winding path down my face Till i begin to taste the bitterness inside   by æä¿æ°

      Jun  Jen were a pair of young couple...Jun was veri charming  many girls could`t helpfalling in love with him... therefore, he became quite a flirt.As for Jen, she was an ordinary girl with average looks. Although there were quite a number of guys chasing her, jenonly had Jun in her heart.altought She knew that one day Jun would eventually leave her ..she still continued to love him whole heartedly...Jen loves rainy days...she loves playing in the rain,  whenever Jun wanted to join her, she'll always stop him from joinin.Jun then ask her; Why don't you let me join you?Jen replied;Err..er..because i don't want you to fall sick.Jun then ask her again;If playing in the rain will make me fall sick, then why are you still doing it?But each time Jen will always keep quiet  smile at him...Although Jun was`t able to join her, he felt happy. To him, as long as Jen was happy, he'll be happy as well. :)However, nothin last long... Jun soon fell for another girl after two months. He even love the girl more deeply den he love jen One day, while Jun  Jen were having their dinner , Jun told Jen that this would be their last dinnertogether... Jen looked at him. She knew dat this was going to happen, but she choose not to ask any farther...Jun then requested for a break up.. And Jen...she accepted willingly... partly because, she knew...Jun was just like the wind...never stop at any point.That night..it was to be the last time Jun send Jen home.. Jen kept veri quiet...although deep down she wanted to know the reasons but she choose not to ask. Just when Jen was about to step into the lift, Jun stop her. He said;Jen, I'm really sorry that i've let you down. But i'll never forget those days when i see you playing in the rain...those are the most happy  unforgottable memories i had with you After listening to Jun, Jen could't help it but cried..Jun hugged her tightly. He said:Jen, There's one question i wanted to ask you long ago... Why is it everytime when you are playing in the rain, you just would`t allow me to accompany you?Jen was stunned..pausing 4 a few seconds,Jen replied...Because...Because i don't wish to let you know...I'm was crying
