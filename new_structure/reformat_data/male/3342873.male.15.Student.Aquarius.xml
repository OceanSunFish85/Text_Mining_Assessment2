      Firstly, thanks to Black Lotus for his input.   THE RACE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE:   This was certainly one of the weirdest races in recent years.  We start the race with Panis stalling his car, before he gets into position. This results in a restart. Finally, we get back into position, and the race begins again. Panis stalls his car for a second time, but the team manages to get the car into the pit lane, and he subsequently starts from there. During the second start, Sato manages to fly off the line (which some say was before the lights went out...) and clips Schumi, forcing the Red Dragon back into 5th place. Klien puts himself out of the race at Loews. (Which is odd, with it being the slowest corner in Formula 1 .... This leaves 19 on the track) The first few laps are relatively uneventful, with Renault in position 1 and 2. (Yes.....) There's some weird smoke coming out of the back of Sato's Honda, but they think it's just an overfill of oil. In lap 3, Sato's car gives up all hope, and a burst of smoke bellows out of the rear, covering the entire track and bringing the race to a near stand-still. Sato is out. (Leaving 18 on the track) To clear the smoke, Fisichella decides to use Coulthard's McLaren as a ramp and succeeds .... in landing upside down against the barrier. Fisichella and Coulthard are out of the race. (Leaving 16 in the race) The next 2 and a half laps are under the safety car.  The race is fairly uneventful until lap 13, when Webber rolls to a stop. (This leaves 15) Lap 15 ... Pantano has an oddly long pit-stop, only to come out and have his car blow up on him. (This drops us to 14 on the track) Bruni pits in lap 19 and doesn't come back out again. (This leaves us with 13). Raikkonen pits for a long time in lap 30. Pulls away, but then seems to change his mind, and retires instead. (We now have 12 on the track, people) Lap 43 comes along and Alonso decides to use his Renault to clean the wall on the exit of the tunnel. (Dammit, Alonso....) He fails hopelessly in his cleaning efforts, but succeeds in giving Ralph the finger while his car is still spinning. (That's my boy...) (We now have 11 on the track) Safety car ..... again. Everybody decides to pit ... except for Ferrari. (Oh, that's smart...) Lap 46. Safety car is still out. Schumi is in P1.  They go through the tunnel. Schumi decides that Alonso didn't do a good enough cleaning job inside the tunnel, so decides to lend a helping hand. (Or a helping left-front tire...) That puts the world champ out. (leaving us with 10) Ralph, pits in lap 73, (for the 3rd time) and, not wanting to leave his brother in the lurch, persuades his car to blow up. (Down to 9, which is where we stay ... at last) The final 3 laps were really suspensful (for me, anyway ... my Renault's in the lead), what with Button driving so well. Finally, it's all over.  Trulli takes his first ever win.  Button is right behind him, in second. Third place man is Barrichello, who is ........ almost an entire lap behind........ The rest of the runners are all more than a lap behind. (Hey, it's not often that you can be more than a lap behind and still be in fourth place...)  All-in-all, one of the strangest things I've seen in a while. But I loved every minute. (If only for the sheer comedic value...)  Let's hope we can have the same kind of action at the European GP next week.  See you guys there..........

      Well, hardships aside, the race at Monaco was non-stop excitement from the start. The hightlight being the showdown between second place Button and first place Trulli. Onb the last laps Button pushed the race to it's limits when he came within 0.4 seconds of Trulli. Rubins Barrichello finished in a comfortable third behind Button. Only nine racers remained in the last five laps with Ralph Schumacher having to pull out. It was Trulli's first F1 win and a well deserved one at that.

      After a having to restart the race due to Toyota driver Panis stalling, we've seen BAR Honda driver Sato cut Michael Schumacher off, forcing him into fifth place, as Renault teamates Trulli and Alonso take the lead. Later on Sato's engine would gush out a blinding thicket of smoke causing David Coultard to crash and forcing him out the race. The safety car has already been deployed several times for other incidents. All of this occured within the first thirty laps and left only fourteen racers. Later Michael Schumacher would move into third and begin to build pressure on the Renault drivers. As I type this second place Alonso has had crashed and is now out of the race in addition to Michael Schumacher! Both had unrelated crash incidents inside the tunnel, both within four laps apart of eachother and the drama continues to unfold!

       SOME CLARITY ON THOSE WHO SUCK AND THOSE WHO DON'T:   I always hear people talking about things like, "  That team sucks  ", "  Why do they bother racing?  " and my all-time favourite, " Why can't they all be as good as the Ferraris? ".  This is a misconception of GINORMOUS proportions. Let's break this down a little. We'll start at "Qualifying times..."  Anybody ever notice how the difference between the guy who qualifies in 1st place and the guy who qualifies in last place, is around 3 to 5 seconds? That's not a helluva gap. (Okay, in F1 terms, that's a country mile...... but anyway)  At the end of a race, the gap between the guy who comes first and the guy who comes stone last, is around 1 to 1 and a half minutes. After a 60 to 70 lap race, that's not ALL that much, really.  The major thing to consider, is the fact that there are only 10 teams in F1. (The 10 'best' teams in the world). There are only 20 drivers in F1. (The 20 'best' drivers in the world). This has got to say something.........  For all those that want to mock and make fun of the teams/drivers that aren't doing too well, just sit back for a second and consider that these are the 'BEST' in the business. You think you can do any better, prove it.

       THE F1 RANT BLOG GET'S OFF TO A FLYING START:   This being my first post, I want to use it to welcome all F1 fans out there. I will be posting updates after every race of the season. (I will back-log and start at the first race). I won't focus too much on Driver / Constructor points, as those can be found anywhere. I will mostly be posting my thoughts and views on each particular race. (Granted, most of those thoughts and views will be a little biased, as I'm especially a Renault fan .....) I love Renault, coz they're my favourite. I hate Ferrari, coz they keep whipping the Renaults. I dislike Minardi, coz, well honestly, they suck.......  But that's just me.  NB: A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO Black_Lotus, Garson007 AND THE REST OF NAG CREW...... MEET THEM ALL HERE AT   urlLink NAG

      Shot a docie for radio-controlled hobbies today. Or rather a segment of it: off-road, gas-powered radio controlled cars. The other segments include plains and helicopters. Very interesting, and a lot of fun. Great, good people. Anyway, after that, went home, went to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I was really looking forward to it. And no, I'm not disappointed, but it could and should have been better. The teachers, whom added so much flavor to the previous offerings, were absent for most of the movie. Characters and events werenât fleshed out well enough, and something just felt missing. Other than that, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and I'd easily recommend it. Just don't go in with the same anticipation as I did.

      It's today, as opposed to yesterday and tomorrow. I wish it was tomorrow, seeing as today it was the same old, same old. Tomorrow at least I'm watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not commenting on that, though, I'll have a more informed opinion tomorrow evening. Today, was, for a lack of a better word, very average. I know I covered this allready, but that's exactly how the whole of today felt. Had its moments, everyday does, but otherewise...*sigh*. I am still strugling with whether or not to finish up my studies, or go do something productive. Yes, they are often mutually exclusive. I might have more to say tomorrow, stay...connected?

      Guess this was inevitable. Wednesday has arrived, and is, thankfully, almost over. My first published work arrived : The colours of Life, from the international library of poetry. Would love to celebrate it properly, but alas, no money. Why can't they, and with "they" i'm referring to the elusive, unkown, always-present, mysterious 'them'. Why can't "they" give or reward success with free booze? If a south african achieves something, shouldn't we celebrate, or at least congratulate? Anyway, ignore this as just the woes of a troubled mind. And remember alcohol is actually bad for you. *sigh* Wish someone would read this and be kind...

      Yes, well, now that I have to study, the time is crawling. Funny that. Not much happened today that is worth sharing. My car is finally registered in my name. After a month of hassle with Nebank (useless buggers), meaning full insurance coverage will shortly follow, meaning I can now drive my car anywhere I want. Life is all about these little freedoms. When you're restricted, life gets hard. Real hard. Something as simple as a bank hiring lazy, good-for-nothing morons, can screw up a whole month. No insurance, means your car is unsafe. Period. Park outside for just a minute...are you really gonna take that chance? No. But its not only this. Many things. Small thiings we take for granted. They all equal small freedoms. None of us want them taken away. Advice? No, I don't have any. Sorry. This is something we're all going to have to learn to deal with, for ourselves. Best of luck.

      Yes. That's it exactly. Got the results of last monday's used-to-be-reffered-to-as-debacle's results back. They're bad, but not that bad. In fact, they're so "not bad" that it is enitirely feasible to continue on with what I was. In other words, I'll probably finish my Masters. Damn, here I was thinking I should get a job and start making good money. Another dream down the toilet as it were. For now, anyway. To be rather blunt, to not continue now, would be plain stupidity. It might not be what I want to do, but giving it up now, would mean I wasted 6 months for nothing. Might as well take another year, and be called master for the rest of life. Until I get my PHD ofcourse. *sigh* Life really does trip you up, and maybe, this, as previously thought, might not be the worst thing. In fact, it might turn out to be the best. But I can't help feeling dissapointed, that another opportunity for change, is gone. Ah well, such is life, I'll just it back and enjoy it. What else can I do?

      Hell, what am I doing? Is this what it comes down to? Typing the story of my life in a little brown box? *sigh* And we come to it. Too soon maybe, but I've allready repeated my title, so I better start explaining it. Life , imo, has developed the incredible abillity to trip you up when things are going ok. We all aim for supreme 'ok-ness'. I was there damnit! I had it. And then, in one foul swoop, last monday morning, at 10:50am, it was gone. What are you left with? I can't answer that. What I do know, is that tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life. No really, the end result of monday's debacle is made known. Then, maybe, I can finaly start to move on. *sigh* Yes, that's how I feel. But you know what? This place aint so bad, it's just the waiting that becomes a bit much...

      Almost everyone likes / loves their music. Music is an integral part of their lives, whether we choose to believe it or not.   Many listen to music in their cars, their homes even outdoors using discmans or whatever device they prefer. We canât get enough of it. For many, music has become a drug, a psychological addiction.   And this is the main question of this articleâ¦    Is music bad for us ?   Well, firstly, what is music ? Waves, music exists in the form of waves that have been modulated by a device. These waves exist in the form of electronic pulses that travel through a number of other devices, to an amplifier and then to an output device of some kind, such as a speaker.  Thatâs all very well and good but it still doesnât help us work out whether music has a possibly negative effect on us or not. Or does it ?  Music is extremely complex. The waveform that our computers and sound reproduction equipment can store and reproduce has an extremely high resolution, meaning that a lot more than a beat, and instrument and a few words can be contained in a small track of sound. A good example of this is Dolby Pro Logic, which can detect encoded tracks in music found on DVDs.   DVDs are encoded with sound tracks that actually have several other sound tracks encoded into the main sound track. This system can successfully carry up to 22 smaller sound tracks in two larger sound tracks, demonstrating the quality of a pair of sound tracks.  ...again, where am I going here ? Well, Iâm leading up to an interesting point :P  So, we know our music today is extremely complex, we know the quality is also very high.   And now for the linkage...   We as humans only use approximately 10% of our brainâs capabilitiesâ¦ the rest belongs to our sub-conscious mind which, it has been demonstrated, is able to process subliminal messages where our normal mind cannot or sees nothing.  Our sub-conscious mind can implement ideas and information included in subliminal messages in our lives or our actions, like hypnosis.  An example of this was demonstrated when a movie was edited to have an image of glass with water in it every 25th frame. The audience watching this movie didnât notice the altered 25th frame, but their sub-conscious mind did, and after a few minutes, at least 85% of the audience got up to get something to drink, almost simultaneously *insert twilight music here*.  It is now possible for subliminal messages to be included in musicâ¦ simply because the raw quality of the waveforms we listen to are highly complex. It is possible to find these messages in some artistsâ music using professional sound editing software. I will not mention namesâ¦  Happy thinking !

      These last two weeks has been so long and so boring.  I'm even considering writing a book for myself. Just to let the boredom settle a bit. Maybe I'm to used to a hectic life. Cool thing is I'm happy, happier than I have been the past month. Owell getting to the point.  What is boredom really? Is it a Human invention? Is it instinctive? Where does this phenomanon come from? I have no idea, but I do have my points. I beleave boredom is a human creation, somebody invented it, without thinking of what might happen. What did the cavemen do? They did not know boredom, because they did not know how it is without boredom. Same goes for animals, their lives are so boring, but they are not bored, because they don't know a better feeling. So is anything that enlightens you a bad thing? Not neccesarally, but don't go and enjoy yourself to much, if you know it won't last long. For it will just cause boredom, even if that action was fun before knowing a better one.   So what am I saying? Boredom is a creation if you enjoy what your doing to much at a particular time...

       IS VIOLENCE PART OF OUR GENETIC BUILD-UP?   I recently heard the story (on  urlLink NAG ) of a guy who, for no apparent reason, was stabbed while walking along the beach. This got me thinking about violence without provocation......  Perhaps our human nature, in itself, defines that we, as human beings, do not require a motive to be violent. Perhaps we are inherently violent and simply spend most of our lives trying to keep the urge at bay. (Even subconsciously)  Is it at all possible, that we are born with the natural tendencies of violence, but are groomed ... from young ... to ignore it?  Children, with no proper social up-bringing (and even some 'with'.....) will instinctively fight and argue over a favourite play-thing. I've seen many cases where children as young as 12 months, instinctively lash out when something they like is taken away from them......  As a species, we have learned to harness most of this inner-hatred, but it is still there and occasionally rears its ugly head. (Think unnecessarily violent road-rage...)  The wild-men of yore, used to knock each other senseless with clubs. Are we really that much more advanced than the wild-men we once were? Perhaps we've simply found new and improved ways of 'clubbing' each other...............

      My first post as generalkoffi.  (There's no "_")  In light of the U.S. Debates, I have been thinking about the new world order and where Earth is going.  As everyone knows, the United States invaded Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations.  Whether this was good or bad depends on your point of view.  The US is silently declaring itself the supreme power on Earth.  What I want to know is, what will happen when the world's lifeblood (oil) runs out?  The middle-east, which the US is so interested in, will essentially become poverty stricken.  Will China, the worlds largest country, become a new superpower?  Will the US slowly sink away, like Britain did, when it's oil empire crumbles?  Will the United States collapse quickly and dramatically?  China would also be devastated by the loss of oil, but China has 20% of the world's population.  How will we transport anything without petroleum and how will this affect global politics?  It's all very depressing to think about, and this might happen before I'm middle-aged.

       TO FORUM OR NOT TO FORUM ... THAT, APPARENTLY, IS THE QUESTION:   I remember a time when forums were a place you went to when you needed help with something and had to ask the world. I remember a time when the only people who actually hung around forums were the technical geeks. I remember a time when chat-sites were the ONLY way to converse online.  Things have changed since then.   Nowaways, forums are more generalised and allow room for open-ended conversation. Nowadays, forums have developed to a point where friends can be made (or lost...). I have found that more and more people have been gravitating towards the use of forums because of its many benefits, and at the same time, have been leaving the chat-rooms across the net, empty and bland.  I think the major contributor for this phenomenon is due to the fact that, unlike a chat-site or IRC, you have time to consider your responses and formulate your phrases. This is somewhat of an ego booster, as it can make even the densist character seem witty and intelligent. Perhaps someday, chat-sites will fall away altogether, leaving forums as the only means of online chat.  Doubtful, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?  BTW: Visit my blog at  urlLink SybAGreY's F1 Rants   Thanks to B_L for giving me the chance to add my views in here.

       *This is an editted transcript from IRC channel #nag on Blabber.net (Part 2 can be found lower down on page)*   *Black_Lotus* okay... now I see  *Black_Lotus* you're saying that things like the Geneva Convention and the UN are jokes when there is a global superpower basically controlling the world  *Black_Lotus* and that we shouldn't cry over the deaths of three soldiers because they are soldiers  *Black_Lotus* now, I agree with you to a certain point, however, just because the UN and other countries can't enforce those rules doesn't mean that we should just throw them out the window  *Garson007* Try telling that to the USA Generals Black_Lotus  *Black_Lotus* I agree that the world and UN haven't done enough in forcing justice to America (after all, invading a country no matter what is still against the rules) but that doesnât mean that there are people out there who want total anarchy and violence and have nothing better to do than kill  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus : do you wish to live in the real world or the fake one ?  *ayjayess* do you have any knowledge of the Sarajevo (Croatia)  *ayjayess* the Serbs...etc.  *Black_Lotus* ayjayess: I am optimistic to a point. "Live as though the world is as it should be to show it what it can be"  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* do you have any idea how long it took the UN to respond ?  *Garson007* Black_Lotus :  Remember USA was going to attack Iraq, doesn't matter if UN gave thumbs up or not.   *ayjayess* do you have any idea of what the UN saw and yet the did nothing ?  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* aye  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus : very nice quote  *Black_Lotus* ayjayess: but at least they intervened to a point. Look at Rwanda! Nobody did shit.  *Black_Lotus* here's my summary:  *Garson007* Arghhh if it does not concern the USA it gets vetoed  *ayjayess* YES!  *ayjayess* if the US can't profit, it doesn't matter anymore  *ayjayess* if the us isn't going to get hurt it is disregarded  *ayjayess* *US  *Garson007* USA has so much power in the UN...  *ayjayess* they basically fund the UN is so many ways  *ayjayess* The UN owes its power to the US to a certain extent  *Garson007* Plus they are part of the five. They can veto any decision  *ayjayess* yep  *ayjayess* like the race conference held by the UN in 2001 here in Cape Town...  *ayjayess* it wasn't held because the US decided it wasn't going to be a part of it  *Garson007* Russia, USA, UK. ETC is part of the five  *Black_Lotus* I understand that the world is a shithole at the moment and has been for some time. I know that the UN and NATO and Britain are all America's puppets and that they are too afraid to hurt the trade and global super power. But this shouldn't cause us to forget that there are rules and structure, right and wrong. I know that not all Americans are war supporters or killers, neither are all Muslims, Indians etc. If we forget our...  *ayjayess* look I do agree that society (the world) should strive towards a system that they abide by (rules) but to say that that system actually works in practice is ignorance  *Black_Lotus* ethics and morals and fail to question and debate then the world will turn into a real crap hole. You have seen the images of children with the soldiers in Iraq. There is a lot of good being done at this moment (Red Cross, UNICEF, Salvation Army etc.) but we forget all that because the news is riddled with violence, hate and lies.  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus  : good is being done, yes, but the motivation, thatâs what we are trying to address isn't it ?

       *This is an eddited transcript from IRC channel #nag on Blabbernet*   *Black_Lotus* Many wars throughout time have been unjust... I understand that these things are out of control and I can see your sentiments because we don't want to live in a bad world, but cheering for one side without reviewing the other is wrong  *ayjayess* we do live in a world where a lot of good is being done, all I'm trying to say is that often the motivation behind a war (like Iraq) was not correct  *ayjayess* furthermore, we are dominated by a super power whether we accept it or not  *Black_Lotus* I believe the U.S. has less than 20 years at being the global super power (that is, unless John Titor is correct), but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S  *ayjayess* yes, a system exists that defines rules and an organisation, but do we actually adhere to those rules ?  *ayjayess* or do we adhere to them when we want to  *Black_Lotus* America cannot rule forever and that is what the rest of the world is failing to see. They are in a recession, unemployment is the highest in years, their currency is failing and global opinion of them is plummeting.   *ayjayess* The US produces so much itself, sanctions won't hurt it and even if it does, the US can simply take what they want when they want if it became ugly enough  *Garson007* but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S *-- didnât you mean not...  *Black_Lotus* America does not have the agriculture sector to sustain it's populating (SA and a few others do)  *ayjayess* no, he wants them to place sanctions on the US to prevent them from creating the war on Iraq  *ayjayess* so the US would start to starve if sanctions were imposed, yes, now it makes sense  *Garson007* Black_Lotus: It's called black-marketing, more money for smugglers  *ayjayess* but still, the US can simple take what they want because that situation would cause them to try to survive and they are big enough to do what they want  *ayjayess* the black market ain't large enough to sustain part of a country that size  *Black_Lotus* I am not stupid. I know that with sanctions the US would most likely invade Mexico or something, but even then, would the people of their nation no begin to question their leaders?  *Garson007* Black_Lotus: Civil war, john Titor  *ayjayess* well, I'm sure Hitler was questioned...  *Garson007* But, Hitler fought with spirit behind him, USA citizens are already uneasy  *Black_Lotus* In the times of Hitler there were never the communication advances of today, "Email, fax, telephone, internet" Information cannot be contained anymore  *ayjayess* yeah, liberty and freedom in America may cause the people to impeach their president but still, people want to survive, it is their instinct  *Black_Lotus* Garson007 ---*(Black_Lotus: Civil war, john Titor) was about to say that maybe that is how the civil war might start  (Breakâ¦ No Debate)  *Garson007* Like I said in my quote post thingy. "People want a leader, people want freedom. Make up your minds!"  *Garson007* They can't have both  *ayjayess* people like to believe they are free</post></Blog>
