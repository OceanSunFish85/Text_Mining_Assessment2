       So, in the spirit of selecting artists who are completely unconnected to the previous dayâs choice, Iâve decided to follow Kraftwerk with a Scottish band whose debut album,  Tigermilk , was limited to 1000 vinyl copies â though it has since been re-released. In their first few years, the bandâs cult popularity was fuelled by their apparent disregard for the media, while other bands were answering interviews and going on tour Belle  Sebastian retreated to their huts in the mountains and lazed about with a selection of good novels. Admittedly I made that last bit up, but itâs what Iâd like to imagine them doing.   urlLink Belle  Sebastian â Get Me Away From Here, Iâm Dying   When I first heard of Belle  Sebastian their bizarre name - it actually comes from a French television series about a boy and his dog - threw me; I was expecting a sort of Carpenter-esque duet. It turned out they were nothing like the Carpenters; in fact Stuart Murdoch, theband'svocalist,has never even sung a duet of any sorton a Belle  Sebastian record. Get Me Away From Here, Iâm Dying, like the rest of their excellent second album,  If Youâre Feeling Sinister , is an understated folk-pop gem. Throughout the album the band shows an incredibly astute sense of lyrics and a sharp wit; this song feature my favourite couplet of the album as Murdoch almost cheerily notes: âNobody writes 'em like they used to/ So it may as well be me.â Belle  Sebastian have since gone on to become less media shy and even performed a commendable set at this years Glastonbury. Their more recent albums have become increasingly âconventionalâ and, whilst the albums following  Youâre Feeling Sinister  are good own respect; the band have never really come close to equalling the endearing characters and beautiful melodies they created on their 1996 album.

        Yesterday saw the showing of James Cameronâs  Aliens  on TV. Iâm not usually a fan of his films, theyâre a bit overblown for me and this did little to change that perception. Iâll admit it was quite engrossing, but I found the ending totally unbelievable â why would Ripley go back to rescue a girl she only recently met from an Alien nestwhere ten or so well-trained marines had been slaughtered while sheâd previously been unwilling to try and help save the lives of the hundreds of people in the colony? Despite that minor gripe though, it was, for the most part, enjoyable and the âget away from her, you bitch!â line was particularly rousing â hurrah for feminism! Or is that a misunderstanding?  At any rate, the film got me thinking about alien music and, in place of some music which really does come from another planet, I thought Iâd bring you some music which merely  sounds  like it comes from a different planet. Yes, I bring you Kraftwerk.  Kraftwerk - Showroom Dummies  Of course everyone has, at one point another, listened to Kraftwerk; in my eyes they are to electronic music what the Beatles are to Pop/Rock; but, before I started exploring most of their albums, I really only knew them as the band whowrote The Model. Anyway, I've been listening to their 1977 album  Trans-Europe Express  and was very impressed with the package as a whole wonderful melodies, of a calibre rarely found on electronic albums interwoven with chugging beats and distorted vocals. The above track stands out not only for the revolutionarybeats and bleeps but also for the wacky lyrics. How many other artists could write such a hypnotically beautiful song about a subject as apparently mundane as mannequins anyway?    urlLink [Buy Kraftwerk -  Trans-Europe Express  from Amazon.co.uk]

       So, the starting blog post. I thought long and hard about how to begin this blog, some Beatles perhaps, or Beach Boys, James Brown, Clash, etc. In the end, I decided there were too many "classic" artists to choose from, so I just picked a band who I've been listening to recently. That band was Television.Their debut album,  Marquee Moon  (1977) ,  is aclassic to be sure- debatedly the bestalbum to have come out of the CBGB's scene of the '70s -but it's aless well known classicthan  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ,  Pet Sounds ,  London Calling  etc.   Television - Prove It (MP3s are taking a while to get working - should be done soon)   A couple of months back I remember XFM doing an "exposure" feature on  Marquee Moon , the three tracks they picked for the viewers selection were Marquee Moon, Venus and Torn Curtain. Venus won, though my own personal suspicion was it was rigged: I thought Marquee Moon should have triumphed, but at 10:47 it would have been far from a commercial radio station's normal choice.  At any rate my own personal favourite from the album is Prove It. Verlaine's (the lead singer) lyrics here are at their best and I find the snarling challenge: "Prove It" to be one of the most appealing moments on the album. The interplay between the guitarsis as solid andsimple here as it is on the rest ofthe album. That's what makes the album so special, in my opinion; the way the fantastic economy of the band works in conjunction with Verlaine's beautifully simplistic songwriting. Without a doubt Marquee Moon should be classed as one of the greatest and most innovative punk records ever.  The band went on to make two more albums:  Adventure  (1978) and  Television  (1992) though sadly neither of them really lived up to the impossibly high standard set by their debut. The band are still performing in their original form (I think) and were ironically featured in one of this year's major festival's- I think it was Glastonbury's -"New Bands" tent.     urlLink [Buy Television -  Marquee Moon  from Amazon.co.uk]
