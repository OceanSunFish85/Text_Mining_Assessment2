       For many years there has been a debate in football over   urlLink  grass    vs.   urlLink  turf   . Which is better to play on. They both have good and bad reasons why to use them. For instance, Turf you can run faster and you never have to mow it. It's consistant cause its all man made. But more injuries can occure on turf. So then grass you don't get as many injuries, its safer for the players. but you can't run as fast on it and it takes a lot of maintanence to keep it nice and consistant. And now they have this new hybrid of turf that is like grass but is a turf type material. Weird. So anyway different players prefer different things.  Well This week we found out what   urlLink  Ricky Williams    preference was. He prefers the grass. He prefers the grass over turf so much he quit playing profesional football at the peak of his career. He is giving up 8 million dollars because he prefers the grass. But the grass he prefers is   urlLink  Marijuana   . Yes that is correct. Ricky Williams has given up football because he likes Marijuana too much. After failing his third drug test by the NFL he decided to retire because he is tired of living by the strict rules of the NFL. In an article on   urlLink  ESPN.com    he talkes about how he's always got away with it because of a supplement drink he would take that could cover it up. So he's pretty much admitting he uses Marijuana on a regualar basis. Hmm. Wait one second. Isn't Marijuana illegal. Shouldn't the police be paying attention to this. Why isn't he being dealt with? Seriously. I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. He has already admitted to it. Where is the law. Why aren't we dealing with this problem.   urlLink  Dwight Gooden    and   urlLink  Darryl Strawberry     both went to jail when they were caught. Why isn't Ricky going to jail or something. Is it because his hair made him look Jamacian so its ok. Maybe thats why he shaved his head so that the police wouldn't recognize him and now they can't arrest him. Seriously. am i crazy? What's your thoughts? do you even care?

      Well this is my first time messing with "blogs". So i have no idea what i'm really doing. But i figure even I every now and then have something to say.The reasonthe name of my blog is Denver's thoughts is becausemy middle name is Denver andI have always wanted thatto be my first name.In fact i changed my name to Denver for a while but that's another story. I may not be very deep in thought or use fancy words as some may. For example you'll never hear me say words like "lackluster","debacle", or "juiced up". But hopefully i'll have something to say every now and then, especially once football season starts and my Denver Broncos are undefeated and the Colorado Buffaloes have surprised everyone by overcomming controversy and winning the national championship. You won't however hear me talking about politics or "important" matters. I just never can get any interest in that kind of stuff. Anyway I hope you enjoy reading what i have to say, if you don't then STOP READING IT!!! Its not going to hurt my feelings.

      Well itâs been a few days since my last post. Iâve been busy. Not really much time to write out anything to put on here. Plus I just havenât had any good stories to tell. But as I sit here today Iâve been doing a lot of thinking about life. Somethingâs not right. Iâve decided itâs because I need something new in my life. Some change.  I havenât figured out what change that is. Over the past week Iâve considered buying a big screen T.V., buying an old beat up truck, taking a big trip, growing my hair out for a year, going back to school to get a new degree, and the list just goes on and on. I still canât figure it out. But one thing Iâve decided Iâm doing is skydiving. Yes, I am going skydiving. There isnât anything more exciting, crazy, and new like skydiving. Can you imagine jumping from a plane at 10,000 feet and falling to the earth with nothing but a piece of nylon and string to keep you from dying. Who wants to go with me?  Ok, as I write this Iâm thinking to myself, am I going through my mid-life crisis? Is that why Iâm constantly wanting to do something new and exciting. Or have I been listening to the new Tim McGraw song âlive like you were dyingâ. Either way itâs got me in the mood for some skydiving. If this is my mid-life crisis does that mean Iâm only going to live to be 46? If so I better get moving on getting everything done that I want to do before I die. Then again I may not live to see 24. Maybe Iâll just start living every day like I was dying. Whatâs the one thing you would do if there was no tomorrow? Whatâs keeping you from doing it? I know if there was no tomorrow for me that I would make sure that Iâm enjoying every moment. I wouldnât worry about relationships, money, what other people are thinking, and many other things we worry about day to day.  So if youâre having the same feelings that I am about not worrying about tomorrow and you want to do something crazy come join me for some skydiving. After we are finished with that we can go find something else new to do.

       urlLink    Soccer   Last night we had our first soccer game of the season. It was the first time weâve played in a while. Most of use were out of shape, but we didnât let it keep us from winning. We won 9-4. Beau only scored 7 goals. Gambill scored 1 after missing two easy ones in the first half. I also scored 1 in the second half after having a few good shots not go in. Overall we looked pretty good. Rosey, Jamie, Tracy and Anastasia played a good game. If you havenât made it to one of our games you should come watch us. We play at Hat Trick arena on 122nd St. Our team name is officially Rhombus, but unofficially we are known as the Cochran Family. Anastasia and Rosey decided to surprise us with their custom team shirts that say âThe Cochran Familyâ on the front and a phone number on the back. We all plan on having our own custom shirts eventually. Mine will say G-unit, Beauâs will say Metro Beau, and so on. Any way as soon as I get a schedule Iâll post it on here so you can know when we are playing. Come support us. We promise it will be worth your time.

      Well many of you have either read our blogs or have heard us talk about getting Juiced Up. And many of you have heard us refer to some of the people there as names weâve given them. Like Starbucks Sara, and Smoky Smokerson, and White Hat Guy, and Starbucks girl. Well Starbucks girl is who Iâm going to be talking about today.  After our first few times of getting Juiced Up we started noticing that there was this girl that was always there. She seemed to show up at the same time every night. So we called her Starbucks girl. Sheâs kinda a mysterious girl. She always parks on the other side of the parking lot, and she always wears sweaters (in the summer time I might add). Well after a few times of seeing her there Rosey and Cochran get the idea that I need to go talk to her. Well word starts to spread about her in our group and suddenly we have 10-15 people showing up to Starbucks to see if Iâm going to go talk to Starbucks girl.  So after about three or four days of her not showing up everyone seemed to give up, which is good cause it was getting blown way out of proportion. So finally last night we decided to take a break from getting Juiced Up. After soccer we decided to call it a night. Well being addicted to coffee as I am I still decided to go by myself. So I get there around 10:15 and I decide to stay there and read for a while to see if Starbucks girl happened to show. So around 10:30 (her usual time to get there) there was no one there. Starbucks Sara came over to my table to talk to me, and said well I guess sheâs not showing again today. Yes thatâs how blown out of proportion this is. The Starbucks employees are looking for her.  So about 10:50 it happens, Starbucks girl shows up. So she gets her coffee and goes to her normal seat. So I figure hereâs my chance. So I go over to where sheâs sitting and notice sheâs reading the Bible. So I use that as my way to strike up a conversation. And so finally I find out that Starbucks girl has a name, Leslie. She goes to school at Oklahoma City University, sheâs a music/business major for now, and she goes to church at Bridgeway. I found out more but I donât want to bore you. And as we left she said sheâs there a lot so sheâll probably see me around. So itâs finally been done. You can stop all the talk about Starbucks Girl. But still come get Juiced Up with us. Maybe you can meet Leslie while youâre there.

      Ok sometimes I think I live an ordinary life, but then nights like tonight happen. To begin I would like to state that none of this story is embellished or made up. This is exactly how it happened.  It started as an ordinary Tuesday night. I went to bible study. Then I went to Starbucks to get Juiced Up (see previous entry). Finally around midnight I get home. I turn on my computer to see if anyoneâs online and to my surprise there is. So as I am getting ready to talk to some people my door bell rings. So Iâm a little hesitant to go to the door this late at night. So I take a golf club with me and look through the peep hole and as I do there is a loud bang on the door at the same time scaring me half to death. I open the door and itâs the neighbor (the wife, which is important later on). She seems to be scared from something so I ask her whatâs wrong. She told me that there were tornados on the way and they needed in my shelter. So I tell her ok, let me go get the gate unlocked and weâll go to the shelter. She tells me sheâs going to get her kids and stuff. So I decide to wake up my brother who is staying at my house tonight. I tell him about the golf ball size hail and tell him to move his car in the garage.  So we go out to move his car into the garage and he looks over at the side of the house weird. But doesnât say anything and moves his car in and goes back to sleep. So I go to the side of the house where I see three little girls crying and running towards my shelter. Then I look down and there is the neighbor lady laying on the ground not moving. So I shake her and she doesnât seem to be awake. And that is when I notice the smell of alcohol on her. She was blitzed. So I drag her towards the shelter with her heavy bag. When we get to the shelter she comes to. So I walk her down the stairs and tell her to wait down there while I go and check the tv out to see where the storms where.  So I turn on the tv to see what Mike Morgan has to say and to call Rosey, who I knew was just getting home from the juiced up session, to see what I should do. Rosey tells me to leave them down there and check up on them from time to time. So after Mike tells me that there are no actual tornados on the ground and its just high winds I decide to go and relay the message to the people in my shelter. I get down there and the girls are still in tears and keep saying theyâre going to die. So I informed them that everything was going to be fine and there were no tornados and they could stay down there if they wanted or they can head back home. So their mom tells them to go back to the house. And she then ask me to help her with her bag. So as Iâm zipping up her bag I noticed she had a gun in there that she has left over from when she was on the police force. So alcohol and guns. They donât mix. So I grab her bag and tell her to go ahead and Iâll shut the shelter.  So I get out of the shelter and sheâs waiting for me at the top. I close up the shelter and start walking to the front of the house and all of a sudden I feel her grab my butt!!! I panic and just start walking faster. As we turn the corner to go to her house she falls so I help her up and help her to her door. She invites me in her house with her. So I tell her that I have to get back to my house. Thatâs when she tells me how thankful she is that I was there to help in this great emergency and she then leans in for a kiss!!! So I quickly shut the door before she gets near me and come straight back to my house and lock the doors. Now Iâm sitting here in disbelief that it all happened. But Iâm writing this on my blog because I may later convince myself it didnât happen.  Sometimes its better to have a boring same thing every day life. But I guess this way I always have an exciting story to tell. I hope you believe this story cause it really happened. I will never open my door again when there is a storm outside.

       urlLink    Starbucks   What does it mean to get Juiced Up?  Is it something anyone can do?  Is it really all the hype that people make it?  I intend to answer these questions.    You may or may not have heard the term Juiced Up.  If you have, then youâve been given the opportunity to experience one of the great venues that  urlLink Edmond  has to offer.  First I would like to take a moment and dissect this word Juiced Up.  What does it mean?  Websterâs dictionary describes it like this:    urlLink Juiced  â 1. to add juice to               2. to extract the juice of    urlLink Up  â 1. with greater intensity          2. in or into a better or more advanced state (the word up actually has many more definitions, but these are the ones I liked the best)   Apart these are merely words with little meaning.  But put them together and you get an experience unlike any other, Juiced Up.    It all started on July 25 th a Sunday night like any other when Cochran made the statement âI need to go get Juiced Upâ.   We didnât know what to think.  He himself felt embarrassed for making such a comment.  What he meant was that he simply wanted to go to  urlLink Starbucks  to get some coffee.  None of us in the beginning would have ever thought that phrase would ever return in conversation.  But man were we wrong.   Now here we are August 9, 2004 and we have been getting Juiced Up ever since.  We have successfully gone to get Juiced Up 6 times in the past 2 weeks.  Now you may think youâve partaken in the Juiced Up activities, but you would be wrong.  Itâs not simply going to Starbucks.  You must have at least a majority of the charter members present, which includes Cochran, Rosey, and myself, and the only rule is: what is said there stays there.    You may ask why they go so often.  Maybe itâs they have nothing better to do (Cochran).  Or maybe they are addicted to the coffee (Rosey).  Or maybe they are trying to find the right time to go and talk to the girl with glasses that always seems to be there wearing a sweater in the middle of summer (Me).  No, that can not be it; we simply come together for a greater purpose, to get Juiced Up.  Getting Juiced Up is not just an activity we participate in; itâs a way of life.

       urlLink    My Office   Well, this is my office. Thereâs not much to it. But it does have four walls and a door that I can shut when my stupid secretary is annoying me to death. As you can see I have a pile of work currently on my desk. Yes I still havenât done that work. Its been sitting there for some time this week. So anyway this is where I spend half of my life. I donât know whatâs so cool about it. Actually there isnât anything cool about it. Iâm currently looking for a job that doesnât put me in an office and still pays the same. But I donât see that happening. For some reason manual labor doesnât pay well. But if you sit in an air conditioned office then you get paid more. Makes no sense to me. But I still like my job even though I have an office. For example today I got tired of working so I took off after lunch and went to play golf. You canât argue with that. Free golf and I can make my own hours. It is a pretty nice set up I have. And the entry below this one shows the view out of my window. Not exciting.

       urlLink    View    Yes, this is the view out of my window as of 7/5/04. Iâm very upset with this. On the other side of that fence is the golf course. I used to have an office that overlooked the golf course. Then all of a sudden they go and put up this 9 feet tall fence. Now all I can see is the fence and the ugly hill. What am I supposed to look at while Iâm not working. Nothing. This has ruined it all for me. Although now that I canât see the golf course itâs probably for the better cause before I would sit there and stare at the golf course wishing I was playing. Now that I canât see it I no longer sit and stare at it wishing I could play. Now I just go out there and actually play instead of wishing I could. But I still think I deserve a better view than a big tall fence. Maybe if they could paint a picture on the fence or something. I donât know. Oh well, I guess Iâll have to focus more on my work now. It was good while it lasted.

       urlLink    That actually isn't me in the picture   Well today was a long day, this is the first time Iâve been home all day and its already 11:30. I went straight from  urlLink work  to  urlLink church  to playing  urlLink tennis  to  urlLink running . That will wear you out. The first part of my day there isnât much to talk about. I went to work, I went to church. But then after church I went to play tennis with the wonderful Lindsy Graham.  Before I tell this story let me remind you that in high school Lindsy played tennis and I didnât. I spent my days on the golf course which by the way has earned me more money and gotten me further in life than tennis ever would. So any way we go out to play tennis. This is the first time Iâve played in 2 years so needless to say I was a little rusty. We play the first 12 games and we end in a 6 to 6 tie. We were pretty evenly matched (remember she used to play in high school). Then she won the tie break. Then we were getting tired so we played the next set to four. And since Iâm getting so out of shape she beat me pretty bad. Thatâs right, I got beat by a  urlLink girl . Just donât let her know I let her win.  So after being embarrassed I had the privilege to go run 1.5 miles. Normally that wouldnât be a problem but I just finished playing tennis for the past 2 hours. I was tired. If you were curious as to why I had to run its because miss Katie Allen has me on a run program that she is gradually working on getting me to where I can run in an actual 5k race. I have a long ways to go but Iâm going to give it a try anyway.  So the moral of this story is I was embarrassed by losing to a girl, but I will get my revenge. And anyone that thinks its funny that I got beat by a girl, I bet she would beat you too.

       urlLink    Hole #1 at  urlLink Rose Creek     Well I finally got to play  urlLink golf  again. I finally have found some time to play for the first time in 2 months. Normally taking 2 months off from golf would be bad for your golf game. But surprisingly I played very good. Golf is a game that never ceases to amaze me. If youâve never played it before you should try taking it up sometime. Itâs a game that you can play even as you get old, and you donâ t have to be good at it to have fun. But donât expect me to play with you if you havenât played before. I donât have much patience with beginners.  When I got home from the golf course I turned on the TV while I cooked dinner. I normally donât watch TV but I made an exception since I was trying to rest from playing golf. The TV show â urlLink Everybody Loves Raymond â was on. Iâve heard good things about it so I watched it. And it just happened to be an episode where the wife wanted Raymond to take her golfing so they can do more together. And that brings us to our topic of discussion.  I will never get married to someone that plays golf. The golf course is to be my place to go, not my wifeâs. The golf course is where I will be going to get away from my wife. A place to be on my own away from her. You need times apart. Just like in relationships now, you canât spend all your time with the same person. Youâll go crazy if you do. And it will in the long run end with a bad relationship. But like in the TV show, youâll see that when husbands and wives get too annoyed with each other on the golf course. Golf is already a stressful enough sport. When you add the stress of a women to it then it becomes too much. It can only do harm to your relationship. Of course this is coming from me who plans on having a separate house for my wife. But thatâs another story for another day.

      Ok, so apparently I tried to type my last blog in a yellow font to get the black and gold look that would match the Colorado Buffaloes colors. And I apparently wasnât grammatically correct because I didnât type it in a word document before I posted it. I apologize for my mistakes. But in my defense Iâm still new to this thing. I still havenât learned how to post pictures. Sorry but I do have a life outside this cyber world. But I did learn tonight how to link my friends blogs to my blog (Thanks Gambil). And this got me thinking, if I connect just one person to my blog then my blog could possibly be connected to just about any blog in the world. Think about it. Iâm connected to a blog and that blog has 5 friends connected who all have 5 other friends connected. So pretty much its all connected through blogs. Pretty soon youâll be able to play that 6 degrees game that you play with movies. For example we'll be sitting around quizzing each other. âok I can connect Troy Townsend to Hank Torn in under three people. Troyâs blog is linked to Cochranâs blog who is linked to Hankâs blog.â Its like that Kevin Bacon game but only more gay. Whatâs this world coming to? Why am I writing about this? Why am I this tired this early in the night? Especially after i went to Starbucks to get âjuiced upâ. Well let me know if you agree with my connected blog theory. Its pretty deep I know. I think Iâm going to watch Dumb and Dumber now.

       urlLink    Well tonight I had the oportunity to take in a film that I'd been looking quite forward to for some time. M. Night Shyamalan's  urlLink  The Village   has been adverstised for some time and according to the previews you'd expect one of the scariest movies of all time. However, if you've watched any of Mr. Shyamalan's films in the past you would know that you are not going to get exactly what you think you'll get--and this film is no different.   The Village  is set in what appears to be a 19th centrury American village along the edge of some very foreboding woods. We learn early on that the people of this village live a peacful life, yet it's a life full of constant reminders that their lives are always in danger due to the "things we cannot speak of" that live in the woods. The villagers are never supposed to leave their village or cross the boundary into the woods for fear that the creatures will come and attack them. As the story unfolds we learn of Lucious (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who wants to travel through the woods in order to find the towns where they can buy medical supplies in order to help the sick people in the village.  Lucious believes that the creatures know he only has good intentions and therefore will do him no harm. As time passes and his desires to help his fellow villagers increase, he dares to actually cross into their forrest one day only to find out that his actions have repurcussions. "Those we do not speak of" then decide to warn the village to cease this by then crossing over into the village for the first time in many years in order to warn the villages of their error. This forces all the villagers to seek shelter and really stay on their guards at all times. Meanwhile Lucious is falling in love with Ivy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who is blind but is also very insightful. They decide to marry and announce it to the villagers, but this decision turns out to have disastrous consequences and forces the village to decide if it's worth the risk to seek out the towns for help. Ultimately it is up to Ivy to go, despite her blindness, and seek help.  This is a typical Shymalan film, so you can expect the normal twists and turns and of course not everything as it appears. Just like  Signs  or  The Sixth Sense  we see many other themes underlying the main plot. We can see the references to human nature as a whole to want to do the forbidden despite knowing that it has consequences. We also see the idea that fear within a society can control the minds of the people but only for so long. Eventually individuals will need to test the boundaries even though they may be uncertain of the consequences. There are many other ideas that permeate this work, and I just need a little more time to think about it to come up with them as it's late and I'm sleepy..  Overall I would give  The Village  good marks. It wasn't quite as gripping as Shyamalan's previous works and it was slow at times but the overall themes were good. There were some scenes that seemed to be distracting to me due to the camera work and some of the acting was suspect but I thought that Phoenix did a good job as did William Hurt and Howard. I would recommend seeing this if you are a fan of Shyamalan's work or if you like movies that provoke thought. If you're just looking for a horror flick then I'd recommend staying away. Overall I'd give it about a 6.5 out of 10.   urlLink

       urlLink    Grandpa Jones urlLink     The other day, I had a some one say to me, "you're a cool guy." I thought about it and realized that in actually, I'm not that cool of a guy. I mean, "you're a cool guy" is a great compliment, but perhaps my standards of cool are set fairly high. I mean it takes a special person to merit such an adjective as cool. I don't know about you but I don't like to just throw titles like that around loosely. The reason for this is simple, those who I look to for coolness, hold that title to very high standards. Probably the coolest cat of all is the famous Grandpa Jones. I mean it's hard to find anyone that's cooler than Grandpa Jones. He was the unnamed member of the Rat Pack, the original choice for James Bond before Connery, and had more dates than Hugh Hefner. Grandpa Jones is my hero. Of course, I am nothing like Grandpa Jones. I don't have his good looks, charisma or even self esteem. But I can dream can't I? So I even though I enjoy being called "cool". I know it takes more than justa title to help me reach that level of sophistication.

       urlLink    The Amazing Race urlLink       The Amazing Race is my new favorite TV show. I absolutely love it! If youâve been living under a rock this summer and havenât heard of the Amazing Race youâre missing out! Here are my top 10 reasons why I like the show and why you should be watching it!   10. Itâs the only reality show that has an Emmyâ¦yes folks it beat out Survivor!  9. What other reality show can you watch where teams are going to different locations each week. Every Tuesday night I feel like I get a free vacation.  8. CBS picks the best teams to watch. This year we have a Christian dating couple, an internet older dating couple, father daughter , husband wife, bowling moms, brothers, twins, 2 other dating couples, once engaged, and my favorite the cousins. Usually you can pick one team that you are really rooting for.  7. The host! Alright ladies Phil is no Jeff Probst (Survivor Host) but heâs pretty dang close. Unlike Jeff, Phil really doesnât talk , which I like. Sometimes during Survivor I get so sick of hearing Jeff voice his opinion. WHO CARES is always what Iâm thinking. With Phil you donât have to worry about that because he doesnât talk! I like that! 6. The Fights! Each team has chosen their partner so they know each other pretty well! Nothing is better than watching partners get in a fight and then still having to be stuck with each other. Itâs great!  5. Wednesdayâ¦yes Wednesday! Wednesday is the day my good friend Teresa and I discuss the show. We have some great discussions on our opinion about the show. Sometimes these discussions last most of the day, hey helps me get through the work day!  4. More fights! These teams not only fight with each other they also fight with the other teams. This week one team didnât like another team so they bought the remanding airplane tickets so that team couldnât get on the planeâ¦.harsh!  3. Stupid people that make the show. Youâd be surprised how many DUMB people make it on the show. The brothers teamsâ¦ they like to yell at the foreigners because they think that helps them understand English!  2. The fact that this is the only show that I seriously sit in front of the TV and yell at the teams like they can hear me! Sad as that isâ¦ Iâm not joking!  1. Charla! I love her! Sheâs with her cousin Mirna. Charla is a little person (FYI little people do not like to be called dwarfs or midgets). She has seriously gone farther than I or American thought she would go. Just look at her, how could that not be enjoyable to watch!   Alright I hope Iâve convinced everyone to tune in next week! It comes on every Tuesday, 9:00 pm CBS. Happy tubing!

       urlLink    Enie van de Meiklokjes  This is Enie. One of my favorite German TV personalities. She may have pink/redish hair, but somehow it looks natural. I think she's cute, fun, and very talented. She has hosted many different television programs as well as done some commercials. She has also done some acting on TV and in a few movies. She has even found the time to record a few singles for the radio.  Personally I just thought I would share something unique( and not a bit scary to you I'm sure) with you as I seem to have nothing new to write. And also because I had Mgam tell me how to post pictures on my blog urlLink

      In my opinion, Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made. I realize that the American Film Institute rates Citizen Kane as the number 1 movie of all time, however I still contend that Casablanca should be number 1.   Having said that, in the future I will probably start picking random movies to review. Some just to let people know about them. Other movies I will talk about them because they are favorites. I'm not educated in the entire world of film making, but I'm a fan of movies and I love to talk about my hobbies.   So my first recommendation is in theatres now. I highly recommend seeing The Bourne Supremacy. For fans of the Bourne Identity, you won't be disappointed. This chapter in the series of Bourne stories Jason Bourne is forced to clear his name after an international criminal frames Bourne for a crime he didn't committ. He comes to face past demons and more insights into his true identity. This film is full ofthe samegreat action sequences and locations that made the first film good as well.

      I love to analyze thing, actually just about everything! I mean I love movies and music, but when it comes down to it, I will review anything. I love to laugh, but I will always enjoy the intellectual as well. I would love to tell you that I have deep thoughts, but like most people, I live in the superfical. So that's what I will talk about.

        My First Juiced-Up Experience!  So last night I went and got âjuiced upâ. I have to say this is my first time and I found that I was alittle lost.  I mean good grief they have nicknames for the Starbucks staff. As I was sitting back and listening to everyone talk I decided that maybe I should share what I learned last night, that way you wonât be so lost when you go and get âjuiced upâ.  Since Iâm real good with list I thought a top 10 list would be appropriate. Remember this is all stuff that I learned last night while sitting at Starbucks for an hour and half with these people.   10. Thereâs a girl staff and guy staff. Last night we had the girl staff plus one guy. 9.   There seems to be two favorite Starbucks employees among the group. First thereâs Starbucks Sarah and then thereâs Smokie Smokerson. I had the pleasure of seeing both girls last night. 8. Smokie Smokerson seemed nice and looks pretty normal. She got the nickname because every time she has a break sheâs always looking for an ash tray. I was also told she has a boyfriend that picks her up from work and he wears a white hateâ¦they like to call him White Hat Guy. Grant described the hat as a beret type hat, but not! (whatever that means) 7. Starbucks Sarah is the gothic looking girl. She actually talked to us while she was taking down the umbrellas and seemed pretty nice. I think she also gave Ken a drink on the house. We tried to get Ken to go flirt with her but he wouldnât. 6. Stalkersâ¦ as I sat there last night I realized that I was with a bunch of stalkers. They all know so much about the people that regularly visit Starbucks and they really donât talk to themâ¦.I was getting alittle worried and creeped out at the same time. 6. Grantâs Girl. She did NOT show up to Starbucks last night!  If you donât know Grant thinks this girl that wears glasses and a sweater is kinda cute. I do want to add that Grant is NOT stalking the girlâ¦.Rosey is. Rosey knows everything about herâ¦well ok not everything, but she sure knows alot for never talking to her. 5. This group goes to Starbucks way too much! When Grantâs order was ready they said âGrant your orders ready.â  That was the big time for this group! 4. Starbucks gives free water. I know thatâs not interesting but hey itâs good info to know! 3. Grantâs Girl again. I just would like to add that this group knows what time she normally visits Starbucks. I told you itâs creepy. Oh itâs 10:30pm if youâre wondering! 2. Slap bracelets are back in style. Remember those? Yeah theyâre back so go get one! 1. When Grant was a kid he liked to dress up like Michael Jackson! Iâm serious!!!!!!! He had the red leather jacket and everythingâ¦.he even had the glove! Are you laughing as hard as I am now?  So over all the night was a lot of fun. I would rate the night as 8 or 9, only because it took me a few minutes to figure everything out. I highly recommend you go and get âjuiced upâ.
