      My past week has consisted of long days of work, long nights of the democratic convention, and the occasional drink to make both of the aforementioned seem less painful. Some brief excerpts from mental wanderings during those events:  Even at the democratic convention Michael Moore refuses to lose the hat - how bad can his hair possibly be?  Whoever said, "there is no such thing as a free lunch" had obviously never worked at any sort of corporate firm. The art of scheduling meetings with anyone your senior immediately prior to lunch is highly underrated.  A topic discussed recently somewhere between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning (at Snake  Jakes in New Orleans no less), and rekindled by Guapo's post: Is "redneck" a derogatory term? Can you refer to certain inanimate objects, such as a shotgun or wifebeater, as inherantly redneck without being offensive? If you refer directly to a person as a redneck is it offensive? Submit all arguments to me by close of business Friday and I will return a ruling by Monday.  In the above I blatantly spelled out "close of business" for those of you who are not 'in the know'. I spent the first month of my summer clerkship receiving emails containing the letters, "COB" or "C.O.B.". However, I refused to ask what the term meant until one of the attorneys sent an email, presumably because he was once in my shoes, with the term defined: "and for the motion to be filed before COB (close of business) on Wednesday." Now, you are all part of this little COB circle of trust.  And now, the presumptive democratic nominee for president...Ben Affleck. No, wait, who is the nominee again? I'm confused, because in the first three days of convention coverage I've seen Kerry signs everywhere, but it seems like whenever a camera is filming, or an interview is being conducted, that the obviously knowledgeable half of the now defunct Bennifer finds a way to get himself involved. I say trade him back to Celebrity Poker on Bravo in exchange for the entire cast of the West Wing and a player to be named later.  Though it goes against my normal writing style, I'm actually going to segue here. On ESPN yesterday afternoon the bottom portion of the screen was filled for several hours with a second-by-second countdown to the newest episode of the World Poker Tour. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm as big a fan of poker on television as the next person. But, far more significant television events have happened in recent history, and all have been successful without a full day, second-by-second countdown. I guess I'm not one to say that the final episode of Friends couldn't have picked up a few more viewers if NBC had thrown a week long countdown on there.  And with that, I return to an extended afternoon of pokerroom.com, merely biding my time between my free lunch, and the free summer clerk dinner and drinks tonight.  Damn it feels good to be a gangster.

      On Sunday, Ricky Williams abruptly retired from the National Football League. You might remember that Ricky was perhaps the greatest running back in college football history at Texas, then went to the Saints, and finally on to the Dolphins, where he became an all-pro and led the NFL in rushing yards in 2002. He had reached the pinnacle of his chosen career, made roughly $16 million for 5 years of work, and decided that he was tired of the interviews, the pressure to keep a specific weight, the constant drug testing and the thought of spending 10 more years getting decked by 350-poundlinemen and probably permanently injuring himself. He called his coach, told him he was retiring and hopped on a one way flight to Asia, probably not to be heard from again fora few months.   So what is the reaction of the sporting world? Phrases like "always a little odd", "off-the-wall decision"and "crazy" litter ESPN.com and CNNSI.com this morning. Apparently the 40-50 year old men who sit in front of computers writing articles or spend all day training grown men to maul each other think that Ricky has made a flawed decision. Maybe they've never seen Office Space, or maybe they're from a generation when trudging through life going to a job you don't particularly love is a noble feat. To my generation, the question is "If you had a million dollars, what would you do?" And though the question is flawed because we'd have no janitors, it is not just an abstract hypothetical for Ricky Williams.   Ricky Williams has more money than he will ever need in this lifetime. He has been the single most dominant performer in his profession at age 25. He decided that waking up early to go to football practice all day, every day is not how he wants to spend his life, and he had the guts to go against societal norms and leave it all behind. This man is now my hero. He will get to see the world. He can eat the food, meet the people, or as the country song goes, he can"go sky-diving, Rocky Mountain Clmbing, and go2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu." Who hasn't dreamed of that?   I know alot of people who like their chosen career path. My friends are now experiencing the lives of professionals, and many of us have chosen the ideal jobs for our natural skills and abilities, and we're becoming proficient in our crafts, and get a feeling of accomplishment after a hard day of work. However, none of us if given the choice, and no financial limitations would be an attorney 5 days a week. Simply put, work is not as fun as anything besides work. You can find a job that makes you happy and helps you make it through 5 days of forced labor, but in the end, it is forced labor, and nobody would choose that, all else being equal.   We all need some sort of professional accomplishment to feel fully fulfilled. It is one of the pieces of the life jigsaw puzzle that we all strive to finish. We want to be a success as a professional, as an ethical citizen, as an intellectual, as a member of a family, and as a participant in something we are passionate about. All too often however, people think that they can compensate for the others by being uber-successful as a professional. Ricky Williams settled for being a successful professional, and now has the chance to fill in the other pieces. He can study what interests him, help others, experience all the world can offer, be a loving father with infinite time for his children, and try out every possible hobby that has ever interested him. He has seen the big picture and now he is doing what we all dream of. And according to a sportswriter and former NFL executive, his retirement was just another "off-the-wall decision."   If in7 years (2 more of law school, 5 as a lawyer), I've made $16 million, and accomplished a ridiculous amount as an attorney (i.e. Supreme Court win), and have small children, I hope I have the courage that Ricky Williams had to walk away from it and pursue something else. I want to travel the world, jump out of an airplane, ride cross country in an RV Road Rules style, waste away afternoons drinking Abita at the C-Note, build a house, have time for a "little brother," and learn more about my family history and religion. I'd love to study philosphy, spend a month watching the Senate floor, learn how to play guitar, and even become a Northeastern prick by learning to play lacrosse. Right now, I'm not sure I'll have time to do these things for a while, and Ricky Williams didn't see the time for his dreams. So he quit his job and went after them. If that is an off-the-wall decision, I, along with Peter Gibbons, must be off-the-wall. Some of us dream of doing nothing, while others dream of smoking weed and traveling Asia. But no matter what your dream, I think we all should take a moment to admire Ricky Williams, my new favorite ex-football player.

      Sorry Justin. Even with my vast experience in finding obscure stuff on the Internet, I haven't been able to find 10 hot ethnic models.I have found onefrom the Phillipines,but I'm still working onsuch exotic locales such as Madgascar, Sri Lanka, and French Guyana. I might have to peruse through National Geographic pretty soon.I'm still working on it, believe me. I have a better subject to write a post. That's right, redneck weddings.  My friend Dusty is the cousin of my best friend from C-Bad, Bryan aka Kramer. It all came to a shock to us when he announced that he was engaged around March. He announced thatthe wedding was going to be in wonderful Denton,Tx. He just barely invited me to his wedding this past Thursday.I thought to myself,"Well, I'm gonna be a strange guy in a strange land this weekend." My fear was confirmed last night.  First is the drive up to Denton. It is about a 45 minute drive from my place in Dallas. The only thing that I could think about is the banjo riff from Deliverance as I drove through various country back roads in Denton.   I finally get to the church. The minute I step into the church, I immediately get the "What the hell are YOU doing here, boy?" look. It seems as if a lot of people have never seen an Asian kid outside of theChinese food delivery guy. Thank god I hear,"Hey James." It's my friend, Sarah, who isthe hot older sister of Cody Ross(outfielder for the Las Vegas 51s, the AAA affiliate for the LA Dodgers) and wife ofone of my brother's best friends from home. She was there with her son, Hunter, who is quite possibly the cutest kid you have ever seen. He starts screaming out,"AGE!". Obviously he's mistaken me for my brother. For no reason he starts slugging me with on my thigh.For a three year old, he's pretty strong. He couldn't stop slugginme. His mother tells him,"No, Hunter! You can do that to Age, but not to his brother." Soon more C-Bad peoplecame filing into the church and the ceremony takes place.One person who I see is my friend Annie, who Justin if you remember is my hotAngelina Jolie lookalike friend who Jordan tried so hard to hit on when both of you stayed with me in Carlsbad. I take my seat, and I notice the shirt of the guy who's sitting in front of me. Most people are dressed for the occasion with the exception of this guy in front of me. He stands up to say hi to someone and he's wearing, no joke, cowboy boots, Wranglers, and a sweet Hawaiian shirt with hula girls and pineapples on it. If that isn't Texas, then I don't know what is.  The ceremony was yourtypical Christian ceremony with a twinge of Southern Baptist thrown in there. It was quick andto the point. We all go over to the country club for the reception which couldn't start until 9:00 because everyone got lost to the country club. I immediately start drinking, being very careful not getting too drunk because itsone thingbeing in the middle of nowhere and not knowing your way around, but its another being drunk in the middle of nowhere and not knowing your way around. It was good drinking together with friends for the first time legally. I wasn't able to attend therehearsal dinner on Friday, so everyone was getting me up to speed. Apparently it was a fiasco because my friend Kramer got so drunk hetried to start a fight with every guy at the rehearsal dinner, from the father of the bride to the ex-boyfriend of thebride to his own grandfather to his own mother. The bride was crying, his mother was smoking menthols like it was her job. They were all telling me,"Neal, it was a sight to see." They then informed me that the morning after he was found in his underwear in the hallway of the hotel. I thought to myself,"Yup, that's Kramer for ya."  I was still getting the occassional weird foreigner look from various people at the reception. I was sitting by Jerry, the only other minority anda nice Mexican kid from Carlsbad. I speak to him in Spanish. I asked him,"Do you feel a little strange being here?" He replied back,"We are in an environment ripe for a hate crime right now."   Time passes by. My Carlsbad friends and I are drinking, having a good time. Werealize that people from the reception start heading for the door. It was pretty sad. Everyone from Carlsbad were still drinking, while everyone was heading out to the door probably to go to sleep so they could go to8AM mass the next morning. It was only 1030.They probably think we're all sinners and we're destined for helljust because we drink so much.   We finished drinking aroundmidnight, and I was sober enough to navigate the back roads of Denton back to Dallas.If you ever want to confirmany stereotypes thatyou may have about Texas, go to a wedding.You'll be in for quite an experience. Justin, believe me, I'm still working on a list of 10 hot ethnic models.   Living la vida without the loca,  Guapo

       The list is clearly in need of a re-do, for some, their time has passed. For others, what were we thinking? And for still others, I must again ask Guapo, who the hell is that? Also, as a reminder, girlfriends were not allowed for consideration, since you know, Guapo picking Mike's girlfriend might be awkward. Letâs review a few key choices and their reason for dropping off my list:  Jamie Pressley â My former #1. As soon as you date Kid Rock, you are tainted goods. See ya. Britney Spears â Iâm not saying I wouldnât want her to be my step-milf. But she married a serious Louisiana hillbilly, then started drinking and getting fat, and is now marrying a backup dancer. Ahh, Brit, I remember the days when you were cute and innocent and adorned my dorm room walls. Say it ainât so. Tara Reid â I would argue that Tara was Paris Hilton before Paris Hilton. Fake blond, in the news because she is a drunk party-girl, and complete ho. Now there is no denying her hotness in the final party scene of Van Wilder (Iâve never enjoyed a white bikini more), but come on Tara, get in the news for some career related event just once please. Jenny McCarthy â If this list was made in 1994, she is #1. But since all Iâve heard about her since 2002 was a book about pregnancy, I think itâs time to go. Jennifer Aniston - Friends is done and so is Rachel. It was nice knowing you. Anna K â I wonât argue the fact that her appeal was that she was a hot athlete, *not* that she is simply a hot person. Had she not been a tennis player, she is a nice looking Russian. No tennis, no list.  Since I have a little less free time than I did in the Summer of 2002, I will make my list only 10. (Canât I just pretend to be Student Body President as a full time job? I believe I spent more time playing Yahoo! Blackjack that summer than I did âworking.â On a side note, I finally got the balls to split 10âs against a weak dealer hand in Vegas, and though my dad nearly disowned me, I won both hands, just as I always did in that fateful summer online.)  I submit for your approval, my new and improved list. (In case it isnât painfully obvious, I like the young, girl next door brunette types. For the sake of my future need to pass the morals part of the bar, Iâve eliminated any girls under 18.):  Kate Beckinsale â Iâm not going to lie, I usually hate anything British, but Kate is rocking. She really became my flavor of the month in the completely overlooked film Laurel Canyon. A great flick if youâve missed it where she somehow plays the hot smart chick and the even hotter bi-curious chick in the same role. Just masterful acting - and stripping.  Keira Knightly â She burst into my life with an amazing performance of hottieness in Love Actually. Then I watched Bend it Like Beckham and pretended it wasnât her. Finally, she has settled in to full-blown hottie, and with years to go before she hits her prime. Iâm as excited about this as the Clippers are about watching Shaun Livingston develop.  Katie Holmes â Like a fine wine, she continues to get better with age. As an aside, is it creepy that I have 3 girls named Kate and one named Keira on the list?  Natalie Portman â I gotta give my props to the hottest Jew around. Natalie has developed from tomboy to cute teen, to full out hotness. She is Grade A-top choice meat, and more importantly, sheâs kosher.  Barbara Bush â It would appear as if W has done one thing right in his life. (This of course, is his daughter, not mother.) Umm, I think Jenna and Barbara are twins like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito were. How on earth did the hot one go to Yale and the not hot one go to UT? That defies the laws of college.  Jamie from the Real World San Diego â Hi, Iâm Jamie, Iâm only a ridiculously hot Asian girl with cameras following me around who inexplicably got no action in San Freaking Diego. What happened here? While all the housemates were fixated on Cameran, the mildly hot Southern bimbo, they ignored that perhaps the hottest Asian in the world was in their midst. Poorly played boys.  Katie Couric â I need to have one token milf on the list. Sheâs a UVA grad, and sheâs smoking. You know sheâs hot when I actually flip away from Sportscenter now occasionally in the mornings.  Jessica Simpson â Ok, despite her being retarded, so high maintenance that she might qualify as one of Mikeâs ex girlfriends, and having an unnatural orange color, there is no denying that she has emerged from the pop star 4 (Britney, Christina, Jessica, Mandy) as the only one with grown-up staying power as a hottie.  Amanda Bynes â This girl is perhaps the worst actress of all time, and yet she is finally 18, so nobody can say anything to me. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about placing her on the list is that when I looked up her age and saw 1986, I thought âdamn, too youngâ then realized people born in â86 are 18. When did we get so old? For a quick laugh, look up her credits on IMDB. This girl needs Hillary Duffâs agent.  Giada De Laurentiis â If you are a casual Food Network watcher, you are probably aware of Rachel Ray from $40 a day and 30 minute meals. But you must be a FoodTV junkie like me to have caught the show Everyday Italian, starring the decadent and delicious Ms. De Laurentiis. If you need proof that she exists, a simple google search ought to do it. Youâll thank me later.  There you go, my new top ten. Not the traditional hot girls (i.e. Pam Anderson), but itâs my blog, so I can pick whoever I want. I turn it over to the rest of you to come up with a stronger, more diverse 10. (Ok, if you consider 1 Asian and 1 woman over 30 diverse). Guapo, I expect a list of 10 random ethnic models that Iâve never heard of, donât disappoint. I have not ranked them in order yet, but will when the time comes that it is necessary for scoring.

      As voted on in the Summer of 2002 (before there were blogs to write on at your summer job) the 6319 crew held an official vote on the 20 hottest girls in the world. Each person was allowed 20 votes, with their first choice getting 20 votes, second choice getting 19 votes, continuing on down the list.   The results were as follows (and I only wish I could find my original personal list to show that my 20 have held the most true over time, and that my #1 was the most underrated and overlooked on the entire list - sorry Charlize):  #1	Jamie Pressly  (58 votes) #2	Britney Spears  (46 votes) #3 	Katie Holmes  (43 votes) #4	Heidi Klum  (38 votes) #5	Tara Reid  (33 votes) #6 	Brooke Burke  (32 votes) #7 	Alyssa Milano  (29 votes) #8 	Jessica Simpson  (27 votes) #8	Jenny McCarthy  (27 votes) #10	Jennifer Aniston  (26 votes) #11	Eliza Dushku  (24 votes) #12	Yasmine Bleeth  (22 votes) #13	Charlize Theron  (20 votes) #13	Elizabeth Hurley  (20 votes) #13	Selma Hayek  (20 votes) #16	Kim Smith  (19 votes) #16	Sarah Michelle Gellar  (19 votes) #18	Anna Kournakova  (18 votes) #18 	Laetitia Costa  (18 votes) #20	Tiffany Theissen  (17 votes) #20	Kelly Ripa  (17 votes) #20	Yamila Diaz-Rahi  (17 votes)  Discuss...

      While we're discussing the worst-run companies in America we cannot forget about my favorite - U-Haul. First, let's establish that they have a monopoly on the services that they offer. One-way, out-of-citymoves, and trailers are onlyavailable throughthese guys. So here's how it works. You call to reserve a truck and for your forethought, preparation and organization they end the conversation with ok, we'll call you the day before your reservation to let you know the time you can pick up the truck, where you can pick up the truck and whatsize of truck you can have. That's right. They'll call you.So let's summarize,I've reserved something, at some time, andI can pick it up somewhere, and I'll sit around for you to fill me in on the details less than 24 hours before my move.Hey, thanks for the reservation.    Now I know the creative thinkers at U-haul were saying to themselves, how can we streamline this process? It just seems like taking reservations all around the country and coordinating them seems like quite a hassle, so how can we just ignore the process without keeping customers away? Ahh, the "call-back." They'll call you by 5 pm, the day before your reservation. And coincidentally, the offices all close at 5 pm. Hmm, 5:05, no call. 5:10, 5:15. Maybe I should call them to find out where and when to go to the U-haul. Ring-Ring. What the? They're closed!?!? Now what do I do? And, bam, they have you.    But here's what separates U-Haul from other incompetent institutions like Public Storage, Verizon Wireless and any company headquartered in New Orleans: Ford Explorer discrimination. That's right, after spending $200 last summer to buy and install a hitch on the back of my Explorer, U-Haul decided this year that Ford Explorers and ony Ford Explorers can no longer rent trailers. No other vehicle, even those that are the exact same model and have the same exact body with a different name, is prohibited.If someone can explain this genius tome, let me know. In the meantime I'll try not to move until some competition pops up. U-Haul, U-Suck and you go on the boycott list. So here we have it:  1. United Airlines, 2. American Airlines, 3. Madigans, 4.Verizon Wireless, 5, Public Storage, and 6. U-Haul.    Here's a few not funny observations:    Someone needs to explain to girls at the gym that when you wear shorts that barely cover your cheeks to the gym, with "Sweet" written across the back, you might just get some guys staring at your ass on the stairmaster in between sets, so keep the dirty looks to yourself or don't wear the shorts. And memo to fat, hairysweaty guys - the disinfectant spray and hand towels are not just a suggestion. Finally, can someone tell the Eastern European girls that pink bike shorts, black socks and yellow tennis shoes have somehow gone out of style.    I'm pretty sure that the three computer players (you know who you are Pauline, Michelle and Ben)are ganging up on me whenI play hearts. Either that or they're looking at my cards.    Greatest thing about Charlottesville in two words: Bacon Pancakes. Imean seriously, where is the rest of the country on this one? I'm letting the secret out. Ain't nothing wrong with pancakes or bacon, but shove those two together and the party never stops.    So I was out with some law school buddies and we sit at a table in a bar and peer over to see roughly ten people leaning all over the table and getting progressively louder and happier. Upon closer inspection we find out they all have straws leading to a clam shaped bowl filled with some drink only referred to as "the walrus." They implored us to try on because "this thing is the best, it will get you wasted, it's awesome." It was at this point that I madea startling revelation -I'm finally beyond the age where giant drinks in clam shaped containers called "the walrus" are appealing. I could feel the frattiness slowly dying inside of me.   Can VH1 stop with the I Love the 90's. It was like 5 years ago, and you have the people involved in the stories making fun of them. I saw a grown up Hanson (scary enough) analyzing the impact of MMMbop. You mean Hanson was available to make an apperance? Who would've guessed? And who the hell are these "celebrities" commenting? Is doing these shows a new career opportunity for aspiring comedians? And if so, is this a step up or down from Hollywood Squares? I need to know. So after seeing the Furby, Tickle Me Elmo and Lorena Bobbitt, I thought it could not get any worse, until one of my heroes, Aaron Karo showed up as a celebrity commentator. This is why you cannot comtinue Runinations? To do I Love the 90's? Hell of a career choice. All I need to see now is Bill Simmons on Around the Horn and I'll know that the sell-out apocalypse has arrived.   I'm Justin, and your body is a wonderland.

      There are your basic necessities in life - food, water, shelter, etc. Yet, you don't see grocery stores and the local water company charging absurd prices for these things, even though they know people can't live without them.  On the other hand, there are airlines. Though the demand for flying isn't quite as inelastic as the basic staples, the bottom line remains, whether for business or pleasure, people need to fly. Seeing this, airlines thrive as some of the most poorly run companies in the world because customers have no choice but to deal with it.   For those of you who haven't been fortunate to hear me rant about it until this point, on a flight back from Costa Rica a few weeks ago an American Airlines employee took the liberty of sifting through my luggage, and 'borrowing' my iPod. After guarding my bag for two weeks in a foreign country, obviously I was thrilled to land and find that someone from the airline I paid $500 to fly on had stolen the only non-clothing item in my bag. I was then sent to the customer service counter to fill out endless paperwork. A nice, and obviously well-versed, American employee suggested, "Just so you know, I never check anything I'm not willing to lose."   Are you serious? Did you just say that?  Well, obviously, if I happen to be traveling with a large gold brick, it's likely that I would choose to bring it on the plane with me (though I can't imagine the ordeal at the metal detectors). But, in all honesty, I have several hundred dollars worth of clothes in there I'd rather not lose, so maybe I should wear them all on the plane (a la Joey wearing Chandler's entire wardrobe). In fact, the backpack the clothes are in cost me about a hundred bucks, maybe I should just carry that on as well. Despite its appropriateness, I'll resist the urge here to transcribe the entire Ben Stiller airplane scene from the end of Meet The Parents.  Can someone explain to me why Southwest isn't the only airline still standing right now? It's the only airline where you can actually use any free trips you've amassed, the only airlines where the employees are friendly and even remotely helpful, the only airline when you can change flight times without paying a months salary, and godforbid you decide at the last minute that you want to go somewhere, Southwest is the only airline that will offer flights under $1000. Still, all the articles you find explain how the government is systematically bailing out each airline that goes bankrupt. Why can't the government just take control of them since they're bailing them out, and just let Southwest run them all? It's like Major League Baseball buying the Expos to bail them out of bankruptcy, but then letting George Steinbrenner and the Yankees run the operation - it would be a Yanks - Expos World Series within two seasons.  So chalk up American Airlines under United on the boycott list...and I'm running out of airlines to fy.

      In response to the random visits in the office, I concur. Todayat work was a good example. I pretty much do all my work in the morning from 6:45 AM to 10:30 AM. Which leaves me to a Milton-like existence in my desk. In fact, everyonein my group was in a Milton-like existence. So I do what any normal human being would do in my position, check my e-mail, readDrudge Report, read the Onion, etc. The president of our company, who by the wayhas a worse tan than George Hamilton, likes to feel important so he walks around the office checking on "productivity" amongst thevarious groups. I always find myself looking over my shoulder and switching windows quickly.     Justin, let's not forget the fact that Shrub went to Phillips Andover who was a steady "C" average and prided himself on the fact that he was the head yell leader at Andover. If you think Choate Rosemary Hall/Choad Rosemary Hall was a bastion of elitism, whoa nelly, there are some peopleat Andover who make people at Choate puke in their tea and crumpets because they're so goddamn elitist.    Also, I love Dallas with one exception. The heat. Its hotter than a monkey's nutsack around here. High was 99, but with the humidity it made it feel like a 112. For the first time I've only run twice in one week. I think I may have gained 3 pounds to my 150 pound frame making me a "heavy" 150 pounds. :) I hope this blog sticks around for a good while. Hope everyone is doing well.    Guapo

      Things I've been thinking about over the last few days:  Flowers. Is there really any subject that the average male is less versed in, but still has to deal with on a regular basis? Literally, there is no other area of our lives where we put this much trust in a "professional" to do something for us. Even when a person has surgery the doctor explains the procedure to the point you feel like you could perform it yourself. But, yet, when you call to order flowers the florist speaks faster than the doctor, while using larger terms such as "rhododendron", which I'm pretty sure is a muscle in your shoulder. Florists also maximize their profits by asking, "What's your price range?" "I guess...um...well...$40-$60." "Okay, we'll go with $60, we can do something nice for $60." What argument can you possibly make to this? Obviously nothing nice can be done for $40, and you can't send flowers that aren't nice. I'm starting to believe that I need a front yard when I can grow one plant of roses, and from now on, no matter what the occasion, that's what I send.  Is there anything worse than the random office visit? Whether you've been working for the last 3 solid hours, or you've been nothing since you walked into work this morning, the laws of nature say that no one will randomly walk into your office until you are a) checking your Hotmail, b) reading ESPN.com, or c) watching some sort of cartoon email forwarded to you by a friend who also received a random office visit while watching the same video minutes before. Only at these most vulnerable moments will a superior of any sort walk in to ask, "How's the brief going?" And as you scramble to switch back to the most official looking program open on your computer (I've learned Alt-Tab is a life-saver here) a huge wave of guilt sweeps over you. The guilt stage quickly dissovles into the aggrivated stage - in which you stare passively at the person's mouth while they give (probably useful) advice, which you completely ignore as you think only about what you were looking at before the person walked in, and that you'll immediately finish what you were doing, before they so rudely interrupted,after they leave.  Note: I incurred two random office visits in the course of typing this, and was rescued by an Alt-Tab back to the memo I finished two days ago, which I opened solely for that purpose.  Austin, Massachusetts (or Texas, but the joke never gets old). After four years in New Orleans I never thought I would find another city I could have so much to say about. Then I moved to Austin for the summer. The dynamic of people in Austin is absolutely incredible. Any other city you go to in America and wear camouflage pants and a pink mohawk people look at you as they walk by in their suits and say, "Look at the freak with the camouflage and mohawk." In Austin however, as you walk to your summer internship, you are under the stares of those in the camouflage and mohawks who whisper, "Look at the freak in the button-down and slacks." I guarantee there is no other city in the country where so many people have the attitude that they are going to do what they want, and that they couldn't possibly care less what anyone thinks of them. Maybe I should move here and be a florist.   And a few shorter things:  Those of you, and you know who you are, who told me that Dodgeball was a better movie than Anchorman, you were absolutely wrong. I will not debate this.  After a weekend of apartment hunting in New York City, a process possibly worse than the first year of law school, I wonder - is it possible that Mary-Kate Olsen is not actually in rehab, but in fact just needed a place to crash because she could not afford her $6000/month rent in TriBeCa on her Full House royalties?  United Airlines sent me one of the most condescending,threatening emails I have ever received in response to my placing an auction on Ebay for Mileage Plus miles I was not going to use. It's fantastic to see that a bankrupt airline that can't maintain its planes or pay its pilots still has a team of monkeys combing Ebay for unauthorized mileage sellers. Put United in the #2 slot on the boycott list, right behind Madigans (the ban imposed there after the Irish Car Bomb incident will never be lifted).

      Guns, fishing, tailgating, and patriotism. These are all things that Southerners love. What they also love is George W. Bush. They love him because heâs one of them. Because he goes to his ranch and plays with a chainsaw. Because he misspeaks and doesnât use any of those fancy edumacated words. Because he wants Osama âdead or aliveâ and because he tells terrorists to âbring it on.â    What Southerners really hate are outsiders, or people unlike them coming in and telling them how to live. They hate Yankees. They hate Ivy League grads. They hate millionaires and the sons of wealth. They hate people who avoid military service.   And yet they love George Bush. Born in Connecticut. Son of a millionaire President, grandson of a wealthy US Senator. Graduate of Yale AND Harvard. A man who had run countless businesses into the ground only to be bailed out by his daddy over and over again. A man who while his poorer peers were off getting killed defending their country was hanging out (or not) in a national guard unit with his buddies, the other sons of privilege.   If I brought a man with this resume into a bar with me in Jackson, Shreveport, Greensboro or Memphis heâd get shunned, if not beaten up by Toby Keith fans. And yet he calls Max Cleland (a man who volunteered to go to Vietnam, lost both arms and legs, and went on to be a Senator from Georgia) unpatriotic. And he says that John Kerry (a decorated Vietnam vet) does not support the military and can not protect America like he can. And he talks about tax cuts for small business owners as the touchstone of his economic recovery plan, ignoring that most small business owners are at least upper-middle class.   So to the average Southern voter, who George W. is counting on for his reelection, I say this: George is not like you. He does not understand your life. He does not care about your life. He cuts down trees as a hobbybecause heâs never really had to do real work for his success, not because he needs to clear land to plant this yearâs crop. He sends your children to war not to protect the American values of freedom and equality, but to gain power and control. But mostly he does things because he can. Because heâs always gotten what heâs wanted, and nobody has ever said no. Your lives and well-being are too important to be trusted to this man who knows nothing about them. So Southern voters, here is your chance. Just say no to George W. Bush. Stop the fraud.

      Imagine a buddy of yours from high school.  One of those guys who never seems to get the girl.  Occasionally he gets a prospect or two, but always manages to screw it up.  Then finally he starts putting the pieces together.  Gets a haircut, some nice new clothes, hits the gym, and starts going out with a girl that not only is right in his newfound range, but also really likes him and wants to get serious.  Then all of the sudden your buddy starts hearing things.  Hottie McHotterson, the captain of the cheerleading squad is having a spat with her boyfriend, Johnny Quarterback.  Now there is no denying that Hottie is, well, a hottie.  But it is well known that she has a major flaw (insert coke problem, airheadedness, or the fact that she went down on at least one guy who's name started with every letter of the alphabet here.)  Hottie knows that the one thing that will piss Johnny off is not only being seen with another guy, but with someone so completely beneath her that Johnny will get desperate and do anything to get her back.  So Hottie walks by your boy's locker, and drops some hints about her and him.  And he immediately starts ignoring his current girlfriend, and dumping other pieces around him to appease her (alienating friends, ignoring grades, etc.)  Now, two things can happen.  She can actually go out with him for a while, and maybe even sleep with him or she can get back with Johnny and not blink an eye.  Either way your boy loses.  If she gets back with Johnny, he's been played for the fool and lost his girlfriend.  Even if she dates your boy, everyone around school knows that she's doing it out of spite, and not for any real love of him.  And there is no chance it will last, since their leagues are so far apart, so even a quick win, like taking her to prom, will be overshadowed by the fact that he let a real long-term possibility go.  It's clear to everyone but your boy with huge eyes that going near Ms. Hotterson is a bad idea, yet he does it anyway.  Unfortunately the situation I've just described is the LA Clippers ridiculous pursuit of Kobe Bryant.  As a lifelong Clipper fan and Laker hater (perhaps the only one known in existence), I just want to yell "Don't you see how he's using you?!?!"  We've finally got a nice thing going.  Elton Brand (Age 25) is an all-star PF, locked up for years.  Corey Maggette (Age 25) averaged 20 ppg at SF last year and is locked up for years.  Quentin Richardson (Age 24) took the leap to 17 ppg, 6 rpg, and 2 apg and is a restricted free agent, whose contract offer the Clippers can match if they get their heads out of their asses.  They've drafted a promising Center and Point Guard in the past 2 drafts and with a few years together might get respectable.  Instead they ignore QRich, start dumping other pieces (Ely, House) and essentially drool all over themselves over the prospect of Kobe (who might just have a flaw or two, and might just be using them to force the Lakers to appease him), while the rest of the world laughs at the idea of Kobe in a Clippers jersey.  I've had a lifetime of disappointment as a Clipper fan, and come to expect things like trading the #2 pick for the #4 and a second rounder, when everyone knows the draft goes 2 deep on uber-prospects (This year).  But until this pursuit, I finally thought they'd figured it out.  Draft solid young players who want to play in LA, lock them up long term and watch them prosper.  Instead, they want a selfish, aloof rapist to be the face of the franchise and failing that, they will simply alienate all of the young stars they currently have. After 23 years you'd think I'd expect this sort of lunacy from the Clippers, but the beauty and curse of being a Clipper fan is that they never fail to disappoint me.  There you go, the first substantive post, and I had to get in a sports one cause it was time sensitive.  I've got some political ramblings coming through the pipeline.  Peace.

      A few more observations on the Olympics.  Is the United States that maligned over the world that people start whistling(the European equivalent of booing) during a US  women's soccer game ?  Come on.  It's women's soccer for crying out loud.  Why are there so many hot chicks on the US women's soccer team?  A good case in point is Heather Mitts, the central defender, who is currently dating AJ Feeley, backup QB for the Miami Dolphins.  It's a rule for all US women's soccer players to date mediocre players in another sport.  If you wanna see who I'm talking about, go to  urlLink www.heathermitts.com .  Yeah, I admit it, I peruse through her site.  As I was watching men's rowing late at night on CNBC, I noticed a familiar face.  The announcers were doing a profile on Jamie Schroeder, who is the second seat in the Men's lightweight fours.  I tried to put a finger on how I knew this kid.  I then figured it out.  I lived across the hall from this kid at Choate my junior year.  All I have to say is this, he's done a quite turnaround.  As Keyser Soze from The Usual Suspects would say,"this guy wasn't just fat, he was Orca fat."  Gummi Bears were this kid's best friends.  Everytime I would see him in his room, he would be eating something, whether it be Twizzlers or ramen noodles.  He was your typical kid at Choate.  He speaks fluent Mandarin, designs websites in his spare time, plays the piano and the guitar, you know, the usual Choate kid.  Now, this kid is a rowing machine.  6 foot 5, 250 pounds, pure muscle.  I couldn't believe it.  If you ever stay up late to watch men's rowing, watch out for this kid.  Hard to believe that a kid who used to eat chili cheese dogs like its his job is now considered the future of US rowing.  The scary thing is he didn't start rowing until three years ago.   In total contrast to the debacle that is the US Men's basketball team is the Iraqi men's soccer team.  If Allen Iverson and co. could even show and put out a 1/3rd of the effort that the Iraqi soccer team showed, no question we would win the gold.  I was just amazed at the unbridled passion and pride this team has displayed.  They went through a lot just to get to Athens.  They had to be airlifted by the Australian air force out of Baghdad just to get to Athens.  Many of them were tortured by Uday Hussein when he was head of the Iraqi Olympic committee.  A lot of Iraqis all over Europe have nothing to be happy and joyful about in Iraq except this team.  When this team scores a goal, literally, fans would jump over the stands, through security, and kiss the players.   With all the tragedy that is going on in their home country, it's good for them to rally around a common cause, which is this team.   Alright, time to get off my pedestal.  I hope everyone is doing well in their respective neck of the woods.  Guapo

      Apparently if I don't write, nobody else will pick up the slack, so though I don't have much to talk about, here goes. I've tried hard to care about the olympics, I really have, but let's be honest, who cares? I watched the opening ceremonies last night...for about 5 minutes before wanting to kill myself. How could anyone watch this for over 30 minutes? We have athletes walking behind a flag, 98% of which have no chance in hell of winning anything, and are just happy to live the olympic dream. Here's the problem though, there are like 10,000 people more qualified in America than the loser they scrounged up from Burkina Faso to get smacked around. Hey, maybe if I move to Barbados and pick up the air rifle I can be an olympian too. I don't know, call me crazy, but I thought the olympics were about athletic competition, not a feel good story to see if we can get the most countries to participate.  So today I flip around for some actual competition, and I stroll upon the badminton tournament. Yes, that's correct, badminton is an olympic sport. I'm pretty sure that I was more athletic playing "World Class Track Meet" on my Nintendo Power Pad. This was just pathetic to watch, and know that these losers will be able to say "I won an olympic gold medal" just the same as Michael Phelps can. Honestly, if this can be a sport, why can't other games involing lazy sacks basically standing around count as Olympic sports? Here are my suggestions:  Mixed Doubles Beirut Hot Dog Eating Pub Crawling Tetherball Dance, Dance Revolution Stairmastering Cite Checking (UVA law would have a strong team)  I just can't get excited about any of this. I mean, women's gymnastics? Yeah, any "sport" that 15 year old girls can be the best in the world at is not for me. Basketball? The first dream team was perhaps the greatest basketball team I've ever watched, but to see our squad with Carlos Boozer and Dwyane Wade losing to Italy just depresses me. The only real intrigue is will any of these guys wear their gold medals to the clubs if they win, as part of thier bling-bling? I hope we win the gold if only for that reason. Handball? Are you serious? I used to dread this during PE and know nobody who plays this after they're forced to. How do we have this and not racquetball? What's next, ultimate frisbee? Hackeysack? Hell, let's get some rollerblade races and every kid growing up in L.A. can dream of Olympic glory.  All this is not to say that I won't cheer on any American I see when flipping past any event. Additionally, I don't know what it says about my perception of the world when I see some non-American win an event and I sit and wonder how somebody beat us.  I just really can't imagine that there is any event that we cannot be the best at with some resources. Now I know what it's like to be a Yankees fan. I just don't understand how we can ever lose.  As usual some thoughts on life:  I couldn't help but notice that HBO has run a follow-up on the Bunny Ranch special. Only this time the story lines seemed a bit far fetched and disturbed me quite a bit. Instead of seeing the heartwarming stories of the young virgin who's mom takes him to a hooker or the couple celebrating thier anniversary with a hooker, we get the stories of a father and son tag teaming because they don't get enough quality time together anymore and the grandma who's husband can no longer perform and who's heart problems prevent him from using viagra. Umm, yeah, next time can we have like a high school cheerleading team in Vegas for a competition who get drunk and all chip in for a hooker? If they're looking for a new writer for the next sequel, I'm available.  After watching the New Jersey Governor resign, the question that immediately popped into my mind was, if I were his wife, would I be more pissed that he had an affair or that he is gay? I mean, if your spouse cheats on you, they are choosing someone else over you. But if they come out of the closet, they are pretty much saying that they were never attracted to you, and the whole marriage was a fraud. Either way, you've got some new self-esteem issues to deal with.  I don't ever recall saying when I grow up, I want to be an estate planning lawyer.  So George Bush has decided to bring almost 100,000 troops stationed in Europe home. In additon to being blatantly political, this move begs to have one question asked. Why do we have almost 100,000 troops in Europe? Are the Nazi's coming back? Is Russia planning an invasion? Did Napolean escape Bill and Ted, leave San Dimas and begin planning his return? Even if any of these things happen, don't Europeans have their own Armies? Just wondering.  Forget marriage, kids, pets, degrees or buying a house. For me, the day I know I'm a real adult is the day I have matching furniture, none of which was purchased at K-Mart, Walmart or Target.  Well, I'm off to watch some sailing, although it just isn't the same now that they're all on steroids.

      I debated all last week whether or not I should keep some sort of running diary, a la the Sports Guy's Draft Day diary, from the Democratic National Convention. My better judgement told me that our 3 readers might not care enough for all of that, so here are some abbreviated thoughts.  I was a political science major, so I am supposedly more of an expert than the layman when it comes to these things. I'll tell you, the only thing I remember from Comparative Politics (Besides the day Mike, Jen Scott and I got daiquiris before class and drank them and got wasted right in class. Yes, that's how you make Phi Beta Kappa at Tulane.) is that in Germany, there are like 10 minor parties that all create alliances with the big boys, and in exchange for their 3.6% of the vote, the little guys get a small piece of their platform on the national agenda and maybe a key speech here or there for a party leader. Was this not the DNC? Let's let Kucinich speak, and get his .8% of crazy war haters; let's let Sharpton speak to get his 2.1% of black militants; let's let Dean speak to get his 5% of hacky-sack playing, granola eating, recent college graduates. Yyyaaaaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhh!! (Sorry Janet.) And isn't Kerry the king of stealing all his good materials from his opponents? I recall shortly after John Edwards' Two Americas and optimistic approach was working, all of the sudden, Kerry was going positive as well. This guy is a political chamelion, more interested in winning than in actually setting any sort of agenda. That much was obvious in the primary season and in the Convention.  My personal favorite performance was Bill Clinton, once again showing to all of us who loved him as President, just how large a mistake it was to screw around with an overweight Jew. He is by far the greatest speaker of my lifetime and a man who inspires us to dream beyond what we think possible. He is brilliant, accomplished and though not as humble as he used to be, you believe it when he talks about a better tomorrow, because he grew up in a single parent household in Hope, Arkansas and became President of the United States. What a shame that when some people look at him, they don't see Rhodes Scholar or World Leader, they only see cigars and sexual relations with that woman.  I thought John Edwards was a bit dissappointing. He essentially gave an expanded version of his primary stump speech. For those losers out there who follow these things on C-Span, this was old news. Particularly sad, not just about Edwards, but all politicians is when you realize that all of their material is scripted. Every joke, every story, every facial expression. You saw the great example of choreography with the "f***ing baloons" not dropping on CNN. It makes you wonder what these guys would actually say if not completely brainwashed by thier handlers.  The greatest line of the extravaganza belongs to the candidate himself. As John Kerry was concluding his speech, he turned to "what if" as a starting point for ideas that we can hope will come to fruition. In the midst of this closing section, Kerry delivered a line that has been overlooked by the commentators, but really summed up what this election is about. "What if we had a President that believed in science?" Isn't this what it all comes down to? The problems with George Bush are that he is stubborn, loyal to a fault, unwavering even when new information arises, and unable to shift opinions. In fact, this is what he attacks Kerry for most, "flip-flopping" when he gets new information on an issue. George W. Bush, who is loved by religious extremists (no surprise, since they don't believe in evolution) because he has seen the data, and seen the effects, and for years has held out that global warming might not exist, and that drilling in ANWAR is a good idea even though it will take 10 years of drilling, which will kill wildlife and ruin the aesthetic beauty of the region, all for enough oil to satisfy US demands for all of 6 months. And let's not begin to discuss how W thinks that stem cells are somehow human life in need of protection. I'm sure the thousands of people dying with curable diseases are happy that their lives are being sacrificed for preservation of stem cells, which will be destroyed anyway. God would be proud. So when you go to the voting booths in November, I don't care if you are in love with Kerry, I certainly am not. The real question is "what if we had a President who believed in science?"  Here are some random things that have crossed my mind:  If I were running John Kerry.com, I think I would sell flip-flops with Kerry for President. Self depreciation, humor, the ability to look at your opponents and call them idiots. It is beautiful. Kerry should play up this "flip-flop" tag by insinuating that it has to do with his ability to process information and make intelligent choices. The underlying attack there is obvious.  If I were the Clippers GM I wouldn't have let Q walk, and then trade for old man Kittles. But, the Clips have never won anything with young, athletic guys with potential star power. Maybe it's time to try proven good players who are what they are.  If I were an idiot, who'd never read Moneyball and didn't understand what really wins baseball games (i.e. objective data and performance, NOT "heart," "hustle," "looking like a ballplayer.") I would think that the Dodgers screwed up at the trading deadline. But since I'm familiar with the concepts that On Base Percentage is the most important offensive stat, with Slugging Percentage just behind, and I know that win-loss records are not at all dependant on the pitcher who owns them, I will give the Dodgers credit for great on-paper moves, that should make them a favorite to win the World Series. With all that said, I'll miss ya Paul LoDuca. Thanks for being a Dodger we could actually like during the Fox era.  If I were a Major League Baseball owner who thought that DC doesn't need their own team, I would drive the almost 3 hours round trip it took me from the DC suburbs to see one game in Baltimore, and do that repeatedly until I realized that these are two separate markets, each capable of supporting a team. Move the Expos now.  If I were a tv producer, I'd try out an episode of Mormon Elimidate. Imagine the intrigue. What could the girls possibly do to impress a guy without 3 way kisses, dancing/grinding/stripping/dry humping on the dance floor or hot tubs? And imagine the shock when the guy is asking what they all do and the answers are not interior design student, bartender, dancer and aspiring actress.  If I ran Maxim's Hometown Hotties, I don't think I'd accept any entries from girls with professional photo shoot pictures, a career listed as actress/singer/model, and the name April. I don't know of anyone who had a girl next door fitting that description.  If I were Mike, I would be very happy that my team just picked up Ricky Ledee as protection for Barry Bonds. As the ESPN announcers during Sunday Night's game said of JT Snow hitting in the 5 hole "I'm not sure he has been protection for Bonds, but he has certainly hit after him." Way to go Giants, thanks for letting us win one.  If I were a female in a power position, like my boss, I don't think I'd say to the young male employee "Hey, can you go out to my car and bring in the new computer, that just seems like the kind of thing a guy should do." Is that sexual harassment?  Finally, if I were Harold Ford, I would be pissed that Barack Obama stole my thunder as the up-and-coming future African American President star in the Democratic party.  What if we had a President who could say nuclear?
