      What have I been up to?  I'll tell you, right about........     1.  Now...   2.  Writing my paper   3.  Watching videos.   I rented  Extreme Measures , which has a good 1st and 3rd act and a rediculous 2nd act,  Once Upon a Time in America , which is so good that it's boring,  American Buffalo  which is so boring that it's good,  Touching the Void,  which made me laugh (uncomfortably) at the extreme misfortune of its characters.  4.  Riding the Lightening.   If you have to ask, you just won't understand  5.  Researching brain substrates of pleasure .  Double cannulae baby, oh yeahhhhhh.  6.  Crying myself to sleep.  Because Dee is away on vacation and I can't use the toilet without her help.  7.   Telling my cat Sausage to shut the hell up.   I swear to God, if he screams one more time...  8.  Preparing for my first anniversary.   I will whisk Dee away to an enchanted land of love, licorice and a latchkey babies.  What?  9.    Listening to Kim talk about moving animal cages with her muscles.   10.  Matt is a powder jockey.  A real mountain meister.   11.  Resisting the temptation to hit something, anything.   Maybe the computer.

       Let's talk about my genes, shall we:    Good Genes: my organs, physique, everything  Bad Genes: my attidude. I'm badasssss.   Selfish Genes: my hair cells. They don't do what I want.   Durable Genes: my Levi 510s  Unstable Genes: my fist muscles. Watch your back.  Foreign Genes: those belonging to Dee that have made their way into my body, via oneroute or another  Sophisticated Genes: my physique, again  Celluloid Genes: my Siskel cells, baby, and my Hackman proteins

      I'm a Mitchum man, so watch out. Night of the Hunter is one grade-A flick and I've just purchased some Mitchum deoderant. It rolls on smooth and fresh, so smooth that yesterday I sat down with a stick of mitchum and a photograph of Robert Mitchum and I, well, y'know.  Mitchum excess, that's what I'm into.That and the death penalty. Me and the death penalty are like this.   What's going on in the lab right now?  -Kim is chowing down and telling me I have Tourettes  -Ben Goodies is trying to curb his addiction to The Postal Service with some afro pie  -Susana is sick of her coffee candies  -Carrie is mixing the fluids  -Allison is scoring videotapes of blurry white blobs that I think are mice

      I may have a veryyoung and depressed blog nemesis:   urlLink kyle.blogspot.com   But what has happened to him since 2001? Is he still out there soiling my good name?   Tom wants to visit Ann Arborand wake up covered in regurgitated sangria after a night of Dominicks. What do YOU think of  urlLink Tom ?   Scott is at my house sleeping right now.Two days agohe found an old, gray cat poo in the downstairs toilet. Yesterday he took a shower and dried himself with a decorative towel, which leftbits of blue fuzzall overhis body.   I had a twilight zone morning today. I'm in line to buy agyroandbehind me walks byagirl with the shortest skirt ever, and its a windy day so she might as well have just been wearing underwear. Pretty rediculous for a crowded art fair. Then I buy my gyro and the cashier says "You come here every morning." And I reply "No, not really." Keep in mind that this isonly mysecond time in 2 years at this place. Then she says "No, you come here. Where do you work?". "East Hall", I say. Shehands me my change and says nothing more.

      From Tom:  "Where's the wednesday blog kyle?  slacking already... punk."   Reply from Kyle:  "Tom is one tasty piece of Manhattan pie!"   For future reference I won't be posting Wednesday blogs on Blog-Tuesdays (see date), or, for that matter, any day of the week except possibly Blog-Wednesdays.  I'm that kind of blogger:  honest, confused and touchy.  The past weekend found me in Linconshire, IL, attending the wedding of my cousin. It was a nice outdoor event with plenty of fun and belligerence.  Check me out:  I ate most of my good luck rice, tossed the rest at the wedding party as they were introduced during the reception, most of which missed and hit the wedding cake, chanted "Rooooooooooooooth" when my grandmother Ruth was toasted. Then I began drinking tequilla. The party train arrived at our hotel at around 1 o'clock with a luggage cart filled three feet high with cases of beer. The concierge didn't like this one bit and demanded to keep a copy of my cousins I.D., which was clearly not a formality. We crammed about 30 people in a little two-bed room. Flippy cup was played, which required stealing the hallway decorative table and ripping off the chain, sending chain links flying everywhere. Someone snuck a strange Red Bull concoction in my place instead of beer. I was angry.  I was sick.  Pizza was thrown. Pipes and cigarettes and empty cans were passed around and scattered about the beds and furnature, which were stacked in the far corner to maximize floor space. The end.

       Check out this  FONT.  Oh    yeah  !         Ok, well, here's an update on  urlLink myself :    I've just finished the final draft ofapaper and am about to submit it to a scientific journal. Two weeks ago finished my masters/candidacy exam which was very long (3 weeks) and involved a paper, 100 references, and a 2 hr defense, during which I was grilled like a hot dog on Cindy Lauper's midriff...cause she's HOT. Speaking of which, doesn't Arnold resemble a nicely charred hot dog on the cover of  urlLink Commando ?   That observation iscourtesy of my wife, Dee, who may contribute to this blog in the future. Or I may just steal her ideas. We'll see.   Ann Arbor art fair starts tomorrow and will consume all available parking spaces. I'm like "That's just stupid, and maybe dumb too" to the fair-goers. They're like "Whatever! Deal with it". And I'm like "Whatever." Then I sulk and kick a few pebbles.  Do I like commas? Yes I do! Colons, not so much.

      I'm going to visit my friend Snowmass St. Rockymountain for one week, so you'll have to find another deliciously witty blog to keep yourselves entertained until I'm back.  My friend Snowmass is crazy.  He skydives and does drugs.  Pot, coke, H, E, XXX, crack, the plague--I've seen him do it, man, he snorts that shit.  Where did the name "Hot Rod" come from, and why is it a name for cars?  It would work better for people.  Like Steve!  He's a hot rod for watching my cats while I'm away visiting Snowmass.  Did I tell you about Snowmass?  He's crazy.

      My skin is welting up due to rat scratches---jealous?  An essay on Steve's xylene troubles recently:  Websters Dictionary defines  xylene  as, "Any of three toxic flammable oily isomeric aromatic hydrocarbons C8H10 that are di-methyl homologues of benzene and are usually obtained from petroleum or natural gas distillates; also : a mixture of xylenes and ethyl benzene used chiefly as a solvent." Steve didn't ask those xylenes for no trouble. But trouble he got--in spades. Steve dipped his tissues in cresyl violet, then water, then alcohol for dehydration. Then came for xylene dipping. Steve lowered in the tissue ever so slowly, carefully, as though rocking a child to sleep (in xylenes!). But the xylenes didn't bubble like they should. Steve was concerned. After a few minutes, Steve removed the tissue and found them to be flaking apart. "What did I do to deserve this flakey tissue? I am a good man and attend church regularly; why can't I catch a xylenes break, God?" With that, Steve shed a few tears and died a little inside.  The end.

      This is what it's like to have a first anniversary:  It's like way cool.  We woke up and watched some tv in bed, which I rigged up the other day.  Then we ate some gormet breakfast/lunch at Cafe Zola.  I had a 5 egg omelette with polish sausage and potatoes, a light breakfast in other words, and Dee had a tasty salad. After a little while, we exchanged gifts.  The theme for first anniversaries is paper:  I wrote Dee a story and Dee made me a really nice shadow box calender of events from the past year--very cool.  Then we drank champagne and joined some friends at Conor's for trivia night.  After that, it was back to bed and television, where we played pattycake and ate a lot of cashews.  Now for some dated news quirks:  Racist wins Tenn. congressional GOP nomination (from Joe):  urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=storycid=684=16u=/ap/eugenics_candidate   The Dutch are sick of unsolicited toe-licking (from Ben):  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/06/crime.toes.reut/index.html   It's just a little alligator swinging (from Tom):  urlLink http://www.stpetetimes.com/2004/07/18/State/Man_accused_of_taking.shtml

      Want to see what I do for work?     http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/researchlabs/berridge/researchteam/kyle_smith/index.html   Want to see what I really do for work?   http://www.synthetictom.com/video/life/laundry.mov   That's right, I'm a  laundromat for hire.  I'll do your laundry reeeeeeal nice.  Know who does good laundry?  Ashton Kutcher, that's who.  He'll brighten yourwhites and darken your earthtones.  He'll have fifteen loads done before you even sit down to eat dinner, no kidding.  And I do mean loads.  Picture a regular load, then multiply it by fifty....that's a Kutcher load for ya.  Ever wonder why he screams so much on his Punk'd television show?  It's because he's doing a load of laundry.  Right there on the set, believe it or not, that'show dedicated to clean clothes he is.  Yeah.  Ok, this metaphor is goingdownhill.  Time to change the subject:  Ashton Kutcher is one hot man-wad.  I'd like to roll him up in breading, bake him at about 450, and sink my teeth into his succulent Kutch.

      Kyle ordered some absinthe from Germany and it should have arrived 2 days ago, so he may have to raise hell with U.S. customs soon....which is always a good idea.  Kyle went to a Tiger's game yeserday. He ate peanuts and cheared on the team, Chet Lemon, Lou Whittaker, all of em. Gibbie hit one out. It was a good day at the ballpark.  Does Kyle know how to spell Whittaker?  Maybe not...  Kyle's gonna stop writing now and maybe do a little pocket-politics. Dee is back, so his gastrointestinal system is flowing nicely.
