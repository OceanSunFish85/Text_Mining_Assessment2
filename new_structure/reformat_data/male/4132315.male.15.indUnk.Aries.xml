      Message: Peter and Tina are sitting in the park &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;doing &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;their friends are having fun with their beloved &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;half. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;now to spend time with. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the only person who isn't with a  date  now. (both &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sigh n silence for a while) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;game &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter: Eh? What game? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: Eem..It's quite simple. You be my &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter: Oookay..Anyway I don't have any plan for &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the next few months. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;day and our first date. Where should we go? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;a really great movie in theater now. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;than this. Lets move. (went to watch their &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;movies and sent each other home) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 2: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 3: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;They went  shopping  together for a friend's &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;birthday present. Share an ice-cream together &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and hugged each other for the first time. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 7: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;watch the sunset together. When the night came &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;by. Tina mumbled something. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 25: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Spend time at a themepark and got onto &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;for a while. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 67: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;They drove pass a circus and decided to get in &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;around to see other entertainments around after &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 84: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;their first kiss with each other just as the sun &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;is setting. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Day 99: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;They decided to have a simple day and is &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;deciding to have a walk around the city. They &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sits down onto a bench. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;1:23 pm &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What would you like? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: Eem...Apple juice will be just fine. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;1:43 pm &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;havent return. Then someone walked up to her. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Stranger: Is your name Tina? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: Yes, and may I help you? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Stranger: Justnow down there on the street a &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;your friend. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;his face and her apple juice still in his hands. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The ambulance came and she went to the hospital &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with Peter. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;11:51 pm &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;He is still breathing now but God would take him &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;away from us very soon. We found this letter &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;inside his pocket. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;burst into tears. Here is what the letter said. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with you during all these days. Although you may &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;these all brought happiness into my life. I have &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;realize that you are a really cute girl and &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;blamed myself for never taken the time to &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for, &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;but I just wish that we can extend the day. I &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;want to be your boyfriend &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;forever and wish that you can be beside me all &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the time. Tina, I love you. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;11:58 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tina: (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;asked God to let us last forever. We were &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;suppose to last 100 days so Peter! You can't &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;leave me! I LOVE YOU, but can you come back to &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;me now? I love you Peter. I LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;As the clock struck twelve, Peter's heart &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;stopped beating. It was 100 days. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;NOTE* &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Tell the guy or girl that you love them before &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;its too late. You never know whats going to &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;happen tomorrow. You never know who will be &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;leaving you and never return

I wanted to tell her, I want her to knowthat I don't want to be just friends, I  love  herbut I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.11th gradeThe phone rang. On the other end, it was her.She was in tears, mumbling on and on about howher  love  had broke her heart. She asked me tocome over because she didn't want to be alone,so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, Istared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine.After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, andthree bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep.She looked at me, said "thanks" and gave me akiss on the cheek.

      When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are inlove. Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love. Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love. If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love. When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone,you are in love. When you get a couple of  free  movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.You keep telling yourself, "that special someoneis just a friend", but you realize that you cannot avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love. While you are reading this page, if someone appears inyour mind, then u are in  love  with that person... -nD-
