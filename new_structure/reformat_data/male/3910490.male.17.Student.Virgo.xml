       Welcome to my WebLog! This will be my primary form of communication to all of you across the pond. As I have told most of you I will not call much during my stay, and writing e-mails back and forth will only keep me back home. By using this form of communication I can let you all know that I am still breathing, and I can read whatever goofy comments you make about my posts. That way there is no direct communication and I can go on living my life as a Nederlander. This is a public blog so save personal stuff for e-mails, but comment as much as you like on what's going on. I will respond to e-mails every few weeks or sooner if it is urgent. I know that may seem harsh but that is just part of the program.        This blog is meant to be a window to the life of an American learning to be a Dutchman. I will update it at least once a week with pictures and stories of life in the Netherlands, or wherever my travels take me. The Netherlands is situated a short train ride away from alot of major places in Europe (London, Paris, Brussels, etc.). The city Iwill beliving in, Zutphen, is about65 miles (105 kilometers) southwest of of Amsterdam.   Iwill beliving with a family (mother - Jannie, father - Imko, brother - Sander, two sisters - Renee and Laura,and a cat - Kyra), and going to an art school called the Vrije School. I leave for this new life 6 August 2004.       I would like to thank everybody at Youth for Understanding ( urlLink www.yfu-usa.org ) for giving me this opportunity and always being so nice, Val Overbey for seeing me through every step of the way (without you I would not have had enough courage to do this), Susan Overbey for scheduling doctors and dentists appointments and helping me gather all the things I needed for this journey, Michael Glick for easingalot of the fears I had, and all of you who have told me to go for it (friends,family, faculty, co-workers, random peopleon buses, everyone)your support means more than you'll ever know. I hope you all enjoy this site. And yeah, I will miss you all too. But I can't be worried about that, there is too much fun to be had. So until I see you all again -        Peace  Love,    David

               Hallo everyone! I donÂ´t have any pictures yet, but I am still learning my way around Zutphen. DonÂ´t worry pictures are coming soon. I arrived in Amsterdam Zaterdag and was met at the airport by Imko and Jannie after which we went to a coffeeshop (a real one, not the kind that IÂ´m sure some of you are thinking), the coffee here is much stronger than what most of you are used to, but it is quite delicious. It was about an hour and a half drive from Amsterdam to Zutphen, but when you talk the whole way the journey doesnÂ´t seem that far. They speak English very well, so does Sandr, Renee and Laura have some problems with it so they just smile and nod a lot. Everyone is very nice here. Texans like to brag about Southern Hosptality, but that does not compare to this. IÂ´ve met some of the neighbors, who are also very nice. Most everyone here speaks English, which makes me feel bad because I know very little Dutch. Not for long though. Next week I will be going to a Dutch Language Camp for the whole week. From what I understand the courses are quite intensive, but i am up for it. Anything to fit in a little easier over here.     Zutphen is a picturesque town with buildings older than our country, some dating back to 1200. Most have either been restored or are in the process of restoration. Imko and Jannie have taken me on tours of the city on bike. Everyone here rides bikes. I never knew that a bike could hold so much, but when we went to the market place in town we just loaded everything up on the bike and rode back home. The city is only about five minutes away by bike, and the trail you take runs right along de Ijssel (pronounced ``eye-sul``) river. This river has a shipping port in Zutphen, which is why Zutphen became such a popular city. Much like in America, places with train stations became popular cities. I have not been anywhere besides Zutphen, but I have only been here a couple of days. We have talked about going to London, Paris, maybe Rome. WeÂ´ll just have to see what time allows. I start school August 23. It is not an art school like I originally thought, but more like an art magnet school. It is very small, even compared to the school I went to.      Today Jannie (pronounced ``Yannie``) and I went to the Stadhuis (``Stathouse`` which is like a city hall) to get a residency permit, but failed to get one because we had not made an appointment, and besides that a lot of people are still on holiday (around this time every year lots of people take several days/weeks off in Europe... nice eh?). We set up an appointment for August 31, so there is no problem, I wonÂ´t be deported.      All in all, IÂ´m off to a great start, and it looks like things are only going to get better from here on out. I hope you are all doing well, and I will write again soon.  Dag!  David
