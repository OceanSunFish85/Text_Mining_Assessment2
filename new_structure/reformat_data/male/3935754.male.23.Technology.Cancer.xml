       Last night was probably the most fun I've had since I've returned from New York, and it ended up being avery theraputic day as well. I worked this morning and ended up taking off in the early afternoon to go to take Pegge and her son Justin to the airport. While I was dreading missing work and getting even more behind on my projects, it turned out to be just the thing that I needed.  On the one hour drive to the airport, I ended up having a really good conversation with Pegge about what my expectations are for the next year. I shared a lot about how I am feeling right now, expressing the emotions that I'm really struggling with. We then talked about how other people in the community are reacting to the changes, and it felt really good to know that I'm not the only one that am feeling the way that I am. I think that everyone is trying to figure out how to process their frustrations, and in some cases - anger. It helps to know that maybe other changes are at hand with how this is going.  I also felt a great deal of clarity towards what I am going to do next year. First off, I talked about how I wanted to do a lot of the "PR" work for University Ministry. I think that we're all in agreement that it would be great to make sure that all communications and marketing is gone through one source, and that we can make sure that we have all the same language about things. I would really like that too because this is an opportunity to for me to develop my creativity. Secondly, I will work with leading and mentoring the Spirit Fire student leadership group, which I also think will be very helpful - both for me and for them. I really enjoy working with these students, and I think that it'll be great chance for me to help them grow to where they need to go as well.  I guess what will be interesting is making sure that I have the appropriate boundries and limitations in what I do. I'm don't think that it'll be easy to do either. It's so easy just to be accepting of what people are asking of me, but at the same time, I need to figure out a way to say "no".  After I dropped Pegge and Justin off at the airport, I went to go see my best friend Kristi for the first time in over a month. Kristi was my best friend in high school and in many ways is still my best friend now. It's amazing how much I'm still able to connect, despite the ways that we've really developed into two different people. What was neat is that as soon as I got there, she came up with the idea of going to a Rockies game. That was the first time in my life where I spontaneously planned on going to a sporting event, and it was an awesome time! The Rockies ended up winning too - something that you don't see too often ;-)  Last night I was hoping just to swing by, maybe have dinner with Kristi, but it was really neat how it turned into a whole evening. I was down there a lot longer than I was planning to, andI was really tired to be getting in at midnight, but at the same time it was a lot of fun.I need to go down to baseball games more often...

       Wow, it's been a while since I've been able to post here. After coming back from New York, and going through all the commotion of life, blogging unfortuantely drops pretty low on the list of things to do - but better late than never, I guess.   My re-entry back into Colorado has been decent for the most part. The flights back didn't seem quite as long as the flights to New York, which was a good thing. The one thing that made things pretty weird about flying back on a Tuesday is it pretty much set the rest of the week back by a day. On Thursday I had some things due at the church that I needed to turn in, and I totally missed the deadline because I seriously thought it was Wednesday. It was the weirdest thing for me! It also made work a lot shorter, which was really cool too.  Things with the whole church situation are still pretty interesting. Last week was the first chance I had to meet with anyone face to face, and no matter how many emails that I wrote, and how many phone calls that I had, nothing could replace sharing your feelings in person. I met with Pegge (the campus minister who resigned) and Emily (from the Spirit Fire student leadership team) on Wednesday, and I didn't realize just how much anger about the whole thing I still had inside of me. And as of today I'm still not quite sure how I can express that anger. I'm really upset with our pastor for hiring the new campus minister, despite the search committee's objections not to do so. I understand that it's his decision to make, and he doesn't really need to take our opinions into account, but at the same time I think it's deceitful for him to do what he did. He makes us go through this search process, pretending that he cares about what he thinks, then later on blatantly disregarding our opinions and not even acknowledging our feelings. I've thought about writing him a letter, expressing how I really feel, but I don't know if that will do more harm then good. I need to find some way to deal with my anger. It's subsided a bit, but that's because I've made a conscious effort to seperate myself from the church activities for the time being.  I think besides the anger that I feel, I also have a great fear for what is to come. I'm really afraid about what's going to happen to the program. I'm afraid that this other program is going to come in and take everything over. I'm afraid that this other program won't give our student leadership team any credibility because we're younger and don't have an adult advocate. I'm also scared that a lot of the responsibilities will fall on me at the same time. I really need to step back and re-evaluate my level of committment. In no way do I want to watch the house that we built fall, but at the same time I'm not going to kill myself trying to keep things afloat. I have a tendancy to say "yes" to a lot of things and not say "no" very often. I hope that it's not going to come back and bite me in the ass.  More to come...

       As my second weekend of traveling draws to a close, I find myself increasingly anxious to be home. For the last two weeks, I have ventured away from Fort Collins over to the East Coast - Poughkeepsie, New York to be exact. I am out here with my mom, two of my three sisters and my uncle visiting my aunt and the rest of their family. We left on Tuesday July 6th and as we're approaching our 13th day on the road I am just anxious to be back in my town, sleeping and my bed and being back with my friends.   What's funny about it though is that it doesn't even feel like two weeks have even gone by. When I booked my plane tickets a few weeks ago I thought to myself "how the hell am I going to be out here for two weeks?", but what's funny is that it's really flown by really fast and hasn't felt like two weeks at all. I think part of it is my working half-days while I'm out there. I think the other part is that we've been so busy too. Between going to New York City, the Yankees game, going to Boston and then going up to Lake Champlain for five days, we really haven't had that much time to be home.  I think the other part of it is the fact that I've been in such close touch witha lot of people from home. The resignation of Pegge, my campus minister and who I've considered my mentor, has really had a significant impact on this trip. Part of me really wishes I was back at home, able to talk to Emily and the other Spirit Fire people. There's another part of me that's thankful for me being away, as I've really had time to process things and being away from the situation. I'm really strugging with how things are going to look when I keep back. I'm really afraid about keeping my boundries, and if I really will be able to keep my distance when I know full well the campus ministry program that I've put so much work into may very well fall apart. You'll find that I'll write more on this later, as this has really become a source of turmoil for me. I don't have time to give the whole History Channel special, but that will come soon enough.  -Late

       Hello, and welcome to my blog.  This seems to have really become quite a fad amonst my friends, and although I am always challenged by keeping and maintaining a journal, I thought I would give it the old college try.  I hope that this becomes beneficial for someone else out there, and invite any comments that you may have.
