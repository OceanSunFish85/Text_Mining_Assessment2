      According to  urlLink reports  today, former Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and presently the firstSecretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge will step down after the November election, regardless of the outcome. The reasons he cites are that "he is worn out from the massive reorganization of government and needs to earn money in the private sector to put his teenage children through college." He's worried about being able to "comfortably" put his kids through college....all two of them. The article also notes that public officials at Ridge's level can "easily earn millions of dollars each year in the private sector."  Included in the report is a snippit of his personal finances:  Salary as Governor from 1995-2001=$138316/year Salary as Secretary from 2001-Present=$175700/year Stocks and Funds=Between $122000 and $787000 House in Bethesda=$873000 (with a $784800 mortgage)  Let's compare this to a blue-collar, single-parent, two-child household in, say, Massachusetts. Hypothetically speaking, a middle-aged secretary at a job for 15 years makes ~$30000/year. (It's a little less, but we're giving ole Tommy Boy the benefit of the doubt). For those slow with division, the poor Secretary makes six times more than the poor secretary. One child went to a private university for ~$35000/year and received minimal federal aid because the parent made too much money. The other child is presently at a state school that is ~$10000/year. All parties involved had to take out interest-accruing loans, cash savings bonds, and use savings accounts to pay for school.  This family was never poverty-stricken by any standards: always had food on the table, always had clothes to wear, always had a roof above their heads, always had cars to get to work, etc. Bills were pretty much month-to-month, and there was not a whole lot of extra money for things. Vacations were rare. I would qualify that as "barely living comfortably". Sure, more money would have helped with expenses, but this family was doing just as well as every other blue-collar, single-income, middle-class family in America (if not better).   I find it disgusting that Ridge would use putting his kids through college as an excuse for leaving his post where he makes $175000 a year. Ifyou're stressed out, just say so. If you hate your job, say so. If you don't think Bush will get re-elected and you're going to lose your job anyway, then say so (tactfully, or else you really  will  lose your job). But to say you can't afford 2 college tuitions as a member of the upper class...priceless.

      Since I go to a pretentious...err, prestigious university now, topics such as  urlLink "rocking the upcollar"  are commonplace. I was in a fraternity in college, and I don't do any of  urlLink these  things. Except maybe wear khaki shorts...and go to the bar...or drink at the house...and have a nickname...or four...and half-tuck.... But seriously, it sounds like this guy's got a southern stereotype of a fratdaddy. The east coast ornortheastern fratdaddyis definitely different. It would involve gel-spiked hair (bleached tips are key) or a trucker hat off-kilter, a half-tucked patterned shirt, weathered jeans with optional petrol wash, and reefs. Pastel polo shirts with up-collar sufficiently rocked are starting to make their way up here, but i feel the patterned shirt will never be jarred from its spot on the pedestal. Pastels just aren't  urlLink hambonish  enough.

      Well, looks like I've decided to enter into the 21st century. Having to learn how to program and update my group's website has made me the most unlikely person to become computer savvy. We'll see if i stick with it or not. I'm not sure on the exact format yet. It'll most likely turn into a collection of my (hopefully humorous) takes on life and random social commentaries. Things that interest me at the moment--be it politically, musically, scientifically, fictionally, non-fictionally, etc.--will also make cameo appearances.

      Apparently  urlLink someone  needs to brush up on their kiddie stories.... As cliche as it is for a liberal to allude to a Michael Moore documentary, more and more every day I can't help but agree that Americans are being beat to a psychological pulp.  If it's not an orange alert one day, it's a "generalized warning" the next.  My new favorite fear-mercial is the  urlLink Coppertone  campaign about just walking outside and getting skin cancer.  (It's actually one of their Flash animations on their home page).  This woman talks about how her mother used to let her play outside without suntan lotion, and then when she was 40-something she developed skin cancer.  Now she slathers her kids, her husband, herself, and everyone she knows (her dog Killer?) with Coppertone brand lotion (but of course) before they step out of her panic room she calls a  urlLink home .
