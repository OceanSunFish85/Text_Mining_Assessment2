        That's right, it's that time of the year again!!           Those of you who have known me for a long time know that I am a flaming retard.  I'm such a retard, that half the stuff I say makes no sense whatsoever.  ...........................  Wait, that's not my point.  You ALSO should know that, every summer, I go to my Dad's house for a week.  Guess what?  I'm going to my Dad's for a week!!  On the week of my Birthday, too....Well, at least I go there knowing that pickles everywhere will fall into trash cans!!           So, my next entry won't be until...maybe two Mondays from now.  I know how much you'll all miss me ^^ ......I expect cool birthday gifts!  MAKE IT SNAPPY!!  *snaps fingers*  XD          RFQD:     *at Burger King*      JoVo:   This is my friend, Mike.      Burger King Employee:   Mmm.      JoVo:   *to Mike* She's a bit primative.      Burger King Employee:   *chuckles*  You funny!

        Yes, I do, in fact, realize I haven't updated in a while.  I blame it on violent television programming.  Think I should sue?  Yes, I realize Sue's a name &gt;_</post></Blog>
