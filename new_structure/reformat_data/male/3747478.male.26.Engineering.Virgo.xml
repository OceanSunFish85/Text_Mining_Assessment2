      Itâs 11:00 p.m. oâclockâ¦â¦â¦..!!!!!!!!!  â¦.hola my friendsâ¦..how are you? Iâm very well because Iâve just finished eatingand drinkingâ¦!!!  Today it has been a very hard dayâ¦because I have worked too muchâ¦.but I prefer this rather than doing nothing..!!  Fortunately itâs Thursday so tomorrow is the last working dayâ¦and I can to go to the beachâ¦under a wonderful sunâ¦with my friendsâ¦.( and can write a lot for my blog..)â¦!!!  I would like totell the story about â  The Barese ghost â.  In my previous article i told about the presence of a ghost in all the houses in Bari cityâ¦.This fact wastold me by my baresi friends!!  In their opinionâ¦â¦when a house is under constructionâ¦..the first person that is near the first brickwork...(of course except the bricklayer)...will became the houseâs protectorâ¦.because his soul willbe forever in this houseâ¦â¦so this big person will have a soul in his body and another in this house..!!!  ..it is a real protectorâ¦.in fact one must never say bad things about himâ¦!!!  I donât believe this factsâ¦.but may be in my houseâ¦therâs a ghostâ¦because I have seen a lot of strange thingsâ¦!!  â¦One dayâ¦may beâ¦..I will tell you all about my house..!!!  â¦Iâm going to my bedroomâ¦because Iâm tiredâ¦.i hope not to find some unpleasant surprises..!!!  â¦see you..

        â¦.itâs Monday eveningâ¦and of course Iâm at homeâ¦in the garden around the swimming pool â¦!! I would like to go out but Iâm very tiredâ¦.so I decided to stay here!!! Now Iâm with Cecio and he is cookingâ¦but right now  Ciccio arrived â¦ of course â¦he is very very hungry.. he is going to the restaurant with Mariellaâ¦because tomorrow sheâll go back to Sicilyâ¦so this is the last night that we are all together!! â¦there is a little problemâ¦!!!  There are a lot of gnats that prick all my bodyâ¦that makes me nervous. Iâm looking for an inspirationâ¦but today it doesnât arriveâ¦may be there is a lot of noiseâ¦I need silence to write!! Because Iâm feeling tiredâ¦.i remember a bareseâs legend that a friend of mine told me. She told me that in every house there is a ghostâ¦but heâs generally a good ghostâ¦he is like a house protectorâ¦!! Sincerely i donât believe itâ¦.but often  funny things have happenedâ¦!! About this funny things Iâll tell you another day!! â¦see you

        â¦ iâm sitting in the garden with my friends Cecio, Ciccio and Mariella, Ciccioâs girlfriend. Cecio is eating a big stuck of meat and Mariella is drinking a glass of red wineâ¦!!! ..but just now Ciccio is going to the bathroom because he has eaten a lof of rise andâ¦â¦â¦â¦.!!! I have also eaten a lot of rise but the consequences have been differently from Ciccioâ¦in fact Iâm writing this article for my blog. Is the 30th of Juneâ¦the top of the summerâ¦and we are here, in Bari City, under a beautiful strewn sky!! Sincerely i would like to be under my real skyâ¦.Sicilian of courseâ¦but Iâm here because I have to workâ¦!! âGRANDE SALVATURâ¦GRANDE CECIONEâ¦.GRANDE CICCIONEâ¦MITICA MARIELLINA..!!! WE ARE A  MYTHIC TEAM..â!!..thatâs a typical sentence pronounced when we are very very happyâ¦and now we are very happy. To complete the beautiful team we miss a lot of friend: DAVIDONE, standing in Rimini since four days, and a lot of pretty girlsâ¦!!! â¦ I finish to write because it is very lateâ¦it is 00:00 oâclock..and tomorrow Iâm workingâ¦so I must wake up very earlyâ¦!!! ..see you later
