      I just finished Demian, written by Hermann Hesse.  Very good book, although I must say that it left me with a lot of unanswered questions.

The main character, Sinclair, is the voice and main character throughout the book.  In a very large nutshell, Hesse takes us through Sinclairs painful adolescence, teen years, college, and eventually places him in the first great world war.  Sinclair has many psychological woes as he tries to understand the meaning of life.  This isn't helped as he runs into a nasty bully (whose name escapes me) who nearly makes him his slave.  We are then introduced to a Max Demian, an intellectual even in his adolescent years.  Max sees "the mark" in Sinclair and decides to take him on as a friend.  Max mysteriously deals with the bully situation, and the two (Sinclair and Max) are henceforth connected for life.  Max makes a series of disappearances throughout the novel, yet never leaves the mind of Sinclair.  At it's climax, Sinclair and Max meet pre war, have many metaphorically symbolic conversations on the meaning and life and the cows of humanity.  Sinclair meets Eva, Max's mother, and falls deeply in love (Couldn't get more Freudian then this).  Their love is never physically consummated, and Max and Sinclair are both sent off to the war.  In its end, Sinclair meets Max in a hospital, yet whether it was real or imagined alludes me.  Max kisses Sinclair, claiming that it was a kiss from Eva.  Sinclair passes out, awakens, and Max is gone.

Surely a poor reading on my part, in particular that I did not put down the questions that concerned me as I referred to in the beginning.  Especially I am thrown by "the Mark" that Max, Sinclair, and Eva share.  I can only assume that this is some sort of metaphysical, angelic, intangible idea. But, as I think more on it, I just might come back and post.

Work calls.

       What is this all about?  I'll think on this and post my thoughts tomorrow.

       Another hot and humid one in Upstate NY. It's barely 8:30, and already the air is fetid, soupy, like a sweat farm. But it's alright. I'm feeling the artificial air condition pumping out near my desk, sitting under these fluorescent lights. I'm living in artificial land. No need to speak with anyone face to face as I have my e-mail. My existential, immature thoughts are working overtime. Work is piling up on my desk, and the post-it notes taunt me with reminders of things that I don't quite remember taking down. 

Tonight I'll run with the Syracuse Chargers in what is to be my first with the group. Should be interesting. 

What else? Oh. What's the deal with mushrooms. They creep me out. I have a plot of grass that I've been trying to grow out front of the house; quite successfully it's been. When I water the grass the night before, I always wake to clusters of these flat topped, musty shrooms. They're like invaders that landed in the middle of the night. They're there when I leave for work, yet mysteriously absent when I return home. Where do they go? And why? WHY?? Perhaps I'm a little too sensitive, but these little invaders are ever so odd. 

Mushrooms. Ourfungi friends of the night.

        urlLink    Here's     something that's been on my mind. 
 
Anyway. It's 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Mid July. It's humid out. Thick like. I am sweatingly. 
 
Ran this morning. Maybe I'm running too much. My body feels a bit...I don't know...damaged. But just slightly. 
 
To be quite honest, I'm not sure what to write. So I'll leave this quote from Robert Frost's "CANIS MAJOR": 
 
I'm a poor underdog,   
But to-night I will bark 
With the great Overdog 
 That romps through the dark

      I like too many things and get all confused and hung-up running from one falling star to another till i drop. This is the night, what it does to you. I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion.

      This is Ginny, my wife and best friend.  She'll hate this picture.  I love it.  urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello

      Not too much to say, really.  Wonder how the weekend will pass?   urlLink   Pig  (click me)      roast on Saturday.  Hiking.  Drinking coffee all the while.  God I love coffee.  It is supreme! I enjoy it   dark .  Or in a cup.  Let us roast the coffee instead of the pig.  

I would like to save this pig and take him/her on our hike.  I suspect the pig is already dead.  I'll not look at the pig as it turns over the fire.  That can't be what the pigs purpose was supposed to be. Is that my purpose?  I said that on purpose.

Hey, Ginny has been pushing the lawn mowing concept.  Sounds like a valid idea.  The grass has grown beyond the standard grass blade size (who decided this size?), hence, said grass needs to be mowed.    I say leave it.    Let it turn back to wilderness.  We could use a new ecosystem in our backyard.  Just think of the birds, the bugs, the smells for god sake. Perhaps a red fox will make a home near the trampoline. 

I suppose I should give up on this idea.  It's madness,really.  There's city codes to follow.

What's wrong with the world today?  Tripping on my worries.  There's nothing to be done about it.  I have my compost pile, my garden in the front yard, my running shoes and bike.  That's my statement to the world.

I'm a liberal.
