						   VOTEKERRYFOR PRESIDENT. Vote John Kerry for the leaderof the free world. If anything I encourage you ALL to vote ...period... You can't complain if you abstain. Voting is a fundamental right its as important as free speech (it IS free speech). Each and every one of us need to voice our opinions, and show the leaders of this country who is really in charge. The people and the peoples voice run this country. That is why we march and protest. Our voice is the reason Gays and Lesbians are finally getting the right of marriage that they deserve. Why you can sit in a classroom alongside our african-american, asian-american, mexican-american, european-american brothers. Why there are wildlife preserves and protected animals. Its the reason women are in the workforce and it was used to secure the right to vote for all women and minority citizens in this country. Your voice is important. Use It.

						   Ok, heres the deal everyone I know uses the terms spoady or jungle juice and such.  well I find that Spoady (however you spell it) isn't as popular as a word that I once thought.  I found harry buffalo on the internet to label fruit chunks and vodka and stuff but nothing listing spoady.  If anyone has a different spelling or a website I would appreciate it.  Your friendly neighbor

						      Ok, this evening Renown and I decided to challenge ourselves to 100 pushups. At this time were both around 40 straight pushups and are giving ourselves 8 months to raise our max by 60%. 100 doesn't sound significant but I challenge you to bust out as many as you can and see where you stack up. I plan on starting my training with doing 20 pushups every hour for as many hours a day that I can. On the home front I'll be able to use my bars and increase the difficulty and reps. I'll throw some partials in there and some diamonds for variation. The challenge is set the number is there and so it begins. t-8months

						   So I feel like I haven't left work in the last 4 days. And I ask you, is it over. No is the answer it is not over. 1 more long 12 hour shift in front of a computer with this thing stuck to my ear. I'm not complaining, work is work, but a window might be nice. I Have seen the light of day for a good hour this week, and I was feeling fortunate :) The day begins and your good your at work your talking your havin a good time, then 4'oclock rolls around. 4 hours in is when it hits you, your first down. This down will go on for about 15 to 20 minutes. No need to stress, no need to break for the coffee yet, its just a trick. So you recover and then whats this its uuummm 8'oclock. 8 sneaks up on you. You look at the clock and see that you should be on your way home right now. You should be standing in your slippas in front of the grill with a brew in hand soaking up some of that beautiful sun. You should be. But there are 4 hours left inside of this room. By this point people have come and gone shifts have changed there are new faces across. And then there is you. the only thing to break the monotony is the pushups every hour. Other then that its just me and the phone the computer and the CLOCK. It's 10 now a little under 2 hours to go, I think I can make it. Tomorrow may be a different story altogether. Day 5 under the 12 hour duty days. Day 5 will feel like a grand occomplishment. And then I will sleep.
